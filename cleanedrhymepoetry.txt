and has the truth brought no new hope at all
heart that youre weeping yet for paradise
do they still whisper the old weary cries
mid youth and song feasting and carnival
through laughter through the roses as of old
comes death on shadowy and relentless feet
death unappeasable by prayer or gold
death is the end the end
proud then cleareyed and laughing go to greet
death as a friend

exile of immortality strongly wise
strain through the dark with undesirous eyes
to what may lie beyond it sets your star
o heart for ever yet behind the night
waits for the great unborn somewhere afar
some white tremendous daybreak and the light
returning shall give back the golden hours
ocean a windless level earth a lawn
spacious and full of sunlit dancingplaces
and laughter and music and among the flowers
the gay childhearts of men and the childfaces
o heart in the great dawn

tenderly day that i have loved i close your eyes
and smooth your quiet brow and fold your thin dead hands
the grey veils of the halflight deepen colour dies
i bear you a light burden to the shrouded sands

where lies your waiting boat by wreaths of the seas making
mistgarlanded with all grey weeds of the water crowned
there youll be laid past fear of sleep or hope of waking
and over the unmoving sea without a sound

faint hands will row you outward out beyond our sight
us with stretched arms and empty eyes on the fargleaming
and marble sand beyond the shifting cold twilight
further than laughter goes or tears further than dreaming

therell be no port no dawnlit islands but the drear
waste darkening and at length flame ultimate on the deep
oh the last fire and you unkissed unfriended there
oh the lone ways red ending and we not there to weep

we found you pale and quiet and strangely crowned with flowers
lovely and secret as a child you came with us
came happily hand in hand with the young dancing hours
high on the downs at dawn void now and tenebrous

the grey sands curve before from the inland meadows
fragrant of june and clover floats the dark and fills
the hollow seas dead face with little creeping shadows
and the white silence brims the hollow of the hills

close in the nest is folded every weary wing
hushed all the joyful voices and we who held you dear
eastward we turn and homeward alone remembering
day that i loved day that i loved the night is here

they sleep within
i cower to the earth i waking i only
high and cold thou dreamest o queen highdreaming and lonely
we have slept too long who can hardly win
the white one flame and the nightlong crying
the viewless passers the worlds low sighing
with desire with yearning
to the fire unburning
to the heatless fire to the flameless ecstasy
helpless i lie

and around me the feet of thy watchers tread
there is a rumour and a radiance of wings above my head
an intolerable radiance of wings
all the earth grows fire
white lips of desire
brushing cool on the forehead croon slumbrous things
earth fades and the air is thrilled with ways
dewy paths full of comfort and radiant bands
the gracious presence of friendly hands
help the blind one the glad one who stumbles and strays
stretching wavering hands up up through the praise
of a myriad silver trumpets through cries
to all glory to all gladness to the infinite height
to the gracious the unmoving the mother eyes
and the laughter and the lips of light

id watched the sorrow of the evening sky
and smelt the sea and earth and the warm clover
and heard the waves and the seagulls mocking cry
and in them all was only the old cry
that song they always sing the best is over
you may remember now and think and sigh
o silly lover
and i was tired and sick that all was over
and because i
for all my thinking never could recover
one moment of the good hours that were over
and i was sorry and sick and wished to die

then from the sad west turning wearily
i saw the pines against the white north sky
very beautiful and still and bending over
their sharp black heads against a quiet sky
and there was peace in them and i
was happy and forgot to play the lover
and laughed and did no longer wish to die
being glad of you o pinetrees and the sky

creeps in half wanton half asleep
one with a fat wide hairless face
he likes lovemusic that is cheap
likes women in a crowded place
and wants to hear the noise theyre making




his heavy eyelids droop halfover
great pouches swing beneath his eyes
he listens thinks himself the lover
heaves from his stomach wheezy sighs
he likes to feel his hearts abreaking

the music swells his gross legs quiver
his little lips are bright with slime
the music swells the women shiver
and all the while in perfect time
his pendulous stomach hangs ashaking

slowly up silent peaks the white edge of the world
trod four archangels clear against the unheeding sky
bearing with quiet even steps and great wings furled
a little dingy coffin where a child must lie
it was so tiny yet you had fancied god could never
have bidden a child turn from the spring and the sunlight
and shut him in that lonely shell to drop for ever
into the emptiness and silence into the night


they then from the sheer summit cast and watched it fall
through unknown glooms that frail black coffin and therein
gods little pitiful body lying worn and thin
and curled up like some crumpled lonely flowerpetal
till it was no more visible then turned again
with sorrowful quiet faces downward to the plain

swiftly out from the friendly lilt of the band
the crowds good laughter the loved eyes of men
i am drawn nightward i must turn again
where down beyond the low untrodden strand
there curves and glimmers outward to the unknown
the old unquiet ocean all the shade
is rife with magic and movement i stray alone
here on the edge of silence half afraid

waiting a sign in the deep heart of me
the sullen waters swell towards the moon
and all my tides set seaward from inland
leaps a gay fragment of some mocking tune
that tinkles and laughs and fades along the sand
and dies between the seawall and the sea

she was wrinkled and huge and hideous she was our mother
she was lustful and lewd but a god we had none other
in the day she was hidden and dumb but at nightfall moaned in the shade
we shuddered and gave her her will in the darkness we were afraid

she sent us pain
and we bowed before her
she smiled again
and bade us adore her
she solaced our woe
and soothed our sighing
and what shall we do
now god is dying

she was hungry and ate our children how should we stay her
she took our young men and our maidens ours to obey her
we were loathed and mocked and reviled of all nations that was our pride
she fed us protected us loved us and killed us now she has died

she was so strong
but death is stronger
she ruled us long
but time is longer
she solaced our woe
and soothed our sighing
and what shall we do
now god is dying

what light of unremembered skies
hast thou relumed within our eyes
thou whom we seek whom we shall find
a certain odour on the wind
thy hidden face beyond the west
these things have called us on a quest
older than any road we trod
more endless than desirefar god
sigh with thy cruel voice that fills
the soul with longing for dim hills
and faint horizons for there come
grey moments of the antient dumb
sickness of travel when no song
can cheer us but the way seems long
and one remembers ah the beat
of weary unreturning feet
and songs of pilgrims unreturning
the fires we left are always burning
on the old shrines of home our kin
have built them temples and therein
pray to the gods we know and dwell
in little houses lovable
being happy we remember how
and peaceful even to death o thou
god of all long desirous roaming
our hearts are sick of fruitless homing
and crying after lost desire
hearten us onward as with fire
consuming dreams of other bliss
the best thou givest giving this
sufficient thing to travel still
over the plain beyond the hill
unhesitating through the shade
amid the silence unafraid
till at some sudden turn one sees
against the black and muttering trees
thine altar wonderfully white
among the forests of the night

come away come away
ye are sober and dull through the common day
but now it is night
it is shameful night and god is asleep
have you not felt the quick fires that creep
through the hungry flesh and the lust of delight
and hot secrets of dreams that day cannot say

the house is dumb
the night calls out to you come ah come
down the dim stairs through the creaking door
naked crawling on hands and feet
it is meet it is meet
ye are men no longer but less and more
beast and god down the lampless street

by little black ways and secret places
in the darkness and mire
faint laughter around and evil faces
by the starglint seen ah follow with us
for the darkness whispers a blind desire
and the fingers of night are amorous

because god put his adamantine fate
between my sullen heart and its desire
i swore that i would burst the iron gate
rise up and curse him on his throne of fire
earth shuddered at my crown of blasphemy
but love was as a flame about my feet
proud up the golden stair i strode and beat
thrice on the gate and entered with a cry

all the great courts were quiet in the sun
and full of vacant echoes moss had grown
over the glassy pavement and begun
to creep within the dusty councilhalls
an idle wind blew round an empty throne
and stirred the heavy curtains on the walls

before thy shrine i kneel an unknown worshipper
chanting strange hymns to thee and sorrowful litanies
incense of dirges prayers that are as holy myrrh
ah goddess on thy throne of tears and faint low sighs
weary at last to theeward come the feet that err
and empty hearts grown tired of the worlds vanities
how fair this cool deep silence to a wanderer
deaf with the roar of winds along the open skies
sweet after sting and bitter kiss of seawater
the pale lethean wine within thy chalices
i come before thee i too tired wanderer
to heed the horror of the shrine the distant cries
and evil whispers in the gloom or the swift whirr
of terrible wings i least of all thy votaries
with a faint hope to see the scented darkness stir
and parting frame within its quiet mysteries
one face with lips than autumnlilies tenderer
and voice more sweet than the far plaint of viols is
or the soft moan of any greyeyed luteplayer

opposite me two germans snore and sweat
through sullen swirling gloom we jolt and roar
we have been here for ever even yet
a dim watch tells two hours two aeons more
the windows are tightshut and slimywet
with a nights foetor there are two hours more
two hours to dawn and milan two hours yet
opposite me two germans sweat and snore

one of them wakes and spits and sleeps again
the darkness shivers a wan light through the rain
strikes on our faces drawn and white somewhere
a new day sprawls and inside the foul air
is chill and damp and fouler than before
opposite me two germans sweat and snore

out of the nothingness of sleep
the slow dreams of eternity
there was a thunder on the deep
i came because you called to me

i broke the nights primeval bars
i dared the old abysmal curse
and flashed through ranks of frightened stars
suddenly on the universe

the eternal silences were broken
hell became heaven as i passed
what shall i give you as a token
a sign that we have met at last

ill break and forge the stars anew
shatter the heavens with a song
immortal in my love for you
because i love you very strong

your mouth shall mock the old and wise
your laugh shall fill the world with flame
ill write upon the shrinking skies
the scarlet splendour of your name

till heaven cracks and hell thereunder
dies in her ultimate mad fire
and darkness falls with scornful thunder
on dreams of men and mens desire

then only in the empty spaces
death walking very silently
shall fear the glory of our faces
through all the dark infinity

so clothed about with perfect love
the eternal end shall find us one
alone above the night above
the dust of the dead gods alone

is it the hour we leave this restingplace
made fair by one another for a while
now for a godspeed one last mad embrace
the long road then unlit by your faint smile
ah the long road and you so far away
oh ill remember but each crawling day
will pale a little your scarlet lips each mile
dull the dear pain of your remembered face

do you think theres a far border town somewhere
the deserts edge last of the lands we know
some gaunt eventual limit of our light
in which ill find you waiting and well go
together hand in hand again out there
into the waste we know not into the night





some day i shall rise and leave my friends
and seek you again through the worlds far ends
you whom i found so fair
touch of your hands and smell of your hair
my only god in the days that were




my eager feet shall find you again
though the sullen years and the mark of pain
have changed you wholly for i shall know
how could i forget having loved you so
in the sad halflight of evening
the face that was all my sunrising
so then at the ends of the earth ill stand
and hold you fiercely by either hand
and seeing your age and ashen hair
ill curse the thing that once you were
because it is changed and pale and old
lips that were scarlet hair that was gold




and i loved you before you were old and wise
when the flame of youth was strong in your eyes
and my heart is sick with memories





oh death will find me long before i tire
of watching you and swing me suddenly
into the shade and loneliness and mire
of the last land there waiting patiently




one day i think ill feel a cool wind blowing
see a slow light across the stygian tide
and hear the dead about me stir unknowing
and tremble and i shall know that you have died




and watch you a broadbrowed and smiling dream
pass light as ever through the lightless host
quietly ponder start and sway and gleam
most individual and bewildering ghost




and turn and toss your brown delightful head
amusedly among the ancient dead





i said i splendidly loved you its not true
such long swift tides stir not a landlocked sea
on gods or fools the high risk falls on you
the clean clear bittersweet thats not for me
love soars from earth to ecstasies unwist
love is flung luciferlike from heaven to hell
but there are wanderers in the middle mist
who cry for shadows clutch and cannot tell
whether they love at all or loving whom
an old songs lady a fool in fancy dress
or phantoms or their own face on the gloom
for love of love or from hearts loneliness
pleasures not theirs nor pain they doubt and sigh
and do not love at all of these am i





i think if you had loved me when i wanted
if id looked up one day and seen your eyes
and found my wild sick blasphemous prayer granted
and your brown face thats full of pity and wise
flushed suddenly the white godhead in new fear
intolerably so struggling and so shamed
most holy and far if youd come all too near
if earth had seen earths lordliest wild limbs tamed
shaken and trapped and shivering for my touch
myself should i have slain or that foul you
but this the strange gods who had given so much
to have seen and known you this they might not do
one last shames spared me one black words unspoken
and im alone and you have not awoken





when the white flame in us is gone
and we that lost the worlds delight
stiffen in darkness left alone
to crumble in our separate night




when your swift hair is quiet in death
and through the lips corruption thrust
has stilled the labour of my breath
when we are dust when we are dust




not dead not undesirous yet
still sentient still unsatisfied
well ride the air and shine and flit
around the places where we died




and dance as dust before the sun
and light of foot and unconfined
hurry from road to road and run
about the errands of the wind




and every mote on earth or air
will speed and gleam down later days
and like a secret pilgrim fare
by eager and invisible ways




nor ever rest nor ever lie
till beyond thinking out of view
one mote of all the dust thats i
shall meet one atom that was you




then in some garden hushed from wind
warm in a sunsets afterglow
the lovers in the flowers will find
a sweet and strange unquiet grow




upon the peace and past desiring
so high a beauty in the air
and such a light and such a quiring
and such a radiant ecstasy there




theyll know not if its fire or dew
or out of earth or in the height
singing or flame or scent or hue
or two that pass in light to light




out of the garden higher higher
but in that instant they shall learn
the shattering ecstasy of our fire
and the weak passionless hearts will burn




and faint in that amazing glow
until the darkness close above
and they will know poor fools theyll know
one moment what it is to love





when love has changed to kindliness
oh love our hungry lips that press
so tight that times an old gods dream
nodding in heaven and whisper stuff
seven million years were not enough
to think on after make it seem
less than the breath of children playing
a blasphemy scarce worth the saying
a sorry jest when love has grown
to kindliness to kindliness
and yet the best that eithers known
will change and wither and be less
at last than comfort or its own
remembrance and when some caress




tendered in habit once a flame
all heaven sang out to wakes the shame
unworded in the steady eyes
well have that day what shall we do
being so noble kill the two
whove reached their secondbest being wise
break cleanly off and get away
follow down other windier skies
new lures alone or shall we stay
since this is all weve known content
in the lean twilight of such day
and not remember not lament




that time when all is over and
hand never flinches brushing hand
and blood lies quiet for all youre near
and its but spoken words we hear
where trumpets sang when the mere skies
are stranger and nobler than your eyes
and flesh is flesh was flame before
and infinite hungers leap no more
in the chance swaying of your dress
and love has changed to kindliness





as those of old drank mummia
to fire their limbs of lead
making dead kings from africa
stand pandar to their bed




drunk on the dead and medicined
with spiced imperial dust
in a short night they reeled to find
ten centuries of lust




so i from paint stone tale and rhyme
stuffed loves infinity
and sucked all lovers of all time
to rarify ecstasy




helens the hair shuts out from me
veronas livid skies
gypsy the lips i press and see
two antonys in your eyes




the unheard invisible lovely dead
lie with us in this place
and ghostly hands above my head
close face to straining face




their blood is wine along our limbs
their whispering voices wreathe
savage forgotten drowsy hymns
under the names we breathe




woven from their tomb and one with it
the night wherein we press
their thousand pitchy pyres have lit
your flaming nakedness




for the uttermost years have cried and clung
to kiss your mouth to mine
and hair long dust was caught was flung
hand shaken to hand divine




and life has fired and death not shaded
all times uncounted bliss
and the height o the world has flamed and faded
love that our love be this





in a cool curving world he lies
and ripples with dark ecstasies
the kind luxurious lapse and steal
shapes all his universe to feel
and know and be the clinging stream
closes his memory glooms his dream
who lips the roots o the shore and glides
superb on unreturning tides
those silent waters weave for him
a fluctuant mutable world and dim
where wavering masses bulge and gape
mysterious and shape to shape
dies momently through whorl and hollow
and form and line and solid follow
solid and line and form to dream
fantastic down the eternal stream
an obscure world a shifting world
bulbous or pulled to thin or curled
or serpentine or driving arrows
or serene slidings or march narrows
there slipping wave and shore are one
and weed and mud no ray of sun
but glow to glow fades down the deep
as dream to unknown dream in sleep
shaken translucency illumes
the hyaline of drifting glooms
the strange softhanded depth subdues
drowned colour there but black to hues
as death to living decomposes
red darkness of the heart of roses
blue brilliant from dead starless skies
and gold that lies behind the eyes
the unknown unnameable sightless white
that is the essential flame of night
lustreless purple hooded green
the myriad hues that lie between
darkness and darkness and alls one
gentle embracing quiet dun
the world he rests in world he knows
perpetual curving only grows
an eddy in that ordered falling
a knowledge from the gloom a calling
weed in the wave gleam in the mud
the dark fire leaps along his blood
dateless and deathless blind and still
the intricate impulse works its will
his woven world drops back and he
sans providence sans memory
unconscious and directly driven
fades to some dank sufficient heaven




o world of lips o world of laughter
where hope is fleet and thought flies after
of lights in the clear night of cries
that drift along the wave and rise
thin to the glittering stars above
you know the hands the eyes of love
the strife of limbs the sightless clinging
the infinite distance and the singing
blown by the wind a flame of sound
the gleam the flowers and vast around
the horizon and the heights above
you know the sigh the song of love




but there the night is close and there
darkness is cold and strange and bare
and the secret deeps are whisperless
and rhythm is all deliciousness
and joy is in the throbbing tide
whose intricate fingers beat and glide
in felt bewildering harmonies
of trembling touch and music is
the exquisite knocking of the blood
space is no more under the mud
his bliss is older than the sun
silent and straight the waters run
the lights the cries the willows dim
and the dark tide are one with him





how can we find how can we rest how can
we being gods win joy or peace being man
we the gaunt zanies of a witless fate
who love the unloving and lover hate
forget the moment ere the moment slips
kiss with blind lips that seek beyond the lips
who want and know not what we want and cry
with crooked mouths for heaven and throw it by
loves for completeness no perfection grows
twixt leg and arm elbow and ear and nose
and joint and socket but unsatisfied
sprawling desires shapeless perverse denied
finger with finger wreathes we love and gape
fantastic shape to mazed fantastic shape
straggling irregular perplexed embossed
grotesquely twined extravagantly lost
by crescive paths and strange protuberant ways
from sanity and from wholeness and from grace
how can love triumph how can solace be
where fever turns toward fever knee toward knee
could we but fill to harmony and dwell
simple as our thought and as perfectible
rise disentangled from humanity
strange whole and new into simplicity
grow to a radiant round love and bear
unfluctuant passion for some perfect sphere
love moon to moon unquestioning and be
like the star lunisequa steadfastly
following the round clear orb of her delight
patiently ever through the eternal night





voices out of the shade that cried
and long noon in the hot calm places
and childrens play by the wayside
and country eyes and quiet faces
all these were round my steady paces




those that i could have loved went by me
cool gardened homes slept in the sun
i heard the whisper of water nigh me
saw hands that beckoned shone were gone
in the green and gold and i went on




for if my echoing footfall slept
soon a far whispering thered be
of a little lonely wind that crept
from tree to tree and distantly
followed me followed me




but the blue vaporous end of day
brought peace and pursuit baffled quite
where between pinewoods dipped the way
i turned slipped in and out of sight
i trod as quiet as the night




the pineboles kept perpetual hush
and in the boughs wind never swirled
i found a flowering lowly bush
and bowed slid in and sighed and curled
hidden at rest from all the world




safe i was safe and glad i knew
yet with cold heart and cold wet brows
i lay and the dark fell there grew
meward a sound of shaken boughs
and ceased above my intricate house




and silence silence silence found me
i felt the unfaltering movement creep
among the leaves they shed around me
calm clouds of scent that i did weep
and stroked my face i fell asleep





breathless we flung us on the windy hill
laughed in the sun and kissed the lovely grass
you said through glory and ecstasy we pass
wind sun and earth remain the birds sing still
when we are old are old and when we die
alls over that is ours and life burns on
through other lovers other lips said i
heart of my heart our heaven is now is won




we are earths best that learnt her lesson here
life is our cry we have kept the faith we said
we shall go down with unreluctant tread
rosecrowned into the darkness proud we were
and laughed that had such brave true things to say
and then you suddenly cried and turned away





i dreamt i was in love again
with the one before the last
and smiled to greet the pleasant pain
of that innocent young past




but i jumped to feel how sharp had been
the pain when it did live
how the faded dreams of nineteenten
were hell in nineteenfive




the boys woe was as keen and clear
the boys love just as true
and the one before the last my dear
hurt quite as much as you




sickly i pondered how the lover
wrongs the unanswering tomb
and sentimentalizes over
what earned a better doom




gently he tombs the poor dim last time
strews pinkish dust above
and sighs the dear dead boyish pastime
but this ah god is love




better oblivion hide dead true loves
better the night enfold
than men to eke the praise of new loves
should lie about the old




oh bitter thoughts i had in plenty
but heres the worst of it
i shall forget in nineteentwenty
you ever hurt abit





the stars a jolly company
i envied straying late and lonely
and cried upon their revelry
o white companionship you only
in love in faith unbroken dwell
friends radiant and inseparable




lightheart and glad they seemed to me
and merry comrades even so
god out of heaven may laugh to see
the happy crowds and never know
that in his lone obscure distress
each walketh in a wilderness




but i remembering pitied well
and loved them who with lonely light
in empty infinite spaces dwell
disconsolate for all the night
i heard the thin gnatvoices cry
star to faint star across the sky





he wakes who never thought to wake again
who held the end was death he opens eyes
slowly to one long livid oozing plain
closed down by the strange eyeless heavens
he lies
and waits and once in timeless sick surmise
through the dead air heaves up an unknown hand
like a dry branch no life is in that land
himself not lives but is a thing that cries
an unmeaning point upon the mud a speck
of moveless horror an immortal one
cleansed of the world sentient and dead a fly
faststuck in grey sweat on a corpses neck
i though when love for you died i should die
its dead alone most strangely i live on





swings the way still by hollow and hill
and all the worlds a song
shes far it sings me but fair it rings me
quiet it laughs and strong




oh spite of the miles and years between us
spite of your chosen part
i do remember and i go
with laughter in my heart




so above the little folk that know not
out of the white hilltown
high up i clamber and i remember
and watch the day go down




gold is my heart and the worlds golden
and one peak tipped with light
and the air lies still about the hill
with the first fear of night




till mystery down the soundless valley
thunders and dark is here
and the wind blows and the light goes
and the night is full of fear




and i know one night on some far height
in the tongue i never knew
i yet shall hear the tidings clear
from them that were friends of you




theyll call the news from hill to hill
dark and uncomforted
earth and sky and the winds and i
shall know that you are dead




i shall not hear your trentals
nor eat your arval bread
for the kin of you will surely do
their duty by the dead




their little dull greasy eyes will water
theyll paw you and gulp afresh
theyll sniffle and weep and their thoughts will creep
like flies on the cold flesh




they will put pence on your grey eyes
bind up your fallen chin
and lay you straight the fools that loved you
because they were your kin

they will praise all the bad about you
and hush the good away
and wonder how theyll do without you
and then theyll go away




but quieter than one sleeping
and stranger than of old
you will not stir for weeping
you will not mind the cold




but through the night the lips will laugh not
the hands will be in place
and at length the hair be lying still
about the quiet face




with snuffle and sniff and handkerchief
and dim and decorous mirth
with ham and sherry theyll meet to bury
the lordliest lass of earth




the little dead hearts will tramp ungrieving
behind loneriding you
the heart so high the heart so living
heart that they never knew




i shall not hear your trentals
nor eat your arval bread
nor with smug breath tell lies of death
to the unanswering dead




with snuffle and sniff and handkerchief
the folk who loved you not
will bury you and go wondering
back home and you will rot




but laughing and halfway up to heaven
with wind and hill and star
i yet shall keep before i sleep
your ambarvalia





there was a damned successful poet
there was a woman like the sun
and they were dead they did not know it
they did not know their time was done
they did not know his hymns
were silence and her limbs
that had served love so well
dust and a filthy smell




and so one day as ever of old
hands out they hurried knee to knee
on fire to cling and kiss and hold
and in the others eyes to see
each his own tiny face
and in that long embrace
feel lip and breast grow warm
to breast and lip and arm




so knee to knee they sped again
and laugh to laugh they ran im told
across the streets of hell and then
they suddenly felt the wind blow cold
and knew so closely pressed
chill air on lip and breast
and with a sick surprise
the emptiness of eyes





here where loves stuff is body arm and side
are stabbingsweet gainst chair and lamp and wall
in every touch more intimate meanings hide
and flaming brains are the white heart of all




here million pulses to one centre beat
closed in by mens vast friendliness alone
two can be drunk with solitude and meet
on the sheer point where sense with knowings one




here the greenpurple clanging royal night
and the straight lines and silent walls of town
and roar and glare and dust and myriad white
undying passers pinnacle and crown




intensest heavens between closelying faces
by the lamps airless fierce ecstatic fire
and weve found love in little hidden places
under great shades between the mist and mire




stay though the woods are quiet and youve heard
night creep along the hedges never go
where tangled foliage shrouds the crying bird
and the remote winds sigh and waters flow




lest as our words fall dumb on windless noons
or hearts grow hushed and solitary beneath
unheeding stars and unfamiliar moons
or boughs bend over close and quiet as death




unconscious and unpassionate and still
cloudlike we lean and stare as bright leaves stare
and gradually along the stranger hill
our unwalled loves thin out on vacuous air




and suddenly theres no meaning in our kiss
and your lit upward face grows where we lie
lonelier and dreadfuller than sunlight is
and dumb and mad and eyeless like the sky





for moveless limbs no pity i crave
that never were swift still all i prize
laughter and thought and friends i have
no fool to heave luxurious sighs
for the woods and hills that i never knew
the more excellent ways yet mine and you




flowerladen come to the clean white cell
and we talk as ever am i not the same
with our hearts we love immutable
you without pity i without shame
we talk as of old as of old you go
out under the sky and laughing i know




flit through the streets your heart all me
till you gain the world beyond the town
then i fade from your heart quietly
and your fleet steps quicken the strong down
smiles you welcome there the woods that love you
close lovely and conquering arms above you




o evermoving o lithe and free
fast in my linen prison i press
on impassable bars or emptily
laugh in my great loneliness
and still in the white neat bed i strive
most impotently against that gyve
being less now than a thought even
to you alone with your hills and heaven





hot through troys ruin menelaus broke
to priams palace sword in hand to sate
on that adulterous whore a ten years hate
and a kings honour through red death and smoke
and cries and then by quieter ways he strode
till the still innermost chamber fronted him
he swung his sword and crashed into the dim
luxurious bower flaming like a god




high sat white helen lonely and serene
he had not remembered that she was so fair
and that her neck curved down in such a way
and he felt tired he flung the sword away
and kissed her feet and knelt before her there
the perfect knight before the perfect queen




so far the poet how should he behold
that journey home the long connubial years
he does not tell you how white helen bears
child on legitimate child becomes a scold
haggard with virtue menelaus bold
waxed garrulous and sacked a hundred troys
twixt noon and supper and her golden voice
got shrill as he grew deafer and both were old




often he wonders why on earth he went
troyward or why poor paris ever came
oft she weeps gummyeyed and impotent
her dry shanks twitch at paris mumbled name
so menelaus nagged and helen cried
and paris slept on by scamander side





how should i know the enormous wheels of will
drove me coldeyed on tired and sleepless feet
night was void arms and you a phantom still
and day your far light swaying down the street
as never fool for love i starved for you
my throat was dry and my eyes hot to see
your mouth so lying was most heaven in view
and your remembered smell most agony




love wakens love i felt your hot wrist shiver
and suddenly the mad victory i planned
flashed real in your burning bending head
my conquerors blood was cool as a deep river
in shadow and my heart beneath your hand
quieter than a dead man on a bed





when i see you who were so wise and cool
gazing with silly sickness on that fool
youve given your love to your adoring hands
touch his so intimately that each understands
i know most hidden things and when i know
your holiest dreams yield to the stupid bow
of his red lips and that the empty grace
of those strong legs and arms that rosy face
has beaten your heart to such a flame of love
that you have given him every touch and move
wrinkle and secret of you all your life
oh then i know im waiting loverwife
for the great time when love is at a close
and all its fruits to watch the thickening nose
and sweaty neck and dulling face and eye
that are yours and you most surely till you die
day after day youll sit with him and note
the greasier tie the dingy wrinkling coat
as prettiness turns to pomp and strength to fat
and love love love to habit and after that
when all thats fine in man is at an end
and you that loved young life and clean must tend
a foul sick fumbling dribbling body and old
when his rare lips hang flabby and cant hold
slobber and youre enduring that worst thing
senilitys queasy furtive lovemaking
and searching those dear eyes for human meaning
propping the bald and helpless head and cleaning
a scrap that lifes flung by and loves forgotten
then youll be tired and passion dead and rotten
and hell be dirty dirty o lithe and free
and lightfoot that the poor heart cries to see
thats how ill see your man and you but you
oh when that time comes youll be dirty too





my restless blood now lies aquiver
knowing that always exquisitely
this april twilight on the river
stirs anguish in the heart of me




for the fast world in that rare glimmer
puts on the witchery of a dream
the straight grey buildings richly dimmer
the fiery windows and the stream




with willows leaning quietly over
the still ecstatic fading skies
and all these like a waiting lover
murmur and gleam lift lustrous eyes




drift close to me and sideways bending
whisper delicious words but i
stretch terrible hands uncomprehending
shaken with love and laugh and cry




my agony made the willows quiver
i heard the knocking of my heart
die loudly down the windless river
i heard the pale skies fall apart




and the shrill stars unmeaning laughter
and my voice with the vocal trees
weeping and hatred followed after
shrilling madly down the breeze




in peace from the wild heart of clamour
a flower in moonlight she was there
was rippling down white ways of glamour
quietly laid on wave and air




her passing left no leaf aquiver
pale flowers wreathed her white white brows
her feet were silence on the river
and hush she said between the boughs





oh love they said is king of kings
and triumph is his crown
earth fades in flame before his wings
and sun and moon bow down
but that i knew would never do
and heaven is all too high
so whenever i meet a queen i said
i will not catch her eye




oh love they said and love they said
the gift of love is this
a crown of thorns about thy head
and vinegar to thy kiss
but tragedy is not for me
and im content to be gay
so whenever i spied a tragic lady
i went another way




and so i never feared to see
you wander down the street
or come across the fields to me
on ordinary feet
for what theyd never told me of
and what i never knew
it was that all the time my love
love would be merely you





when you were there and you and you
happiness crowned the night i too
laughing and looking one of all
i watched the quivering lamplight fall
on plate and flowers and pouring tea
and cup and cloth and they and we
flung all the dancing moments by
with jest and glitter lip and eye
flashed on the glory shone and cried
improvident unmemoried
and fitfully and like a flame
the light of laughter went and came
proud in their careless transience moved
the changing faces that i loved




till suddenly and otherwhence
i looked upon your innocence
for lifted clear and still and strange
from the dark woven flow of change
under a vast and starless sky
i saw the immortal moment lie
one instant i an instant knew
as god knows all and it and you




i above time oh blind could see
in witless immortality
i saw the marble cup the tea




hung on the air an amber stream
i saw the fires unglittering gleam
the painted flame the frozen smoke
no more the flooding lamplight broke
on flying eyes and lips and hair
but lay but slept unbroken there
on stiller flesh and body breathless
and lips and laughter stayed and deathless
and words on which no silence grew
light was more alive than you




for suddenly and otherwhence
i looked on your magnificence
i saw the stillness and the light
and you august immortal white
holy and strange and every glint
posture and jest and thought and tint
freed from the mask of transiency
triumphant in eternity




dazed at length
human eyes grew mortal strength
wearied and time began to creep
change closed about me like a sleep
light glinted on the eyes i loved
the cup was filled the bodies moved
the drifting petal came to ground
the laughter chimed its perfect round
the broken syllable was ended
and i so certain and so friended
how could i cloud or how distress
the heaven of your unconsciousness
or shake at times sufficient spell
stammering of lights unutterable
the eternal holiness of you
the timeless end you never knew
the peace that lay the light that shone
you never knew that i had gone
a million miles away and stayed
a million years the laughter played
unbroken round me and the jest
flashed on and we that knew the best
down wonderful hours grew happier yet
i sang at heart and talked and eat
and lived from laugh to laugh i too
when you were there and you and you





in a flowered dell the lady venus stood
amazed with sorrow down the morning one
far golden horn in the gold of trees and sun
rang out and held and died she thought the wood
grew quieter wing and leaf and pool of light
forgot to dance dumb lay the unfalling stream
life one eternal instant rose in dream
clear out of time poised on a golden height




till a swift terror broke the abrupt hour
the gold waves purled amidst the green above her
and a bird sang with one sharptaken breath
by sunlit branches and unshaken flower
the immortal limbs flashed to the human lover
and the immortal eyes to look on death





the damned ship lurched and slithered quiet and quick
my cold gorge rose the long sea rolled i knew
i must think hard of something or be sick
and could think hard of only one thing you
you you alone could hold my fancy ever
and with you memories come sharp pain and dole
now theres a choice heartache or tortured liver
a seasick body or a yousick soul




do i forget you retchings twist and tie me
old meat good meals brown gobbets up i throw
do i remember acrid return and slimy
the sobs and slobber of a last years woe
and still the sick ship rolls tis hard i tell ye
to choose twixt love and nausea heart and belly





all night the ways of heaven were desolate
long roads across a gleaming empty sky
outcast and doomed and driven you and i
alone serene beyond all love or hate
terror or triumph were content to wait
we silent and allknowing suddenly
swept through the heaven lowcrouching from on high
one horseman downward to the earths low gate




oh perfect from the ultimate height of living
lightly we turned through wet woods blossomhung
into the open down the supernal roads
with plumes atossing purple flags far flung
rank upon rank unbridled unforgiving
thundered the black battalions of the gods





through my hearts palace thoughts unnumbered throng
and there most quiet and as a child most wise
highthroned you sit and gracious all day long
great hopes goldarmoured jester fantasies
and pilgrim dreams and little beggar sighs
bow to your benediction go their way
and the grave jewelled courtier memories
worship and love and tend you all the day




but when i sleep and all my thoughts go straying
when the high session of the day is ended
and darkness comes then with the waning light
by lilied maidens on your way attended
proud from the wonted throne superbly swaying
you like a queen pass out into the night





ah not now when desire burns and the wind calls and the suns of spring
lightfoot dance in the woods whisper of life woo me to wayfaring
ah not now should you come now when the road beckons and good friends call
where are songs to be sung fights to be fought yea and the best of all
love on myriad lips fairer than yours kisses you could not give
dearest why should i mourn whimper and whine i that have yet to live
sorrow will i forget tears for the best love on the lips of you
now when dawn in the blood wakes and the sun laughs up the eastern blue
ill forget and be glad only at length dear when the great day ends
when love dies with the last light and the last song has been sung and friends
all are perished and gloom strides on the heaven then as alone i lie
mid deaths gathering winds frightened and dumb sick for the past may i
feel you suddenly there cool at my brow then may i hear the peace
of your voice at the last whispering love calling ere all can cease
in the silence of death then may i see dimly and know a space
bending over me last light in the dark once as of old your face





here the flame that was ash shrine that was void lost in the haunted wood
i have tended and loved year upon year i in the solitude
waiting quiet and gladeyed in the dark knowing that once a gleam
glowed and went through the wood still i abode strong in a golden dream
unrecaptured for i i that had faith knew that a face would glance
one day white in the dim woods and a voice call and a radiance
fill the grove and the fire suddenly leap and in the heart of it
end of labouring you therefore i kept ready the altar lit
the flame burning apart face of my dreams vainly in vision white
gleaming down to me lo hopeless i rise now for about midnight
whispers grew through the wood suddenly strange cries in the boughs above
grated cries like a laugh silent and black then through the sacred grove
great birds flew as a dream troubling the leaves passing at length i knew
long expected and long loved that afar god of the dim wood you
somewhere lay as a child sleeping a child suddenly reft from mirth
white and wonderful yet white in your youth stretched upon foreign earth
god immortal and dead	therefore i go never to rest or win
peace and worship of you more and the dumb wood and the shrine therein





so light we were so right we were so fair faith shone
and the way was laid so certainly that when id gone
what dumb thing looked up at you was it something heard
or a sudden cry that meekly and without a word
you broke the faith and strangely weakly slipped apart
you gave in you the proud of heart unbowed of heart
was this friend the end of all that we could do
and have you found the best for you the rest for you
did you learn so suddenly and i not by
some whispered story that stole the glory from the sky
and ended all the splendid dream and made you go
so dully from the fight we know the light we know




o faithless the faith remains and i must pass
gay down the way and on alone under the grass
you wait the breeze moves in the trees and stirs and calls
and covers you with white petals with light petals
there it shall crumble frail and fair under the sun
o little heart your brittle heart till day be done
and the shadows gather falling light and white with dew
whisper and weep and creep to you good sleep to you





now god be thanked who has matched us with his hour
and caught our youth and wakened us from sleeping
with hand made sure clear eye and sharpened power
to turn as swimmers into cleanness leaping
glad from a world grown old and cold and weary
leave the sick hearts that honour could not move
and halfmen and their dirty songs and dreary
and all the little emptiness of love




oh we who have known shame we have found release there
where theres no ill no grief but sleep has mending
naught broken save this body lost but breath
nothing to shake the laughing hearts long peace there
but only agony and that has ending
and the worst friend and enemy is but death





dear of all happy in the hour most blest
he who has found our hid security
assured in the dark tides of the world that rest
and heard our word who is so safe as we
we have found safety with all things undying
the winds and morning tears of men and mirth
the deep night and birds singing and clouds flying
and sleep and freedom and the autumnal earth
we have built a house that is not for times throwing
we have gained a peace unshaken by pain for ever
war knows no power safe shall be my going
secretly armed against all deaths endeavour
safe though all safetys lost safe where men fall
and if these poor limbs die safest of all





blow out you bugles over the rich dead
theres none of these so lonely and poor of old
but dying has made us rarer gifts than gold
these laid the world away poured out the red
sweet wine of youth gave up the years to be
of work and joy and that unhoped serene
that men call age and those who would have been
their sons they gave their immortality




blow bugles blow they brought us for our dearth
holiness lacked so long and love and pain
honour has come back as a king to earth
and paid his subjects with a royal wage
and nobleness walks in our ways again
and we have come into our heritage





these hearts were woven of human joys and cares
washed marvellously with sorrow swift to mirth
the years had given them kindness dawn was theirs
and sunset and the colours of the earth
these had seen movement and heard music known
slumber and waking loved gone proudly friended
felt the quick stir of wonder sat alone
touched flowers and furs and cheeks all this is ended




there are waters blown by changing winds to laughter
and lit by the rich skies all day and after
frost with a gesture stays the waves that dance
and wandering loveliness he leaves a white
unbroken glory a gathered radiance
a width a shining peace under the night





if i should die think only this of me
that theres some corner of a foreign field
that is for ever england there shall be
in that rich earth a richer dust concealed
a dust whom england bore shaped made aware
gave once her flowers to love her ways to roam
a body of englands breathing english air
washed by the rivers blest by suns of home




and think this heart all evil shed away
a pulse in the eternal mind no less
gives somewhere back the thoughts by england given
her sights and sounds dreams happy as her day
and laughter learnt of friends and gentleness
in hearts at peace under an english heaven





when colour goes home into the eyes
and lights that shine are shut again
with dancing girls and sweet birds cries
behind the gateways of the brain
and that noplace which gave them birth shall close
the rainbow and the rose




still may time hold some golden space
where ill unpack that scented store
of song and flower and sky and face
and count and touch and turn them oer
musing upon them as a mother who
has watched her children all the rich day through
sits quiethanded in the fading light
when children sleep ere night





mamua when our laughter ends
and hearts and bodies brown as white
are dust about the doors of friends
or scent ablowing down the night
then oh then the wise agree
comes our immortality
mamua there waits a land
hard for us to understand




out of time beyond the sun
all are one in paradise
you and pupure are one
and tau and the ungainly wise
there the eternals are and there
the good the lovely and the true
and types whose earthly copies were
the foolish broken things we knew
there is the face whose ghosts we are
the real the neversetting star




and the flower of which we love
faint and fading shadows here
never a tear but only grief
dance but not the limbs that move
songs in song shall disappear
instead of lovers love shall be
for hearts immutability
and there on the ideal reef
thunders the everlasting sea




and my laughter and my pain
shall home to the eternal brain
and all lovely things they say
meet in loveliness again




miris laugh tepos feet
and the hands of matua
stars and sunlight there shall meet
corals hues and rainbows there
and teras braided hair




and with the starred tiares white
and white birds in the dark ravine
and flamboyants ablaze at night
and jewels and evenings aftergreen




and dawns of pearl and gold and red
mamua your lovelier head
and therell no more be one who dreams
under the ferns of crumbling stuff
eyes of illusion mouth that seems
all timeentangled human love




and youll no longer swing and sway
divinely down the scented shade
where feet to ambulation fade
and moons are lost in endless day
how shall we wind these wreaths of ours
where there are neither heads nor flowers
oh heavens heavenbut well be missing
the palms and sunlight and the south
and theres an end i think of kissing
when our mouths are one with mouth




ta here mamua
crown the hair and come away
hear the calling of the moon
and the whispering scents that stray
about the idle warm lagoon
hasten hand in human hand
down the dark the flowered way
along the whiteness of the sand
and in the waters soft caress
wash the mind of foolishness
mamua until the day




spend the glittering moonlight there
pursuing down the soundless deep
limbs that gleam and shadowy hair
or floating lazy halfasleep
dive and double and follow after
snare in flowers and kiss and call
with lips that fade and human laughter
and faces individual
well this side of paradise
theres little comfort in the wise





in your arms was still delight
quiet as a street at night
and thoughts of you i do remember
were green leaves in a darkened chamber
were dark clouds in a moonless sky
love in you went passing by
penetrative remote and rare
like a bird in the wide air
and as the bird it left no trace
in the heaven of your face
in your stupidity i found
the sweet hush after a sweet sound
all about you was the light
that dims the greying end of night
desire was the unrisen sun
joy the day not yet begun
with tree whispering to tree
without wind quietly
wisdom slept within your hair
and longsuffering was there
and in the flowing of your dress
undiscerning tenderness
and when you thought it seemed to me
infinitely and like a sea
about the slight world you had known
your vast unconsciousness was thrown




o haven without wave or tide
silence in which all songs have died
holy book where hearts are still
and home at length under the hill
o mother quiet breasts of peace
where love itself would faint and cease
o infinite deep i never knew
i would come back come back to you
find you as a pool unstirred
kneel down by you and never a word
lay my head and nothing said
in your hands ungarlanded
and a long watch you would keep
and i should sleep and i should sleep





i have been so great a lover filled my days
so proudly with the splendour of loves praise
the pain the calm and the astonishment
desire illimitable and still content
and all dear names men use to cheat despair
for the perplexed and viewless streams that bear
our hearts at random down the dark of life
now ere the unthinking silence on that strife
steals down i would cheat drowsy death so far
my night shall be remembered for a star
that outshone all the suns of all mens days
shall i not crown them with immortal praise
whom i have loved who have given me dared with me
high secrets and in darkness knelt to see
the inenarrable godhead of delight
love is a flame we have beaconed the worlds night
a city and we have built it these and i
an emperor we have taught the world to die
so for their sakes i loved ere i go hence
and the high cause of loves magnificence
and to keep loyalties young ill write those names
golden for ever eagles crying flames
and set them as a banner that men may know
to dare the generations burn and blow
out on the wind of time shining and streaming
these i have loved white plates and cups cleangleaming
ringed with blue lines and feathery faery dust
wet roofs beneath the lamplight the strong crust
of friendly bread and manytasting food
rainbows and the blue bitter smoke of wood
and radiant raindrops couching in cool flowers
and flowers themselves that sway through sunny hours
dreaming of moths that drink them under the moon
then the cool kindliness of sheets that soon
smooth away trouble and the rough male kiss
of blankets grainy wood live hair that is
shining and free bluemassing clouds the keen
unpassioned beauty of a great machine
the benison of hot water furs to touch
the good smell of old clothes and other such
the comfortable smell of friendly fingers
hairs fragrance and the musty reek that lingers
about dead leaves and last years ferns dear names
and thousand other throng to me royal flames
sweet waters dimpling laugh from tap or spring
holes in the ground and voices that do sing
voices in laughter too and bodys pain
soon turned to peace and the deeppanting train
firm sands the little dulling edge of foam
that browns and dwindles as the wave goes home
and washen stones gay for an hour the cold
graveness of iron moist black earthen mould
sleep and high places footprints in the dew
and oaks and brown horsechestnuts glossynew
and newpeeled sticks and shining pools on grass
all these have been my loves and these shall pass
whatever passes not in the great hour
nor all my passion all my prayers have power
to hold them with me through the gate of death
theyll play deserter turn with the traitor breath
break the high bond we made and sell loves trust
and sacramented covenant to the dust
oh never a doubt but somewhere i shall wake
and give whats left of love again and make
new friends now strangers but the best ive known
stays here and changes breaks grows old is blown
about the winds of the world and fades from brains
of living men and dies nothing remains
o dear my loves o faithless once again
this one last gift i give that after men
shall know and later lovers farremoved
praise you all these were lovely say he loved





fish flyreplete in depth of june
dawdling away their watry noon
ponder deep wisdom dark or clear
each secret fishy hope or fear
fish say they have their stream and pond
but is there anything beyond
this life cannot be all they swear
for how unpleasant if it were
one may not doubt that somehow good
shall come of water and of mud
and sure the reverent eye must see
a purpose in liquidity
we darkly know by faith we cry
the future is not wholly dry
mud unto mud death eddies near
not here the appointed end not here
but somewhere beyond space and time
is wetter water slimier slime
and there they trust there swimmeth one
who swam ere rivers were begun
immense of fishy form and mind
squamous omnipotent and kind
and under that almighty fin
the littlest fish may enter in
oh never fly conceals a hook
fish say in the eternal brook
but more than mundane weeds are there
and mud celestially fair
fat caterpillars drift around
and paradisal grubs are found
unfading moths immortal flies
and the worm that never dies
and in that heaven of all their wish
there shall be no more land say fish





when she sleeps her soul i know
goes a wanderer on the air
wings where i may never go
leaves her lying still and fair
waiting empty laid aside
like a dress upon a chair
this i know and yet i know
doubts that will not be denied




for if the soul be not in place
what has laid trouble in her face
and sits there nothing ware and wise
behind the curtains of her eyes
what is it in the selfs eclipse
shadows soft and passingly
about the corners of her lips
the smile that is essential she




and if the spirit be not there
why is fragrance in the hair





oh love is fair and love is rare my dear one she said
but love goes lightly over i bowed her foolish head
and kissed her hair and laughed at her such a child was she
so new to love so true to love and she spoke so bitterly




but theres wisdom in women of more than they have known
and thoughts go blowing through them are wiser than their own
or how should my dear one being ignorant and young
have cried on love so bitterly with so true a tongue





i have peace to weigh your worth now all is over
but if to praise or blame you cannot say
for who decries the loved decries the lover
yet what man lauds the thing hes thrown away




be you in truth this dull slight cloudy naught
the more fool i so great a fool to adore
but if youre that high goddess once i thought
the more your godhead is i lose the more




dear fool pity the fool who thought you clever
dear wisdom do not mock the fool that missed you
most fair the blind has lost your face for ever
most foul how could i see you while i kissed you




so the poor love of fools and blind ive proved you
for foul or lovely twas a fool that loved you





somewhile before the dawn i rose and stept
softly along the dim way to your room
and found you sleeping in the quiet gloom
and holiness about you as you slept
i knelt there till your waking fingers crept
about my head and held it i had rest
unhoped this side of heaven beneath your breast
i knelt a long time still nor even wept




it was great wrong you did me and for gain
of that poor moments kindliness and ease
and sleepy mothercomfort child you know
how easily love leaps out to dreams like these
who has seen them true and love thats wakened so
takes all too long to lay asleep again





today i have been happy all the day
i held the memory of you and wove
its laughter with the dancing light o the spray
and sowed the sky with tiny clouds of love
and sent you following the white waves of sea
and crowned your head with fancies nothing worth
stray buds from that old dust of misery
being glad with a new foolish quiet mirth




so lightly i played with those dark memories
just as a child beneath the summer skies
plays hour by hour with a strange shining stone
for which he knows not towns were fire of old
and love has been betrayed and murder done
and great kings turned to a little bitter mould





warm perfumes like a breath from vine and tree
drift down the darkness plangent hidden from eyes
somewhere an eukaleli thrills and cries
and stabs with pain the nights brown savagery
and dark scents whisper and dim waves creep to me
gleam like a womans hair stretch out and rise
and new stars burn into the ancient skies
over the murmurous soft hawaian sea




and i recall lose grasp forget again
and still remember a tale i have heard or known
an empty tale of idleness and pain
of two that loved or did not love and one
whose perplexed heart did evil foolishly
a long while since and by some other sea





in the grey tumult of these after years
oft silence falls the incessant wranglers part
and lessthanechoes of remembered tears
hush all the loud confusion of the heart
and a shade through the tossd ranks of mirth and crying
hungers and pains and each dull passionate mood
quite lost and all but all forgot undying
comes back the ecstasy of your quietude




so a poor ghost beside his misty streams
is haunted by strange doubts evasive dreams
hints of a prelethean life of men
stars rocks and flesh things unintelligible
and light on waving grass he knows not when
and feet that ran but where he cannot tell





not with vain tears when were beyond the sun
well beat on the substantial doors nor tread
those dusty highroads of the aimless dead
plaintive for earth but rather turn and run
down some closecovered byway of the air
some low sweet alley between wind and wind
stoop under faint gleams thread the shadows find
some whispering ghostforgotten nook and there




spend in pure converse our eternal day
think each in each immediately wise
learn all we lacked before hear know and say
what this tumultuous body now denies
and feel who have laid our groping hands away
and see no longer blinded by our eyes





down the blue night the unending columns press
in noiseless tumult break and wave and flow
now tread the far south or lift rounds of snow
up to the white moons hidden loveliness
some pause in their grave wandering comradeless
and turn with profound gesture vague and slow
as who would pray good for the world but know
their benediction empty as they bless




they say that the dead die not but remain
near to the rich heirs of their grief and mirth
i think they ride the calm midheaven as these
in wise majestic melancholy train
and watch the moon and the stillraging seas
and men coming and going on the earth





they say theres a high windless world and strange
out of the wash of days and temporal tide
where faith and good wisdom and truth abide
aeterna corpora subject to no change
there the sure suns of these pale shadows move
there stand the immortal ensigns of our war
our melting flesh fixed beauty there a star
and perishing hearts imperishable love




dear we know only that we sigh kiss smile
each kiss lasts but the kissing and grief goes over
love has no habitation but the heart
poor straws on the dark flood we catch awhile
cling and are borne into the night apart
the laugh dies with the lips love with the lover





now that weve done our best and worst and parted
i would fill my mind with thoughts that will not rend
o heart i do not dare go emptyhearted
ill think of love in books love without end
women with child content and old men sleeping
and wet strong ploughlands scarred for certain grain
and babes that weep and so forget their weeping
and the young heavens forgetful after rain
and evening hush broken by homing wings
and songs nobility and wisdom holy
that live we dead i would think of a thousand things
lovely and durable and taste them slowly
one after one like tasting a sweet food
i have need to busy my heart with quietude





love is a breach in the walls a broken gate
where that comes in that shall not go again
love sells the proud hearts citadel to fate
they have known shame who love unloved even then
when two mouths thirsty each for each find slaking
and agonys forgot and hushed the crying
of credulous hearts in heaven such are but taking
their own poor dreams within their arms and lying
each in his lonely night each with a ghost
some share that night but they know love grows colder
grows false and dull that was sweet lies at most
astonishment is no more in hand or shoulder
but darkens and dies out from kiss to kiss
all this is love and all love is but this





heart you are restless as a paper scrap
thats tossed down dusty pavements by the wind
saying she is most wise patient and kind
between the small hands folded in her lap
surely a shamed head may bow down at length
and find forgiveness where the shadows stir
about her lips and wisdom in her strength
peace in her peace come to her come to her




she will not care shell smile to see me come
so that i think all heaven in flower to fold me
shell give me all i ask kiss me and hold me
and open wide upon that holy air
the gates of peace and take my tiredness home
kinder than god but heart she will not care





your hands my dear adorable
your lips of tenderness
oh ive loved you faithfully and well
three years or a bit less
it wasnt a success




thank god thats done and ill take the road
quit of my youth and you
the roman road to wendover
by tring and lilley hoo
as a free man may do




for youth goes over the joys that fly
the tears that follow fast
and the dirtiest things we do must lie
forgotten at the last
even love goes past




whats left behind i shall not find
the splendour and the pain
the splash of sun the shouting wind
and the brave sting of rain
i may not meet again




but the years that take the best away
give something in the end
and a better friend than love have they
for none to mar or mend
that have themselves to friend




i shall desire and i shall find
the best of my desires
the autumn road the mellow wind
that soothes the darkening shires
and laughter and innfires




white mist about the black hedgerows
the slumbering midland plain
the silence where the clover grows
and the dead leaves in the lane
certainly these remain




and i shall find some girl perhaps
and a better one than you
with eyes as wise but kindlier
and lips as soft but true
and i daresay she will do





i came back late and tired last night
into my little room
to the long chair and the firelight
and comfortable gloom




but as i entered softly in
i saw a woman there
the line of neck and cheek and chin
the darkness of her hair
the form of one i did not know
sitting in my chair




i stood a moment fierce and still
watching her neck and hair
i made a step to her and saw
that there was no one there




it was some trick of the firelight
that made me see her there
it was a chance of shade and light
and the cushion in the chair




oh all you happy over the earth
that night how could i sleep
i lay and watched the lonely gloom
and watched the moonlight creep
from wall to basin round the room
all night i could not sleep





hands and lit faces eddy to a line
the dazed last minutes click the clamour dies
beyond the greatswung arc o the roof divine
night smokyscarvd with thousand coloured eyes




glares the imperious mystery of the way
thirsty for dark you feel the longlimbed train
throb stretch thrill motion slide pull out and sway
strain for the far pause draw to strength again




as a man caught by some great hour will rise
slowlimbed to meet the light or find his love
and breathing long with staring sightless eyes
hands out head back agape and silent move




sure as a flood smooth as a vast wind blowing
and gathering power and purpose as he goes
unstumbling unreluctant strong unknowing
borne by a will not his that lifts that grows




sweep out to darkness triumphing in his goal
out of the fire out of the little room
there is an end appointed o my soul
crimson and green the signals burn the gloom




is hung with steams farblowing livid streamers
lost into god as lights in light we fly
grown one with will enddrunken huddled dreamers
the white lights roar the sounds of the world die




and lips and laughter are forgotten things
speed sharpens grows into the night and on
the strength and splendour of our purpose swings
the lamps fade and the stars we are alone





all suddenly the wind comes soft
and spring is here again
and the hawthorn quickens with buds of green
and my heart with buds of pain




my heart all winter lay so numb
the earth so dead and frore
that i never thought the spring would come
or my heart wake any more




but winters broken and earth has woken
and the small birds cry again
and the hawthorn hedge puts forth its buds
and my heart puts forth its pain





when beauty and beauty meet
all naked fair to fair
the earth is cryingsweet
and scatteringbright the air
eddying dizzying closing round
with soft and drunken laughter
veiling all that may befall
after after




where beauty and beauty met
earths still atremble there
and winds are scented yet
and memorysoft the air
bosoming folding glints of light
and shreds of shadowy laughter
not the tears that fill the years
after after





the way that lovers use is this
they bow catch hands with never a word
and their lips meet and they do kiss
so i have heard




they queerly find some healing so
and strange attainment in the touch
there is a secret lovers know
i have read as much




and theirs no longer joy nor smart
changing or ending night or day
but mouth to mouth and heart on heart
so lovers say





young mary loitering once her garden way
felt a warm splendour grow in the april day
as wine that blushes water through and soon
out of the gold air of the afternoon
one knelt before her hair he had or fire
bound back above his ears with golden wire
baring the eager marble of his face
not mans nor womans was the immortal grace
rounding the limbs beneath that robe of white
and lighting the proud eyes with changeless light
incurious calm as his wings and fair
that presence filled the garden she stood there
saying what would you sir he told his word
blessed art thou of women half she heard
hands folded and face bowed half long had known
the message of that clear and holy tone
that fluttered hot sweet sobs about her heart
such serene tidings moved such human smart
her breath came quick as little flakes of snow
her hands crept up her breast she did but know
it was not hers she felt a trembling stir
within her body a will too strong for her
that held and filled and mastered all with eyes
closed and a thousand soft short broken sighs
she gave submission fearful meek and glad
she wished to speak under her breasts she had
such multitudinous burnings to and fro
and throbs not understood she did not know
if they were hurt or joy for her but only
that she was grown strange to herself half lonely
all wonderful filled full of pains to come
and thoughts she dare not think swift thoughts and dumb
human and quaint her own yet very far
divine dear terrible familiar
her heart was faint for telling to relate
her limbs sweet treachery her strange high estate
over and over whispering half revealing
weeping and so find kindness to her healing
twixt tears and laughter panic hurrying her
she raised her eyes to that fair messenger
he knelt unmoved immortal with his eyes
gazing beyond her calm to the calm skies
radiant untroubled in his wisdom kind
his sheaf of lilies stirred not in the wind
how should she pitiful with mortality
try the wide peace of that felicity
with ripples of her perplexed shaken heart
and hints of human ecstasy human smart
and whispers of the lonely weight she bore
and how her womb within was hers no more
and at length hers being tired she bowed her head
and said so be it the great wings were spread
showering glory on the fields and fire
the whole air singing bore him up and higher




unswerving unreluctant soon he shone
a gold speck in the gold skies then was gone
the air was colder and grey she stood alone





the day that youth had died
there came to his graveside
in decent mourning from the countrys ends
those scatterd friends




who had lived the boon companions of his prime
and laughed with him and sung with him and wasted
in feast and wine and manycrownd carouse
the days and nights and dawnings of the time
when youth kept open house
nor left untasted




aught of his high emprise and ventures dear
no quest of his unshard
all these with loitering feet and sad head bard
followed their old friends bier




folly went first
with muffled bells and coxcomb still reversd
and after trod the bearers hat in hand
laughter most hoarse and captain pride with tanned
and martial face all grim and fussy joy
who had to catch a train and lust poor snivelling boy
these bore the dear departed
behind them brokenhearted




came grief so noisy a widow that all said
had he but wed
her elder sister sorrow in her stead




and by her trying to soothe her all the time
the fatherless children colour tune and rhyme
the sweet lad rhyme ran alluncomprehending
then at the ways sad ending
round the raw grave they stayd old wisdom read
in mumbling tone the service for the dead




there stood romance
the furrowing tears had markd her rougd cheek
poor old conceit his wonder unassuaged
dead innocencys daughter ignorance
and shabby illdressd generosity
and argument too full of woe to speak
passion grown portly something middleaged
and friendshipnot a minute older she




impatience ever taking out his watch
faith who was deaf and had to lean to catch
old wisdoms endless drone
beauty was there
pale in her black dryeyed she stood alone
poor mazd imagination fancy wild
ardour the sunlight on his greying hair
contentment who had known youth as a child




and never seen him since and spring came too
dancing over the tombs and brought him flowers
she did not stay for long
and truth and grace and all the merry crew
the laughing winds and rivers and lithe hours
and hope the dewyeyed and sorrowing song




yes with much woe and mourning general
at dead youths funeral
even these were met once more together all
who erst the fair and living youth did know
all except only love love had died long ago





just now the lilac is in bloom
all before my little room
and in my flowerbeds i think
smile the carnation and the pink
and down the borders well i know
the poppy and the pansy blow
oh there the chestnuts summer through
beside the river make for you
a tunnel of green gloom and sleep
deeply above and green and deep
the stream mysterious glides beneath
green as a dream and deep as death
oh damn i know it and i know
how the may fields all golden show
and when the day is young and sweet
gild gloriously the bare feet
that run to bathe du lieber gott
here am i sweating sick and hot
and there the shadowed waters fresh
lean up to embrace the naked flesh
temperamentvoll german jews
drink beer aroundand there the dews
are soft beneath a morn of gold
here tulips bloom as they are told
unkempt about those hedges blows
an english unofficial rose
and there the unregulated sun
slopes down to rest when day is done
and wakes a vague unpunctual star
a slippered hesper and there are
meads towards haslingfield and coton
where das betretens not verboten




would i were
in grantchester in grantchester
some it may be can get in touch
with nature there or earth or such
and clever modern men have seen
a faun apeeping through the green
and felt the classics were not dead
to glimpse a naiads reedy head
or hear the goatfoot piping low
but these are things i do not know
i only know that you may lie
day long and watch the cambridge sky
and flowerlulled in sleepy grass
hear the cool lapse of hours pass
until the centuries blend and blur
in grantchester in grantchester
still in the dawnlit waters cool
his ghostly lordship swims his pool
and tries the strokes essays the tricks
long learnt on hellespont or styx
dan chaucer hears his river still
chatter beneath a phantom mill
tennyson notes with studious eye
how cambridge waters hurry by
and in that garden black and white
creep whispers through the grass all night
and spectral dance before the dawn
a hundred vicars down the lawn
curates long dust will come and go
on lissom clerical printless toe
and oft between the boughs is seen
the sly shade of a rural dean
till at a shiver in the skies
vanishing with satanic cries
the prim ecclesiastic rout
leaves but a startled sleeperout
grey heavens the first birds drowsy calls
the falling house that never falls




god i will pack and take a train
and get me to england once again
for englands the one land i know
where men with splendid hearts may go
and cambridgeshire of all england
the shire for men who understand
and of that district i prefer
the lovely hamlet grantchester
for cambridge people rarely smile
being urban squat and packed with guile
and royston men in the far south
are black and fierce and strange of mouth
at over they fling oaths at one
and worse than oaths at trumpington
and ditton girls are mean and dirty
and theres none in harston under thirty
and folks in shelford and those parts
have twisted lips and twisted hearts
and barton men make cockney rhymes
and cotons full of nameless crimes
and things are done youd not believe
at madingley on christmas eve
strong men have run for miles and miles
when one from cherry hinton smiles
strong men have blanched and shot their wives
rather than send them to st ives
strong men have cried like babes bydam
to hear what happened at babraham
but grantchester ah grantchester
theres peace and holy quiet there
great clouds along pacific skies
and men and women with straight eyes
lithe children lovelier than a dream
a bosky wood a slumbrous stream
and little kindly winds that creep
round twilight corners half asleep
in grantchester their skins are white
they bathe by day they bathe by night
the women there do all they ought
the men observe the rules of thought
they love the good they worship truth
they laugh uproariously in youth
and when they get to feeling old
they up and shoot themselves im told
ah god to see the branches stir
across the moon at grantchester
to smell the thrillingsweet and rotten
unforgettable unforgotten
riversmell and hear the breeze
sobbing in the little trees
say do the elmclumps greatly stand
still guardians of that holy land
the chestnuts shade in reverend dream
the yet unacademic stream
is dawn a secret shy and cold
anadyomene silvergold
and sunset still a golden sea
from haslingfield to madingley
and after ere the night is born
do hares come out about the corn
oh is the water sweet and cool
gentle and brown above the pool
and laughs the immortal river still
under the mill under the mill
say is there beauty yet to find
and certainty and quiet kind
deep meadows yet for to forget
the lies and truths and pain oh yet
stands the church clock at ten to three
and is there honey still for tea





stars that seem so close and bright
watched by lovers through the night
swim in emptiness men say
many a mile and year away

and yonder star that burns so white
may have died to dust and night
ten maybe or fifteen year
before it shines upon my dear

oh often among men below
heart cries out to heart i know
and one is dust a many years
child before the other hears

heart from heart is all as far
fafaia as start from star



bob southey youre a poet poet laureate
and representative of all the race
although tis true that you turned out a tory at
last yours has lately been a common case
and now my epic renegade what are ye at
with all the lakers in and out of place
a nest of tuneful persons to my eye
like four and twenty blackbirds in a pye


which pye being opened they began to sing
this old song and new simile holds good
a dainty dish to set before the king
or regent who admires such kind of food
and coleridge too has lately taken wing
but like a hawk encumbered with his hood
explaining metaphysics to the nation
i wish he would explain his explanation


you bob are rather insolent you know
at being disappointed in your wish
to supersede all warblers here below
and be the only blackbird in the dish
and then you overstrain yourself or so
and tumble downward like the flying fish
gasping on deck because you soar too high
bob and fall for lack of moisture quite a dry


and wordsworth in a rather long excursion
i think the quarto holds five hundred pages
has given a sample from the vasty version
of his new system to perplex the sages
tis poetry at least by his assertion
and may appear so when the dog star rages
and he who understands it would be able
to add a story to the tower of babel


you gentlemen by dint of long seclusion
from better company have kept your own
at keswick and through still continued fusion
of one anothers minds at last have grown
to deem as a most logical conclusion
that poesy has wreaths for you alone
there is a narrowness in such a notion
which makes me wish youd change your lakes for ocean


i would not imitate the petty thought
nor coin my selflove to so base a vice
for all the glory your conversion brought
since gold alone should not have been its price
you have your salary wast for that you wrought
and wordsworth has his place in the excise
youre shabby fellowstruebut poets still
and duly seated on the immortal hill


your bays may hide the baldness of your brows
perhaps some virtuous blushes let them go
to you i envy neither fruit nor boughs
and for the fame you would engross below
the field is universal and allows
scope to all such as feel the inherent glow
scott rogers campbell moore and crabbe will try
gainst you the question with posterity


for me who wandering with pedestrian muses
contend not with you on the winged steed
i wish your fate may yield ye when she chooses
the fame you envy and the skill you need
and recollect a poet nothing loses
in giving to his brethren their full meed
of merit and complaint of present days
is not the certain path to future praise


he that reserves his laurels for posterity
who does not often claim the bright reversion
has generally no great crop to spare it he
being only injured by his own assertion
and although here and there some glorious rarity
arise like titan from the seas immersion
the major part of such appellants go
togod knows wherefor no one else can know


if fallen in evil days on evil tongues
milton appealed to the avenger time
if time the avenger execrates his wrongs
and makes the word miltonic mean sublime
he deigned not to belie his soul in songs
nor turn his very talent to a crime
he did not loathe the sire to laud the son
but closed the tyranthater he begun


thinkst thou could he the blind old man arise
like samuel from the grave to freeze once more
the blood of monarchs with his prophecies
or be alive againagain all hoar
with time and trials and those helpless eyes
and heartless daughtersworn and pale and poor
would he adore a sultan he obey
the intellectual eunuch castlereagh


coldblooded smoothfaced placid miscreant
dabbling its sleek young hands in erins gore
and thus for wider carnage taught to pant
transferred to gorge upon a sister shore
the vulgarest tool that tyranny could want
with just enough of talent and no more
to lengthen fetters by another fixed
and offer poison long already mixed


an orator of such set trash of phrase
ineffably legitimately vile
that even its grossest flatterers dare not praise
nor foesall nationscondescend to smile
not even a sprightly blunders spark can blaze
from that ixion grindstones ceaseless toil
that turns and turns to give the world a notion
of endless torments and perpetual motion


a bungler even in its disgusting trade
and botching patching leaving still behind
something of which its masters are afraid
states to be curbed and thoughts to be confined
conspiracy or congress to be made
cobbling at manacles for all mankind
a tinkering slavemaker who mends old chains
with god and mans abhorrence for its gains


if we may judge of matter by the mind
emasculated to the marrow it
hath but two objects how to serve and bind
deeming the chain it wears even men may fit
eutropius of its many masters blind
to worth as freedom wisdom as to wit
fearless because no feeling dwells in ice
its very courage stagnates to a vice


where shall i turn me not to view its bonds
for i will never feel them italy
thy late reviving roman soul desponds
beneath the lie this statething breathed oer thee
thy clanking chain and erins yet green wounds
have voices tongues to cry aloud for me
europe has slaves allies kings armies still
and southey lives to sing them very ill


meantime sir laureate i proceed to dedicate
in honest simple verse this song to you
and if in flattering strains i do not predicate
tis that i still retain my buff and blue
my politics as yet are all to educate
apostasys so fashionable too
to keep one creeds a task grown quite
herculean is it not so my tory ultrajulian


i want a hero an uncommon want
when every year and month sends forth a new one
till after cloying the gazettes with cant
the age discovers he is not the true one
of such as these i should not care to vaunt
i ll therefore take our ancient friend don juan
we all have seen him in the pantomime
sent to the devil somewhat ere his time


vernon the butcher cumberland wolfe hawke
prince ferdinand granby burgoyne keppel howe
evil and good have had their tithe of talk
and filld their sign posts then like wellesley now
each in their turn like banquos monarchs stalk
followers of fame nine farrow of that sow
france too had buonaparte and dumourier
recorded in the moniteur and courier


barnave brissot condorcet mirabeau
petion clootz danton marat la fayette
were french and famous people as we know
and there were others scarce forgotten yet
joubert hoche marceau lannes desaix moreau
with many of the military set
exceedingly remarkable at times
but not at all adapted to my rhymes


nelson was once britannias god of war
and still should be so but the tide is turnd
there s no more to be said of trafalgar
t is with our hero quietly inurnd
because the army s grown more popular
at which the naval people are concernd
besides the prince is all for the landservice
forgetting duncan nelson howe and jervis


brave men were living before agamemnon
and since exceeding valorous and sage
a good deal like him too though quite the same none
but then they shone not on the poets page
and so have been forgotteni condemn none
but cant find any in the present age
fit for my poem that is for my new one
so as i said i ll take my friend don juan


most epic poets plunge in medias res
horace makes this the heroic turnpike road
and then your hero tells wheneer you please
what went beforeby way of episode
while seated after dinner at his ease
beside his mistress in some soft abode
palace or garden paradise or cavern
which serves the happy couple for a tavern


that is the usual method but not mine
my way is to begin with the beginning
the regularity of my design
forbids all wandering as the worst of sinning
and therefore i shall open with a line
although it cost me half an hour in spinning
narrating somewhat of don juans father
and also of his mother if you d rather


in seville was he born a pleasant city
famous for oranges and womenhe
who has not seen it will be much to pity
so says the proverband i quite agree
of all the spanish towns is none more pretty
cadiz perhapsbut that you soon may see
don juans parents lived beside the river
a noble stream and calld the guadalquivir


his fathers name was josedon of course
a true hidalgo free from every stain
of moor or hebrew blood he traced his source
through the most gothic gentlemen of spain
a better cavalier neer mounted horse
or being mounted eer got down again
than jose who begot our hero who
begotbut that s to comewell to renew


his mother was a learned lady famed
for every branch of every science known
in every christian language ever named
with virtues equalld by her wit alone
she made the cleverest people quite ashamed
and even the good with inward envy groan
finding themselves so very much exceeded
in their own way by all the things that she did


her memory was a mine she knew by heart
all calderon and greater part of lope
so that if any actor missd his part
she could have served him for the prompters copy
for her feinagles were an useless art
and he himself obliged to shut up shophe
could never make a memory so fine as
that which adornd the brain of donna inez


her favourite science was the mathematical
her noblest virtue was her magnanimity
her wit she sometimes tried at wit was attic all
her serious sayings darkend to sublimity
in short in all things she was fairly what i call
a prodigyher morning dress was dimity
her evening silk or in the summer muslin
and other stuffs with which i wont stay puzzling


she knew the latinthat is the lords prayer
and greekthe alphabeti m nearly sure
she read some french romances here and there
although her mode of speaking was not pure
for native spanish she had no great care
at least her conversation was obscure
her thoughts were theorems her words a problem
as if she deemd that mystery would ennoble em


some women use their tonguesshe lookd a lecture
each eye a sermon and her brow a homily
an allinall sufficient selfdirector
like the lamented late sir samuel romilly
the laws expounder and the states corrector
whose suicide was almost an anomaly
one sad example more that all is vanity
the jury brought their verdict in insanity


in short she was a walking calculation
miss edgeworths novels stepping from their covers
or mrs trimmers books on education
or coelebs wife set out in quest of lovers
moralitys prim personification
in which not envys self a flaw discovers
to others share let female errors fall
for she had not even onethe worst of all


o she was perfect past all parallel
of any modern female saints comparison
so far above the cunning powers of hell
her guardian angel had given up his garrison
even her minutest motions went as well
as those of the best timepiece made by harrison
in virtues nothing earthly could surpass her
save thine incomparable oil macassar


perfect she was but as perfection is
insipid in this naughty world of ours
where our first parents never learnd to kiss
till they were exiled from their earlier bowers
where all was peace and innocence and bliss
i wonder how they got through the twelve hours
don jose like a lineal son of eve
went plucking various fruit without her leave


he was a mortal of the careless kind
with no great love for learning or the learnd
who chose to go whereer he had a mind
and never dreamd his lady was concernd
the world as usual wickedly inclined
to see a kingdom or a house oerturnd
whisperd he had a mistress some said two
but for domestic quarrels one will do


now donna inez had with all her merit
a great opinion of her own good qualities
neglect indeed requires a saint to bear it
and such indeed she was in her moralities
but then she had a devil of a spirit
and sometimes mixd up fancies with realities
and let few opportunities escape
of getting her liege lord into a scrape


this was an easy matter with a man
oft in the wrong and never on his guard
and even the wisest do the best they can
have moments hours and days so unprepared
that you might brain them with their ladys fan
and sometimes ladies hit exceeding hard
and fans turn into falchions in fair hands
and why and wherefore no one understands


t is pity learned virgins ever wed
with persons of no sort of education
or gentlemen who though well born and bred
grow tired of scientific conversation
i dont choose to say much upon this head
i m a plain man and in a single station
butoh ye lords of ladies intellectual
inform us truly have they not henpeckd you all


don jose and his lady quarrelldwhy
not any of the many could divine
though several thousand people chose to try
t was surely no concern of theirs nor mine
i loathe that low vicecuriosity
but if there s anything in which i shine
t is in arranging all my friends affairs
not having of my own domestic cares


and so i interfered and with the best
intentions but their treatment was not kind
i think the foolish people were possessd
for neither of them could i ever find
although their porter afterwards confessd
but that s no matter and the worst s behind
for little juan oer me threw down stairs
a pail of housemaids water unawares


a little curlyheaded goodfornothing
and mischiefmaking monkey from his birth
his parents neer agreed except in doting
upon the most unquiet imp on earth
instead of quarrelling had they been but both in
their senses they d have sent young master forth
to school or had him soundly whippd at home
to teach him manners for the time to come


don jose and the donna inez led
for some time an unhappy sort of life
wishing each other not divorced but dead
they lived respectably as man and wife
their conduct was exceedingly wellbred
and gave no outward signs of inward strife
until at length the smotherd fire broke out
and put the business past all kind of doubt


for inez calld some druggists and physicians
and tried to prove her loving lord was mad
but as he had some lucid intermissions
she next decided he was only bad
yet when they askd her for her depositions
no sort of explanation could be had
save that her duty both to man and god
required this conductwhich seemd very odd


she kept a journal where his faults were noted
and opend certain trunks of books and letters
all which might if occasion served be quoted
and then she had all seville for abettors
besides her good old grandmother who doted
the hearers of her case became repeaters
then advocates inquisitors and judges
some for amusement others for old grudges


and then this best and weakest woman bore
with such serenity her husbands woes
just as the spartan ladies did of yore
who saw their spouses killd and nobly chose
never to say a word about them more
calmly she heard each calumny that rose
and saw his agonies with such sublimity
that all the world exclaimd what magnanimity


no doubt this patience when the world is damning us
is philosophic in our former friends
t is also pleasant to be deemd magnanimous
the more so in obtaining our own ends
and what the lawyers call a malus animus
conduct like this by no means comprehends
revenge in person s certainly no virtue
but then t is not my fault if others hurt you


and if your quarrels should rip up old stories
and help them with a lie or two additional
i m not to blame as you well knowno more is
any one elsethey were become traditional
besides their resurrection aids our glories
by contrast which is what we just were wishing all
and science profits by this resurrection
dead scandals form good subjects for dissection


their friends had tried at reconciliation
then their relations who made matters worse
t were hard to tell upon a like occasion
to whom it may be best to have recourse
i cant say much for friend or yet relation
the lawyers did their utmost for divorce
but scarce a fee was paid on either side
before unluckily don jose died


he died and most unluckily because
according to all hints i could collect
from counsel learned in those kinds of laws
although their talk s obscure and circumspect
his death contrived to spoil a charming cause
a thousand pities also with respect
to public feeling which on this occasion
was manifested in a great sensation


but ah he died and buried with him lay
the public feeling and the lawyers fees
his house was sold his servants sent away
a jew took one of his two mistresses
a priest the otherat least so they say
i askd the doctors after his disease
he died of the slow fever calld the tertian
and left his widow to her own aversion


yet jose was an honourable man
that i must say who knew him very well
therefore his frailties i ll no further scan
indeed there were not many more to tell
and if his passions now and then outran
discretion and were not so peaceable
as numas who was also named pompilius
he had been ill brought up and was born bilious


whateer might be his worthlessness or worth
poor fellow he had many things to wound him
let s ownsince it can do no good on earth
it was a trying moment that which found him
standing alone beside his desolate hearth
where all his household gods lay shiverd round him
no choice was left his feelings or his pride
save death or doctors commonsso he died


dying intestate juan was sole heir
to a chancery suit and messuages and lands
which with a long minority and care
promised to turn out well in proper hands
inez became sole guardian which was fair
and answerd but to natures just demands
an only son left with an only mother
is brought up much more wisely than another


sagest of women even of widows she
resolved that juan should be quite a paragon
and worthy of the noblest pedigree
his sire was of castile his dam from aragon
then for accomplishments of chivalry
in case our lord the king should go to war again
he learnd the arts of riding fencing gunnery
and how to scale a fortressor a nunnery


but that which donna inez most desired
and saw into herself each day before all
the learned tutors whom for him she hired
was that his breeding should be strictly moral
much into all his studies she inquired
and so they were submitted first to her all
arts sciences no branch was made a mystery
to juans eyes excepting natural history


the languages especially the dead
the sciences and most of all the abstruse
the arts at least all such as could be said
to be the most remote from common use
in all these he was much and deeply read
but not a page of any thing that s loose
or hints continuation of the species
was ever sufferd lest he should grow vicious


his classic studies made a little puzzle
because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses
who in the earlier ages raised a bustle
but never put on pantaloons or bodices
his reverend tutors had at times a tussle
and for their aeneids iliads and odysseys
were forced to make an odd sort of apology
for donna inez dreaded the mythology


ovid s a rake as half his verses show him
anacreons morals are a still worse sample
catullus scarcely has a decent poem
i dont think sapphos ode a good example
although longinus tells us there is no hymn
where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample
but virgils songs are pure except that horrid one
beginning with formosum pastor corydon


lucretius irreligion is too strong
for early stomachs to prove wholesome food
i cant help thinking juvenal was wrong
although no doubt his real intent was good
for speaking out so plainly in his song
so much indeed as to be downright rude
and then what proper person can be partial
to all those nauseous epigrams of martial


juan was taught from out the best edition
expurgated by learned men who place
judiciously from out the schoolboys vision
the grosser parts but fearful to deface
too much their modest bard by this omission
and pitying sore his mutilated case
they only add them all in an appendix
which saves in fact the trouble of an index


for there we have them all at one fell swoop
instead of being scatterd through the pages
they stand forth marshalld in a handsome troop
to meet the ingenuous youth of future ages
till some less rigid editor shall stoop
to call them back into their separate cages
instead of standing staring all together
like garden godsand not so decent either


the missal too it was the family missal
was ornamented in a sort of way
which ancient massbooks often are and this all
kinds of grotesques illumined and how they
who saw those figures on the margin kiss all
could turn their optics to the text and pray
is more than i knowbut don juans mother
kept this herself and gave her son another


sermons he read and lectures he endured
and homilies and lives of all the saints
to jerome and to chrysostom inured
he did not take such studies for restraints
but how faith is acquired and then ensured
so well not one of the aforesaid paints
as saint augustine in his fine confessions
which make the reader envy his transgressions


this too was a seald book to little juan
i cant but say that his mamma was right
if such an education was the true one
she scarcely trusted him from out her sight
her maids were old and if she took a new one
you might be sure she was a perfect fright
she did this during even her husbands life
i recommend as much to every wife


young juan waxd in goodliness and grace
at six a charming child and at eleven
with all the promise of as fine a face
as eer to mans maturer growth was given
he studied steadily and grew apace
and seemd at least in the right road to heaven
for half his days were passd at church the other
between his tutors confessor and mother


at six i said he was a charming child
at twelve he was a fine but quiet boy
although in infancy a little wild
they tamed him down amongst them to destroy
his natural spirit not in vain they toild
at least it seemd so and his mothers joy
was to declare how sage and still and steady
her young philosopher was grown already


i had my doubts perhaps i have them still
but what i say is neither here nor there
i knew his father well and have some skill
in characterbut it would not be fair
from sire to son to augur good or ill
he and his wife were an illsorted pair
but scandal s my aversioni protest
against all evil speaking even in jest


for my part i say nothingnothingbut
this i will saymy reasons are my own
that if i had an only son to put
to school as god be praised that i have none
t is not with donna inez i would shut
him up to learn his catechism alone
nonoi d send him out betimes to college
for there it was i pickd up my own knowledge


for there one learnst is not for me to boast
though i acquiredbut i pass over that
as well as all the greek i since have lost
i say that there s the placebut verbum sat
i think i pickd up too as well as most
knowledge of mattersbut no matter what
i never marriedbut i think i know
that sons should not be educated so


young juan now was sixteen years of age
tall handsome slender but well knit he seemd
active though not so sprightly as a page
and everybody but his mother deemd
him almost man but she flew in a rage
and bit her lips for else she might have screamd
if any said so for to be precocious
was in her eyes a thing the most atrocious


amongst her numerous acquaintance all
selected for discretion and devotion
there was the donna julia whom to call
pretty were but to give a feeble notion
of many charms in her as natural
as sweetness to the flower or salt to ocean
her zone to venus or his bow to cupid
but this last simile is trite and stupid


the darkness of her oriental eye
accorded with her moorish origin
her blood was not all spanish by the by
in spain you know this is a sort of sin
when proud granada fell and forced to fly
boabdil wept of donna julias kin
some went to africa some stayd in spain
her greatgreatgrandmamma chose to remain


she married i forget the pedigree
with an hidalgo who transmitted down
his blood less noble than such blood should be
at such alliances his sires would frown
in that point so precise in each degree
that they bred in and in as might be shown
marrying their cousinsnay their aunts and nieces
which always spoils the breed if it increases


this heathenish cross restored the breed again
ruind its blood but much improved its flesh
for from a root the ugliest in old spain
sprung up a branch as beautiful as fresh
the sons no more were short the daughters plain
but there s a rumour which i fain would hush
t is said that donna julias grandmamma
produced her don more heirs at love than law


however this might be the race went on
improving still through every generation
until it centred in an only son
who left an only daughter my narration
may have suggested that this single one
could be but julia whom on this occasion
i shall have much to speak about and she
was married charming chaste and twentythree


her eye i m very fond of handsome eyes
was large and dark suppressing half its fire
until she spoke then through its soft disguise
flashd an expression more of pride than ire
and love than either and there would arise
a something in them which was not desire
but would have been perhaps but for the soul
which struggled through and chastend down the whole


her glossy hair was clusterd oer a brow
bright with intelligence and fair and smooth
her eyebrows shape was like th aerial bow
her cheek all purple with the beam of youth
mounting at times to a transparent glow
as if her veins ran lightning she in sooth
possessd an air and grace by no means common
her stature talli hate a dumpy woman


wedded she was some years and to a man
of fifty and such husbands are in plenty
and yet i think instead of such a one
t were better to have two of fiveandtwenty
especially in countries near the sun
and now i think on t mi vien in mente
ladies even of the most uneasy virtue
prefer a spouse whose age is short of thirty


t is a sad thing i cannot choose but say
and all the fault of that indecent sun
who cannot leave alone our helpless clay
but will keep baking broiling burning on
that howsoever people fast and pray
the flesh is frail and so the soul undone
what men call gallantry and gods adultery
is much more common where the climate s sultry


happy the nations of the moral north
where all is virtue and the winter season
sends sin without a rag on shivering forth
t was snow that brought st anthony to reason
where juries cast up what a wife is worth
by laying whateer sum in mulct they please on
the lover who must pay a handsome price
because it is a marketable vice


alfonso was the name of julias lord
a man well looking for his years and who
was neither much beloved nor yet abhorrd
they lived together as most people do
suffering each others foibles by accord
and not exactly either one or two
yet he was jealous though he did not show it
for jealousy dislikes the world to know it


julia wasyet i never could see why
with donna inez quite a favourite friend
between their tastes there was small sympathy
for not a line had julia ever pennd
some people whisper but no doubt they lie
for malice still imputes some private end
that inez had ere don alfonsos marriage
forgot with him her very prudent carriage


and that still keeping up the old connection
which time had lately renderd much more chaste
she took his lady also in affection
and certainly this course was much the best
she flatterd julia with her sage protection
and complimented don alfonsos taste
and if she could not who can silence scandal
at least she left it a more slender handle


i cant tell whether julia saw the affair
with other peoples eyes or if her own
discoveries made but none could be aware
of this at least no symptom eer was shown
perhaps she did not know or did not care
indifferent from the first or callous grown
i m really puzzled what to think or say
she kept her counsel in so close a way


juan she saw and as a pretty child
caressd him oftensuch a thing might be
quite innocently done and harmless styled
when she had twenty years and thirteen he
but i am not so sure i should have smiled
when he was sixteen julia twentythree
these few short years make wondrous alterations
particularly amongst sunburnt nations


whateer the cause might be they had become
changed for the dame grew distant the youth shy
their looks cast down their greetings almost dumb
and much embarrassment in either eye
there surely will be little doubt with some
that donna julia knew the reason why
but as for juan he had no more notion
than he who never saw the sea of ocean


yet julias very coldness still was kind
and tremulously gentle her small hand
withdrew itself from his but left behind
a little pressure thrilling and so bland
and slight so very slight that to the mind
t was but a doubt but neer magicians wand
wrought change with all armidas fairy art
like what this light touch left on juans heart


and if she met him though she smiled no more
she lookd a sadness sweeter than her smile
as if her heart had deeper thoughts in store
she must not own but cherishd more the while
for that compression in its burning core
even innocence itself has many a wile
and will not dare to trust itself with truth
and love is taught hypocrisy from youth


but passion most dissembles yet betrays
even by its darkness as the blackest sky
foretells the heaviest tempest it displays
its workings through the vainly guarded eye
and in whatever aspect it arrays
itself t is still the same hypocrisy
coldness or anger even disdain or hate
are masks it often wears and still too late


then there were sighs the deeper for suppression
and stolen glances sweeter for the theft
and burning blushes though for no transgression
tremblings when met and restlessness when left
all these are little preludes to possession
of which young passion cannot be bereft
and merely tend to show how greatly love is
embarrassd at first starting with a novice


poor julias heart was in an awkward state
she felt it going and resolved to make
the noblest efforts for herself and mate
for honours prides religions virtues sake
her resolutions were most truly great
and almost might have made a tarquin quake
she prayd the virgin mary for her grace
as being the best judge of a ladys case


she vowd she never would see juan more
and next day paid a visit to his mother
and lookd extremely at the opening door
which by the virgins grace let in another
grateful she was and yet a little sore
again it opens it can be no other
t is surely juan nowno i m afraid
that night the virgin was no further prayd


she now determined that a virtuous woman
should rather face and overcome temptation
that flight was base and dastardly and no man
should ever give her heart the least sensation
that is to say a thought beyond the common
preference that we must feel upon occasion
for people who are pleasanter than others
but then they only seem so many brothers


and even if by chanceand who can tell
the devil s so very slyshe should discover
that all within was not so very well
and if still free that such or such a lover
might please perhaps a virtuous wife can quell
such thoughts and be the better when they re over
and if the man should ask t is but denial
i recommend young ladies to make trial


and then there are such things as love divine
bright and immaculate unmixd and pure
such as the angels think so very fine
and matrons who would be no less secure
platonic perfect just such love as mine
thus julia saidand thought so to be sure
and so i d have her think were i the man
on whom her reveries celestial ran


such love is innocent and may exist
between young persons without any danger
a hand may first and then a lip be kist
for my part to such doings i m a stranger
but hear these freedoms form the utmost list
of all oer which such love may be a ranger
if people go beyond t is quite a crime
but not my faulti tell them all in time


love then but love within its proper limits
was julias innocent determination
in young don juans favour and to him its
exertion might be useful on occasion
and lighted at too pure a shrine to dim its
ethereal lustre with what sweet persuasion
he might be taught by love and her together
i really dont know what nor julia either


fraught with this fine intention and well fenced
in mail of proofher purity of soul
she for the future of her strength convinced
and that her honour was a rock or mole
exceeding sagely from that hour dispensed
with any kind of troublesome control
but whether julia to the task was equal
is that which must be mentiond in the sequel


her plan she deemd both innocent and feasible
and surely with a stripling of sixteen
not scandals fangs could fix on much that s seizable
or if they did so satisfied to mean
nothing but what was good her breast was peaceable
a quiet conscience makes one so serene
christians have burnt each other quite persuaded
that all the apostles would have done as they did


and if in the mean time her husband died
but heaven forbid that such a thought should cross
her brain though in a dream and then she sighd
never could she survive that common loss
but just suppose that moment should betide
i only say suppose itinter nos
this should be entre nous for julia thought
in french but then the rhyme would go for naught


i only say suppose this supposition
juan being then grown up to mans estate
would fully suit a widow of condition
even seven years hence it would not be too late
and in the interim to pursue this vision
the mischief after all could not be great
for he would learn the rudiments of love
i mean the seraph way of those above


so much for julia now we ll turn to juan
poor little fellow he had no idea
of his own case and never hit the true one
in feelings quick as ovids miss medea
he puzzled over what he found a new one
but not as yet imagined it could be
thing quite in course and not at all alarming
which with a little patience might grow charming


silent and pensive idle restless slow
his home deserted for the lonely wood
tormented with a wound he could not know
his like all deep grief plunged in solitude
i m fond myself of solitude or so
but then i beg it may be understood
by solitude i mean a sultans not
a hermits with a haram for a grot


oh love in such a wilderness as this
where transport and security entwine
here is the empire of thy perfect bliss
and here thou art a god indeed divine
the bard i quote from does not sing amiss
with the exception of the second line
for that same twining transport and security
are twisted to a phrase of some obscurity


the poet meant no doubt and thus appeals
to the good sense and senses of mankind
the very thing which every body feels
as all have found on trial or may find
that no one likes to be disturbd at meals
or lovei wont say more about entwined
or transport as we knew all that before
but beg security will bolt the door


young juan wanderd by the glassy brooks
thinking unutterable things he threw
himself at length within the leafy nooks
where the wild branch of the cork forest grew
there poets find materials for their books
and every now and then we read them through
so that their plan and prosody are eligible
unless like wordsworth they prove unintelligible


he juan and not wordsworth so pursued
his selfcommunion with his own high soul
until his mighty heart in its great mood
had mitigated part though not the whole
of its disease he did the best he could
with things not very subject to control
and turnd without perceiving his condition
like coleridge into a metaphysician


he thought about himself and the whole earth
of man the wonderful and of the stars
and how the deuce they ever could have birth
and then he thought of earthquakes and of wars
how many miles the moon might have in girth
of airballoons and of the many bars
to perfect knowledge of the boundless skies
and then he thought of donna julias eyes


in thoughts like these true wisdom may discern
longings sublime and aspirations high
which some are born with but the most part learn
to plague themselves withal they know not why
t was strange that one so young should thus concern
his brain about the action of the sky
if you think t was philosophy that this did
i cant help thinking puberty assisted


he pored upon the leaves and on the flowers
and heard a voice in all the winds and then
he thought of woodnymphs and immortal bowers
and how the goddesses came down to men
he missd the pathway he forgot the hours
and when he lookd upon his watch again
he found how much old time had been a winner
he also found that he had lost his dinner


sometimes he turnd to gaze upon his book
boscan or garcilassoby the wind
even as the page is rustled while we look
so by the poesy of his own mind
over the mystic leaf his soul was shook
as if t were one whereon magicians bind
their spells and give them to the passing gale
according to some good old womans tale


thus would he while his lonely hours away
dissatisfied nor knowing what he wanted
nor glowing reverie nor poets lay
could yield his spirit that for which it panted
a bosom whereon he his head might lay
and hear the heart beat with the love it granted
withseveral other things which i forget
or which at least i need not mention yet


those lonely walks and lengthening reveries
could not escape the gentle julias eyes
she saw that juan was not at his ease
but that which chiefly may and must surprise
is that the donna inez did not tease
her only son with question or surmise
whether it was she did not see or would not
or like all very clever people could not


this may seem strange but yet t is very common
for instancegentlemen whose ladies take
leave to oerstep the written rights of woman
and break thewhich commandment is t they break
i have forgot the number and think no man
should rashly quote for fear of a mistake
i say when these same gentlemen are jealous
they make some blunder which their ladies tell us


a real husband always is suspicious
but still no less suspects in the wrong place
jealous of some one who had no such wishes
or pandering blindly to his own disgrace
by harbouring some dear friend extremely vicious
the last indeed s infallibly the case
and when the spouse and friend are gone off wholly
he wonders at their vice and not his folly


thus parents also are at times shortsighted
though watchful as the lynx they neer discover
the while the wicked world beholds delighted
young hopefuls mistress or miss fannys lover
till some confounded escapade has blighted
the plan of twenty years and all is over
and then the mother cries the father swears
and wonders why the devil he got heirs


but inez was so anxious and so clear
of sight that i must think on this occasion
she had some other motive much more near
for leaving juan to this new temptation
but what that motive was i shant say here
perhaps to finish juans education
perhaps to open don alfonsos eyes
in case he thought his wife too great a prize


it was upon a day a summers day
summers indeed a very dangerous season
and so is spring about the end of may
the sun no doubt is the prevailing reason
but whatsoeer the cause is one may say
and stand convicted of more truth than treason
that there are months which nature grows more merry in
march has its hares and may must have its heroine


t was on a summers daythe sixth of june
i like to be particular in dates
not only of the age and year but moon
they are a sort of posthouse where the fates
change horses making history change its tune
then spur away oer empires and oer states
leaving at last not much besides chronology
excepting the postobits of theology


t was on the sixth of june about the hour
of halfpast sixperhaps still nearer seven
when julia sate within as pretty a bower
as eer held houri in that heathenish heaven
described by mahomet and anacreon moore
to whom the lyre and laurels have been given
with all the trophies of triumphant song
he won them well and may he wear them long


she sate but not alone i know not well
how this same interview had taken place
and even if i knew i should not tell
people should hold their tongues in any case
no matter how or why the thing befell
but there were she and juan face to face
when two such faces are so t would be wise
but very difficult to shut their eyes


how beautiful she lookd her conscious heart
glowd in her cheek and yet she felt no wrong
o love how perfect is thy mystic art
strengthening the weak and trampling on the strong
how selfdeceitful is the sagest part
of mortals whom thy lure hath led along
the precipice she stood on was immense
so was her creed in her own innocence


she thought of her own strength and juans youth
and of the folly of all prudish fears
victorious virtue and domestic truth
and then of don alfonsos fifty years
i wish these last had not occurrd in sooth
because that number rarely much endears
and through all climes the snowy and the sunny
sounds ill in love whateer it may in money


when people say ive told you fifty times
they mean to scold and very often do
when poets say ive written fifty rhymes
they make you dread that they ll recite them too
in gangs of fifty thieves commit their crimes
at fifty love for love is rare t is true
but then no doubt it equally as true is
a good deal may be bought for fifty louis


julia had honour virtue truth and love
for don alfonso and she inly swore
by all the vows below to powers above
she never would disgrace the ring she wore
nor leave a wish which wisdom might reprove
and while she ponderd this besides much more
one hand on juans carelessly was thrown
quite by mistakeshe thought it was her own


unconsciously she leand upon the other
which playd within the tangles of her hair
and to contend with thoughts she could not smother
she seemd by the distraction of her air
t was surely very wrong in juans mother
to leave together this imprudent pair
she who for many years had watchd her son so
i m very certain mine would not have done so


the hand which still held juans by degrees
gently but palpably confirmd its grasp
as if it said detain me if you please
yet there s no doubt she only meant to clasp
his fingers with a pure platonic squeeze
she would have shrunk as from a toad or asp
had she imagined such a thing could rouse
a feeling dangerous to a prudent spouse


i cannot know what juan thought of this
but what he did is much what you would do
his young lip thankd it with a grateful kiss
and then abashd at its own joy withdrew
in deep despair lest he had done amiss
love is so very timid when t is new
she blushd and frownd not but she strove to speak
and held her tongue her voice was grown so weak


the sun set and up rose the yellow moon
the devil s in the moon for mischief they
who calld her chaste methinks began too soon
their nomenclature there is not a day
the longest not the twentyfirst of june
sees half the business in a wicked way
on which three single hours of moonshine smile
and then she looks so modest all the while


there is a dangerous silence in that hour
a stillness which leaves room for the full soul
to open all itself without the power
of calling wholly back its selfcontrol
the silver light which hallowing tree and tower
sheds beauty and deep softness oer the whole
breathes also to the heart and oer it throws
a loving languor which is not repose


and julia sate with juan half embraced
and half retiring from the glowing arm
which trembled like the bosom where t was placed
yet still she must have thought there was no harm
or else t were easy to withdraw her waist
but then the situation had its charm
and thengod knows what nexti cant go on
i m almost sorry that i eer begun


o plato plato you have paved the way
with your confounded fantasies to more
immoral conduct by the fancied sway
your system feigns oer the controulless core
of human hearts than all the long array
of poets and romancersyou re a bore
a charlatan a coxcomband have been
at best no better than a gobetween


and julias voice was lost except in sighs
until too late for useful conversation
the tears were gushing from her gentle eyes
i wish indeed they had not had occasion
but who alas can love and then be wise
not that remorse did not oppose temptation
a little still she strove and much repented
and whispering i will neer consentconsented


t is said that xerxes offerd a reward
to those who could invent him a new pleasure
methinks the requisition s rather hard
and must have cost his majesty a treasure
for my part i m a moderateminded bard
fond of a little love which i call leisure
i care not for new pleasures as the old
are quite enough for me so they but hold


o pleasure you are indeed a pleasant thing
although one must be damnd for you no doubt
i make a resolution every spring
of reformation ere the year run out
but somehow this my vestal vow takes wing
yet still i trust it may be kept throughout
i m very sorry very much ashamed
and mean next winter to be quite reclaimd


here my chaste muse a liberty must take
start not still chaster readershe ll be nice hence
forward and there is no great cause to quake
this liberty is a poetic licence
which some irregularity may make
in the design and as i have a high sense
of aristotle and the rules t is fit
to beg his pardon when i err a bit


this licence is to hope the reader will
suppose from june the sixth the fatal day
without whose epoch my poetic skill
for want of facts would all be thrown away
but keeping julia and don juan still
in sight that several months have passd we ll say
t was in november but i m not so sure
about the daythe era s more obscure


we ll talk of that anont is sweet to hear
at midnight on the blue and moonlit deep
the song and oar of adrias gondolier
by distance mellowd oer the waters sweep
t is sweet to see the evening star appear
t is sweet to listen as the nightwinds creep
from leaf to leaf t is sweet to view on high
the rainbow based on ocean span the sky


t is sweet to hear the watchdogs honest bark
bay deepmouthd welcome as we draw near home
t is sweet to know there is an eye will mark
our coming and look brighter when we come
t is sweet to be awakend by the lark
or lulld by falling waters sweet the hum
of bees the voice of girls the song of birds
the lisp of children and their earliest words


sweet is the vintage when the showering grapes
in bacchanal profusion reel to earth
purple and gushing sweet are our escapes
from civic revelry to rural mirth
sweet to the miser are his glittering heaps
sweet to the father is his firstborns birth
sweet is revengeespecially to women
pillage to soldiers prizemoney to seamen


sweet is a legacy and passing sweet
the unexpected death of some old lady
or gentleman of seventy years complete
who ve made us youth wait tootoo long already
for an estate or cash or country seat
still breaking but with stamina so steady
that all the israelites are fit to mob its
next owner for their doubledamnd postobits


t is sweet to win no matter how ones laurels
by blood or ink t is sweet to put an end
to strife t is sometimes sweet to have our quarrels
particularly with a tiresome friend
sweet is old wine in bottles ale in barrels
dear is the helpless creature we defend
against the world and dear the schoolboy spot
we neer forget though there we are forgot


but sweeter still than this than these than all
is first and passionate loveit stands alone
like adams recollection of his fall
the tree of knowledge has been pluckdall s known
and life yields nothing further to recall
worthy of this ambrosial sin so shown
no doubt in fable as the unforgiven
fire which prometheus filchd for us from heaven


man s a strange animal and makes strange use
of his own nature and the various arts
and likes particularly to produce
some new experiment to show his parts
this is the age of oddities let loose
where different talents find their different marts
you d best begin with truth and when you ve lost your
labour there s a sure market for imposture


what opposite discoveries we have seen
signs of true genius and of empty pockets
one makes new noses one a guillotine
one breaks your bones one sets them in their sockets
but vaccination certainly has been
a kind antithesis to congreves rockets
with which the doctor paid off an old pox
by borrowing a new one from an ox


bread has been made indifferent from potatoes
and galvanism has set some corpses grinning
but has not answerd like the apparatus
of the humane societys beginning
by which men are unsuffocated gratis
what wondrous new machines have late been spinning
i said the smallpox has gone out of late
perhaps it may be followd by the great


t is said the great came from america
perhaps it may set out on its return
the population there so spreads they say
t is grown high time to thin it in its turn
with war or plague or famine any way
so that civilisation they may learn
and which in ravage the more loathsome evil is
their real lues or our pseudosyphilis


this is the patentage of new inventions
for killing bodies and for saving souls
all propagated with the best intentions
sir humphry davys lantern by which coals
are safely mined for in the mode he mentions
tombuctoo travels voyages to the poles
are ways to benefit mankind as true
perhaps as shooting them at waterloo


man s a phenomenon one knows not what
and wonderful beyond all wondrous measure
t is pity though in this sublime world that
pleasure s a sin and sometimes sin s a pleasure
few mortals know what end they would be at
but whether glory power or love or treasure
the path is through perplexing ways and when
the goal is gaind we die you knowand then


what theni do not know no more do you
and so good nightreturn we to our story
t was in november when fine days are few
and the far mountains wax a little hoary
and clap a white cape on their mantles blue
and the sea dashes round the promontory
and the loud breaker boils against the rock
and sober suns must set at five oclock


t was as the watchmen say a cloudy night
no moon no stars the wind was low or loud
by gusts and many a sparkling hearth was bright
with the piled wood round which the family crowd
there s something cheerful in that sort of light
even as a summer sky s without a cloud
i m fond of fire and crickets and all that
a lobster salad and champagne and chat


t was midnightdonna julia was in bed
sleeping most probablywhen at her door
arose a clatter might awake the dead
if they had never been awoke before
and that they have been so we all have read
and are to be so at the least once more
the door was fastend but with voice and fist
first knocks were heard then madammadamhist


for gods sake madammadamhere s my master
with more than half the city at his back
was ever heard of such a curst disaster
t is not my faulti kept good watchalack
do pray undo the bolt a little faster
they re on the stair just now and in a crack
will all be here perhaps he yet may fly
surely the window s not so very high


by this time don alfonso was arrived
with torches friends and servants in great number
the major part of them had long been wived
and therefore paused not to disturb the slumber
of any wicked woman who contrived
by stealth her husbands temples to encumber
examples of this kind are so contagious
were one not punishd all would be outrageous


i cant tell how or why or what suspicion
could enter into don alfonsos head
but for a cavalier of his condition
it surely was exceedingly illbred
without a word of previous admonition
to hold a levee round his ladys bed
and summon lackeys armd with fire and sword
to prove himself the thing he most abhorrd


poor donna julia starting as from sleep
mindthat i do not sayshe had not slept
began at once to scream and yawn and weep
her maid antonia who was an adept
contrived to fling the bedclothes in a heap
as if she had just now from out them crept
i cant tell why she should take all this trouble
to prove her mistress had been sleeping double


but julia mistress and antonia maid
appeard like two poor harmless women who
of goblins but still more of men afraid
had thought one man might be deterrd by two
and therefore side by side were gently laid
until the hours of absence should run through
and truant husband should return and say
my dear i was the first who came away


now julia found at length a voice and cried
in heavens name don alfonso what d ye mean
has madness seized you would that i had died
ere such a monsters victim i had been
what may this midnight violence betide
a sudden fit of drunkenness or spleen
dare you suspect me whom the thought would kill
search then the roomalfonso said i will


he searchd they searchd and rummaged everywhere
closet and clothes press chest and windowseat
and found much linen lace and several pair
of stockings slippers brushes combs complete
with other articles of ladies fair
to keep them beautiful or leave them neat
arras they prickd and curtains with their swords
and wounded several shutters and some boards


under the bed they searchd and there they found
no matter whatit was not that they sought
they opend windows gazing if the ground
had signs or footmarks but the earth said nought
and then they stared each others faces round
t is odd not one of all these seekers thought
and seems to me almost a sort of blunder
of looking in the bed as well as under


during this inquisition julias tongue
was not asleepyes search and search she cried
insult on insult heap and wrong on wrong
it was for this that i became a bride
for this in silence i have sufferd long
a husband like alfonso at my side
but now i ll bear no more nor here remain
if there be law or lawyers in all spain


yes don alfonso husband now no more
if ever you indeed deserved the name
is t worthy of your yearsyou have threescore
fifty or sixty it is all the same
is t wise or fitting causeless to explore
for facts against a virtuous womans fame
ungrateful perjured barbarous don alfonso
how dare you think your lady would go on so


is it for this i have disdaind to hold
the common privileges of my sex
that i have chosen a confessor so old
and deaf that any other it would vex
and never once he has had cause to scold
but found my very innocence perplex
so much he always doubted i was married
how sorry you will be when i ve miscarried


was it for this that no cortejo eer
i yet have chosen from out the youth of seville
is it for this i scarce went anywhere
except to bullfights mass play rout and revel
is it for this whateer my suitors were
i favord nonenay was almost uncivil
is it for this that general count oreilly
who took algiers declares i used him vilely


did not the italian musico cazzani
sing at my heart six months at least in vain
did not his countryman count corniani
call me the only virtuous wife in spain
were there not also russians english many
the count strongstroganoff i put in pain
and lord mount coffeehouse the irish peer
who killd himself for love with wine last year


have i not had two bishops at my feet
the duke of ichar and don fernan nunez
and is it thus a faithful wife you treat
i wonder in what quarter now the moon is
i praise your vast forbearance not to beat
me also since the time so opportune is
o valiant man with sword drawn and cockd trigger
now tell me dont you cut a pretty figure


was it for this you took your sudden journey
under pretence of business indispensable
with that sublime of rascals your attorney
whom i see standing there and looking sensible
of having playd the fool though both i spurn he
deserves the worst his conduct s less defensible
because no doubt t was for his dirty fee
and not from any love to you nor me


if he comes here to take a deposition
by all means let the gentleman proceed
you ve made the apartment in a fit condition
there s pen and ink for you sir when you need
let every thing be noted with precision
i would not you for nothing should be feed
but as my maid s undrest pray turn your spies out
oh sobbd antonia i could tear their eyes out


there is the closet there the toilet there
the antechambersearch them under over
there is the sofa there the great armchair
the chimneywhich would really hold a lover
i wish to sleep and beg you will take care
and make no further noise till you discover
the secret cavern of this lurking treasure
and when t is found let me too have that pleasure


and now hidalgo now that you have thrown
doubt upon me confusion over all
pray have the courtesy to make it known
who is the man you search for how d ye cal
him what s his lineage let him but be shown
i hope he s young and handsomeis he tall
tell meand be assured that since you stain
my honour thus it shall not be in vain


at least perhaps he has not sixty years
at that age he would be too old for slaughter
or for so young a husbands jealous fears
antonia let me have a glass of water
i am ashamed of having shed these tears
they are unworthy of my fathers daughter
my mother dreamd not in my natal hour
that i should fall into a monsters power


perhaps t is of antonia you are jealous
you saw that she was sleeping by my side
when you broke in upon us with your fellows
look where you pleasewe ve nothing sir to hide
only another time i trust you ll tell us
or for the sake of decency abide
a moment at the door that we may be
drest to receive so much good company


and now sir i have done and say no more
the little i have said may serve to show
the guileless heart in silence may grieve oer
the wrongs to whose exposure it is slow
i leave you to your conscience as before
t will one day ask you why you used me so
god grant you feel not then the bitterest grief
antonia where s my pockethandkerchief


she ceased and turnd upon her pillow pale
she lay her dark eyes flashing through their tears
like skies that rain and lighten as a veil
waved and oershading her wan cheek appears
her streaming hair the black curls strive but fail
to hide the glossy shoulder which uprears
its snow through allher soft lips lie apart
and louder than her breathing beats her heart


the senhor don alfonso stood confused
antonia bustled round the ransackd room
and turning up her nose with looks abused
her master and his myrmidons of whom
not one except the attorney was amused
he like achates faithful to the tomb
so there were quarrels cared not for the cause
knowing they must be settled by the laws


with prying snubnose and small eyes he stood
following antonias motions here and there
with much suspicion in his attitude
for reputations he had little care
so that a suit or action were made good
small pity had he for the young and fair
and neer believed in negatives till these
were proved by competent false witnesses


but don alfonso stood with downcast looks
and truth to say he made a foolish figure
when after searching in five hundred nooks
and treating a young wife with so much rigour
he gaind no point except some selfrebukes
added to those his lady with such vigour
had pourd upon him for the last halfhour
quick thick and heavyas a thundershower


at first he tried to hammer an excuse
to which the sole reply was tears and sobs
and indications of hysterics whose
prologue is always certain throes and throbs
gasps and whatever else the owners choose
alfonso saw his wife and thought of jobs
he saw too in perspective her relations
and then he tried to muster all his patience


he stood in act to speak or rather stammer
but sage antonia cut him short before
the anvil of his speech received the hammer
with pray sir leave the room and say no more
or madam diesalfonso mutterd dn her
but nothing else the time of words was oer
he cast a rueful look or two and did
he knew not wherefore that which he was bid


with him retired his posse comitatus
the attorney last who lingerd near the door
reluctantly still tarrying there as late as
antonia let himnot a little sore
at this most strange and unexplaind hiatus
in don alfonsos facts which just now wore
an awkward look as he revolved the case
the door was fastend in his legal face


no sooner was it bolted thanoh shame
o sin oh sorrow and oh womankind
how can you do such things and keep your fame
unless this world and t other too be blind
nothing so dear as an unfilchd good name
but to proceedfor there is more behind
with much heartfelt reluctance be it said
young juan slippd halfsmotherd from the bed


he had been hidi dont pretend to say
how nor can i indeed describe the where
young slender and packd easily he lay
no doubt in little compass round or square
but pity him i neither must nor may
his suffocation by that pretty pair
t were better sure to die so than be shut
with maudlin clarence in his malmsey butt


and secondly i pity not because
he had no business to commit a sin
forbid by heavenly fined by human laws
at least t was rather early to begin
but at sixteen the conscience rarely gnaws
so much as when we call our old debts in
at sixty years and draw the accompts of evil
and find a deuced balance with the devil


of his position i can give no notion
t is written in the hebrew chronicle
how the physicians leaving pill and potion
prescribed by way of blister a young belle
when old king davids blood grew dull in motion
and that the medicine answerd very well
perhaps t was in a different way applied
for david lived but juan nearly died


what s to be done alfonso will be back
the moment he has sent his fools away
antonias skill was put upon the rack
but no device could be brought into play
and how to parry the renewd attack
besides it wanted but few hours of day
antonia puzzled julia did not speak
but pressd her bloodless lip to juans cheek


he turnd his lip to hers and with his hand
calld back the tangles of her wandering hair
even then their love they could not all command
and half forgot their danger and despair
antonias patience now was at a stand
come come t is no time now for fooling there
she whisperd in great wrathi must deposit
this pretty gentleman within the closet


pray keep your nonsense for some luckier night
who can have put my master in this mood
what will become on ti m in such a fright
the devil s in the urchin and no good
is this a time for giggling this a plight
why dont you know that it may end in blood
you ll lose your life and i shall lose my place
my mistress all for that halfgirlish face


had it but been for a stout cavalier
of twentyfive or thirty come make haste
but for a child what piece of work is here
i really madam wonder at your taste
come sir get inmy master must be near
there for the present at the least hes fast
and if we can but till the morning keep
our counseljuan mind you must not sleep


now don alfonso entering but alone
closed the oration of the trusty maid
she loiterd and he told her to be gone
an order somewhat sullenly obeyd
however present remedy was none
and no great good seemd answerd if she stayd
regarding both with slow and sidelong view
she snuffd the candle curtsied and withdrew


alfonso paused a minutethen begun
some strange excuses for his late proceeding
he would not justify what he had done
to say the best it was extreme illbreeding
but there were ample reasons for it none
of which he specified in this his pleading
his speech was a fine sample on the whole
of rhetoric which the learnd call rigmarole


julia said nought though all the while there rose
a ready answer which at once enables
a matron who her husbands foible knows
by a few timely words to turn the tables
which if it does not silence still must pose
even if it should comprise a pack of fables
t is to retort with firmness and when he
suspects with one do you reproach with three


julia in fact had tolerable grounds
alfonsos loves with inez were well known
but whether t was that ones own guilt confounds
but that cant be as has been often shown
a lady with apologies abounds
it might be that her silence sprang alone
from delicacy to don juans ear
to whom she knew his mothers fame was dear


there might be one more motive which makes two
alfonso neer to juan had alluded
mentiond his jealousy but never who
had been the happy lover he concluded
conceald amongst his premises t is true
his mind the more oer this its mystery brooded
to speak of inez now were one may say
like throwing juan in alfonsos way


a hint in tender cases is enough
silence is best besides there is a tact
that modern phrase appears to me sad stuff
but it will serve to keep my verse compact
which keeps when pushd by questions rather rough
a lady always distant from the fact
the charming creatures lie with such a grace
there s nothing so becoming to the face


they blush and we believe them at least i
have always done so t is of no great use
in any case attempting a reply
for then their eloquence grows quite profuse
and when at length they re out of breath they sigh
and cast their languid eyes down and let loose
a tear or two and then we make it up
and thenand thenand thensit down and sup


alfonso closed his speech and beggd her pardon
which julia half withheld and then half granted
and laid conditions he thought very hard on
denying several little things he wanted
he stood like adam lingering near his garden
with useless penitence perplexd and haunted
beseeching she no further would refuse
when lo he stumbled oer a pair of shoes


a pair of shoeswhat then not much if they
are such as fit with ladies feet but these
no one can tell how much i grieve to say
were masculine to see them and to seize
was but a moments actah welladay
my teeth begin to chatter my veins freeze
alfonso first examined well their fashion
and then flew out into another passion


he left the room for his relinquishd sword
and julia instant to the closet flew
fly juan fly for heavens sakenot a word
the door is openyou may yet slip through
the passage you so often have explored
here is the gardenkeyflyflyadieu
hastehaste i hear alfonsos hurrying feet
day has not brokethere s no one in the street


none can say that this was not good advice
the only mischief was it came too late
of all experience t is the usual price
a sort of incometax laid on by fate
juan had reachd the roomdoor in a trice
and might have done so by the gardengate
but met alfonso in his dressinggown
who threatend deathso juan knockd him down


dire was the scuffle and out went the light
antonia cried out rape and julia fire
but not a servant stirrd to aid the fight
alfonso pommelld to his hearts desire
swore lustily hed be revenged this night
and juan too blasphemed an octave higher
his blood was up though young he was a tartar
and not at all disposed to prove a martyr


alfonsos sword had droppd ere he could draw it
and they continued battling hand to hand
for juan very luckily neer saw it
his temper not being under great command
if at that moment he had chanced to claw it
alfonsos days had not been in the land
much longerthink of husbands lovers lives
and how ye may be doubly widowswives


alfonso grappled to detain the foe
and juan throttled him to get away
and blood t was from the nose began to flow
at last as they more faintly wrestling lay
juan contrived to give an awkward blow
and then his only garment quite gave way
he fled like joseph leaving it but there
i doubt all likeness ends between the pair


lights came at length and men and maids who found
an awkward spectacle their eyes before
antonia in hysterics julia swoond
alfonso leaning breathless by the door
some halftorn drapery scatterd on the ground
some blood and several footsteps but no more
juan the gate gaind turnd the key about
and liking not the inside lockd the out


here ends this cantoneed i sing or say
how juan naked favourd by the night
who favours what she should not found his way
and reachd his home in an unseemly plight
the pleasant scandal which arose next day
the nine days wonder which was brought to light
and how alfonso sued for a divorce
were in the english newspapers of course


if you would like to see the whole proceedings
the depositions and the cause at full
the names of all the witnesses the pleadings
of counsel to nonsuit or to annul
there s more than one edition and the readings
are various but they none of them are dull
the best is that in shorthand taen by gurney
who to madrid on purpose made a journey


but donna inez to divert the train
of one of the most circulating scandals
that had for centuries been known in spain
at least since the retirement of the vandals
first vowd and never had she vowd in vain
to virgin mary several pounds of candles
and then by the advice of some old ladies
she sent her son to be shippd off from cadiz


she had resolved that he should travel through
all european climes by land or sea
to mend his former morals and get new
especially in france and italy
at least this is the thing most people do
julia was sent into a convent she
grieved but perhaps her feelings may be better
shown in the following copy of her letter


they tell me t is decided you depart
t is wiset is well but not the less a pain
i have no further claim on your young heart
mine is the victim and would be again
to love too much has been the only art
i usedi write in haste and if a stain
be on this sheet t is not what it appears
my eyeballs burn and throb but have no tears


i loved i love you for this love have lost
state station heaven mankinds my own esteem
and yet can not regret what it hath cost
so dear is still the memory of that dream
yet if i name my guilt t is not to boast
none can deem harshlier of me than i deem
i trace this scrawl because i cannot rest
i ve nothing to reproach or to request


mans love is of mans life a thing apart
t is womans whole existence man may range
the court camp church the vessel and the mart
sword gown gain glory offer in exchange
pride fame ambition to fill up his heart
and few there are whom these cannot estrange
men have all these resources we but one
to love again and be again undone


you will proceed in pleasure and in pride
beloved and loving many all is oer
for me on earth except some years to hide
my shame and sorrow deep in my hearts core
these i could bear but cannot cast aside
the passion which still rages as before
and so farewellforgive me love meno
that word is idle nowbut let it go


my breast has been all weakness is so yet
but still i think i can collect my mind
my blood still rushes where my spirit s set
as roll the waves before the settled wind
my heart is feminine nor can forget
to all except one image madly blind
so shakes the needle and so stands the pole
as vibrates my fond heart to my fixd soul


i have no more to say but linger still
and dare not set my seal upon this sheet
and yet i may as well the task fulfil
my misery can scarce be more complete
i had not lived till now could sorrow kill
death shuns the wretch who fain the blow would meet
and i must even survive this last adieu
and bear with life to love and pray for you


this note was written upon giltedged paper
with a neat little crowquill slight and new
her small white hand could hardly reach the taper
it trembled as magnetic needles do
and yet she did not let one tear escape her
the seal a sunflower elle vous suit partout
the motto cut upon a white cornelian
the wax was superfine its hue vermilion


this was don juans earliest scrape but whether
i shall proceed with his adventures is
dependent on the public altogether
we ll see however what they say to this
their favour in an authors cap s a feather
and no great mischief s done by their caprice
and if their approbation we experience
perhaps they ll have some more about a year hence


my poem s epic and is meant to be
divided in twelve books each book containing
with love and war a heavy gale at sea
a list of ships and captains and kings reigning
new characters the episodes are three
a panoramic view of hell s in training
after the style of virgil and of homer
so that my name of epic s no misnomer


all these things will be specified in time
with strict regard to aristotles rules
the vade mecum of the true sublime
which makes so many poets and some fools
prose poets like blankverse i m fond of rhyme
good workmen never quarrel with their tools
i ve got new mythological machinery
and very handsome supernatural scenery


there s only one slight difference between
me and my epic brethren gone before
and here the advantage is my own i ween
not that i have not several merits more
but this will more peculiarly be seen
they so embellish that t is quite a bore
their labyrinth of fables to thread through
whereas this story s actually true


if any person doubt it i appeal
to history tradition and to facts
to newspapers whose truth all know and feel
to plays in five and operas in three acts
all these confirm my statement a good deal
but that which more completely faith exacts
is that myself and several now in seville
saw juans last elopement with the devil


if ever i should condescend to prose
i ll write poetical commandments which
shall supersede beyond all doubt all those
that went before in these i shall enrich
my text with many things that no one knows
and carry precept to the highest pitch
i ll call the work longinus oer a bottle
or every poet his own aristotle


thou shalt believe in milton dryden pope
thou shalt not set up wordsworth coleridge southey
because the first is crazed beyond all hope
the second drunk the third so quaint and mouthy
with crabbe it may be difficult to cope
and campbells hippocrene is somewhat drouthy
thou shalt not steal from samuel rogers nor
commitflirtation with the muse of moore


if any person should presume to assert
this story is not moral first i pray
that they will not cry out before they re hurt
then that they ll read it oer again and say
but doubtless nobody will be so pert
that this is not a moral tale though gay
besides in canto twelfth i mean to show
the very place where wicked people go


if after all there should be some so blind
to their own good this warning to despise
led by some tortuosity of mind
not to believe my verse and their own eyes
and cry that they the moral cannot find
i tell him if a clergyman he lies
should captains the remark or critics make
they also lie toounder a mistake


the public approbation i expect
and beg they ll take my word about the moral
which i with their amusement will connect
so children cutting teeth receive a coral
meantime they ll doubtless please to recollect
my epical pretensions to the laurel
for fear some prudish readers should grow skittish
i ve bribed my grandmothers reviewthe british


i sent it in a letter to the editor
who thankd me duly by return of post
i m for a handsome article his creditor
yet if my gentle muse he please to roast
and break a promise after having made it her
denying the receipt of what it cost
and smear his page with gall instead of honey
all i can say isthat he had the money


i think that with this holy new alliance
i may ensure the public and defy
all other magazines of art or science
daily or monthly or three monthly i
have not essayd to multiply their clients
because they tell me t were in vain to try
and that the edinburgh review and quarterly
treat a dissenting author very martyrly


non ego hoc ferrem calida juventa
consule planco horace said and so
say i by which quotation there is meant a
hint that some six or seven good years ago
long ere i dreamt of dating from the brenta
i was most ready to return a blow
and would not brook at all this sort of thing
in my hot youthwhen george the third was king


but now at thirty years my hair is grey
i wonder what it will be like at forty
i thought of a peruke the other day
my heart is not much greener and in short i
have squanderd my whole summer while t was may
and feel no more the spirit to retort i
have spent my life both interest and principal
and deem not what i deemd my soul invincible


no moreno moreoh never more on me
the freshness of the heart can fall like dew
which out of all the lovely things we see
extracts emotions beautiful and new
hived in our bosoms like the bag o the bee
thinkst thou the honey with those objects grew
alas t was not in them but in thy power
to double even the sweetness of a flower


no moreno moreoh never more my heart
canst thou be my sole world my universe
once all in all but now a thing apart
thou canst not be my blessing or my curse
the illusion s gone for ever and thou art
insensible i trust but none the worse
and in thy stead i ve got a deal of judgment
though heaven knows how it ever found a lodgment


my days of love are over me no more
the charms of maid wife and still less of widow
can make the fool of which they made before
in short i must not lead the life i did do
the credulous hope of mutual minds is oer
the copious use of claret is forbid too
so for a good oldgentlemanly vice
i think i must take up with avarice


ambition was my idol which was broken
before the shrines of sorrow and of pleasure
and the two last have left me many a token
oer which reflection may be made at leisure
now like friar bacons brazen head i ve spoken
time is time was time s pasta chymic treasure
is glittering youth which i have spent betimes
my heart in passion and my head on rhymes


what is the end of fame t is but to fill
a certain portion of uncertain paper
some liken it to climbing up a hill
whose summit like all hills is lost in vapour
for this men write speak preach and heroes kill
and bards burn what they call their midnight taper
to have when the original is dust
a name a wretched picture and worse bust


what are the hopes of man old egypts king
cheops erected the first pyramid
and largest thinking it was just the thing
to keep his memory whole and mummy hid
but somebody or other rummaging
burglariously broke his coffins lid
let not a monument give you or me hopes
since not a pinch of dust remains of cheops


but i being fond of true philosophy
say very often to myself alas
all things that have been born were born to die
and flesh which death mows down to hay is grass
you ve passd your youth not so unpleasantly
and if you had it oer againt would pass
so thank your stars that matters are no worse
and read your bible sir and mind your purse


but for the present gentle reader and
still gentler purchaser the bardthat s i
must with permission shake you by the hand
and so your humble servant and goodbye
we meet again if we should understand
each other and if not i shall not try
your patience further than by this short sample
t were well if others followd my example


go little book from this my solitude
i cast thee on the watersgo thy ways
and if as i believe thy vein be good
the world will find thee after many days
when southeys read and wordsworth understood
i cant help putting in my claim to praise
the four first rhymes are southeys every line
for gods sake reader take them not for mine


o ye who teach the ingenuous youth of nations
holland france england germany or spain
i pray ye flog them upon all occasions
it mends their morals never mind the pain
the best of mothers and of educations
in juans case were but employd in vain
since in a way that s rather of the oddest he
became divested of his native modesty


had he but been placed at a public school
in the third form or even in the fourth
his daily task had kept his fancy cool
at least had he been nurtured in the north
spain may prove an exception to the rule
but then exceptions always prove its worth
a lad of sixteen causing a divorce
puzzled his tutors very much of course


i cant say that it puzzles me at all
if all things be considerd first there was
his ladymother mathematical
anever mind his tutor an old ass
a pretty woman that s quite natural
or else the thing had hardly come to pass
a husband rather old not much in unity
with his young wifea time and opportunity


wellwell the world must turn upon its axis
and all mankind turn with it heads or tails
and live and die make love and pay our taxes
and as the veering wind shifts shift our sails
the king commands us and the doctor quacks us
the priest instructs and so our life exhales
a little breath love wine ambition fame
fighting devotion dustperhaps a name


i said that juan had been sent to cadiz
a pretty town i recollect it well
t is there the mart of the colonial trade is
or was before peru learnd to rebel
and such sweet girlsi mean such graceful ladies
their very walk would make your bosom swell
i cant describe it though so much it strike
nor liken iti never saw the like


an arab horse a stately stag a barb
new broke a cameleopard a gazelle
nonone of these will doand then their garb
their veil and petticoatalas to dwell
upon such things would very near absorb
a cantothen their feet and ankleswell
thank heaven i ve got no metaphor quite ready
and so my sober musecome let s be steady


chaste musewell if you must you mustthe veil
thrown back a moment with the glancing hand
while the oerpowering eye that turns you pale
flashes into the heartall sunny land
of love when i forget you may i fail
tosay my prayersbut never was there plannd
a dress through which the eyes give such a volley
excepting the venetian fazzioli


but to our tale the donna inez sent
her son to cadiz only to embark
to stay there had not answerd her intent
but whywe leave the reader in the dark
t was for a voyage that the young man was meant
as if a spanish ship were noahs ark
to wean him from the wickedness of earth
and send him like a dove of promise forth


don juan bade his valet pack his things
according to direction then received
a lecture and some money for four springs
he was to travel and though inez grieved
as every kind of parting has its stings
she hoped he would improveperhaps believed
a letter too she gave he never read it
of good adviceand two or three of credit


in the mean time to pass her hours away
brave inez now set up a sunday school
for naughty children who would rather play
like truant rogues the devil or the fool
infants of three years old were taught that day
dunces were whipt or set upon a stool
the great success of juans education
spurrd her to teach another generation


juan embarkdthe ship got under way
the wind was fair the water passing rough
a devil of a sea rolls in that bay
as i who ve crossd it oft know well enough
and standing upon deck the dashing spray
flies in ones face and makes it weathertough
and there he stood to take and take again
his firstperhaps his lastfarewell of spain


i cant but say it is an awkward sight
to see ones native land receding through
the growing waters it unmans one quite
especially when life is rather new
i recollect great britains coast looks white
but almost every other country s blue
when gazing on them mystified by distance
we enter on our nautical existence


so juan stood bewilderd on the deck
the wind sung cordage straind and sailors swore
and the ship creakd the town became a speck
from which away so fair and fast they bore
the best of remedies is a beefsteak
against seasickness try it sir before
you sneer and i assure you this is true
for i have found it answerso may you


don juan stood and gazing from the stern
beheld his native spain receding far
first partings form a lesson hard to learn
even nations feel this when they go to war
there is a sort of unexprest concern
a kind of shock that sets ones heart ajar
at leaving even the most unpleasant people
and places one keeps looking at the steeple


but juan had got many things to leave
his mother and a mistress and no wife
so that he had much better cause to grieve
than many persons more advanced in life
and if we now and then a sigh must heave
at quitting even those we quit in strife
no doubt we weep for those the heart endears
that is till deeper griefs congeal our tears


so juan wept as wept the captive jews
by babels waters still remembering sion
i d weepbut mine is not a weeping muse
and such light griefs are not a thing to die on
young men should travel if but to amuse
themselves and the next time their servants tie on
behind their carriages their new portmanteau
perhaps it may be lined with this my canto


and juan wept and much he sighd and thought
while his salt tears droppd into the salt sea
sweets to the sweet i like so much to quote
you must excuse this extract t is where she
the queen of denmark for ophelia brought
flowers to the grave and sobbing often he
reflected on his present situation
and seriously resolved on reformation


farewell my spain a long farewell he cried
perhaps i may revisit thee no more
but die as many an exiled heart hath died
of its own thirst to see again thy shore
farewell where guadalquivirs waters glide
farewell my mother and since all is oer
farewell too dearest juliahere he drew
her letter out again and read it through


and oh if eer i should forget i swear
but that s impossible and cannot be
sooner shall this blue ocean melt to air
sooner shall earth resolve itself to sea
than i resign thine image oh my fair
or think of any thing excepting thee
a mind diseased no remedy can physic
here the ship gave a lurch and he grew seasick


sooner shall heaven kiss earth here he fell sicker
o julia what is every other wo
for gods sake let me have a glass of liquor
pedro battista help me down below
julia my love you rascal pedro quicker
o julia this curst vessel pitches so
beloved julia hear me still beseeching
here he grew inarticulate with retching


he felt that chilling heaviness of heart
or rather stomach which alas attends
beyond the best apothecarys art
the loss of love the treachery of friends
or death of those we dote on when a part
of us dies with them as each fond hope ends
no doubt he would have been much more pathetic
but the sea acted as a strong emetic i


love s a capricious power i ve known it hold
out through a fever caused by its own heat
but be much puzzled by a cough and cold
and find a quincy very hard to treat
against all noble maladies he s bold
but vulgar illnesses dont like to meet
nor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh
nor inflammations redden his blind eye


but worst of all is nausea or a pain
about the lower region of the bowels
love who heroically breathes a vein
shrinks from the application of hot towels
and purgatives are dangerous to his reign
seasickness death his love was perfect how else
could juans passion while the billows roar
resist his stomach neer at sea before


the ship calld the most holy trinidada
was steering duly for the port leghorn
for there the spanish family moncada
were settled long ere juans sire was born
they were relations and for them he had a
letter of introduction which the morn
of his departure had been sent him by
his spanish friends for those in italy


his suite consisted of three servants and
a tutor the licentiate pedrillo
who several languages did understand
but now lay sick and speechless on his pillow
and rocking in his hammock longd for land
his headache being increased by every billow
and the waves oozing through the porthole made
his berth a little damp and him afraid


t was not without some reason for the wind
increased at night until it blew a gale
and though t was not much to a naval mind
some landsmen would have lookd a little pale
for sailors are in fact a different kind
at sunset they began to take in sail
for the sky showd it would come on to blow
and carry away perhaps a mast or so


at one oclock the wind with sudden shift
threw the ship right into the trough of the sea
which struck her aft and made an awkward rift
started the sternpost also shatterd the
whole of her sternframe and ere she could lift
herself from out her present jeopardy
the rudder tore away t was time to sound
the pumps and there were four feet water found


one gang of people instantly was put
upon the pumps and the remainder set
to get up part of the cargo and what not
but they could not come at the leak as yet
at last they did get at it really but
still their salvation was an even bet
the water rushd through in a way quite puzzling
while they thrust sheets shirts jackets bales of muslin


into the opening but all such ingredients
would have been vain and they must have gone down
despite of all their efforts and expedients
but for the pumps i m glad to make them known
to all the brother tars who may have need hence
for fifty tons of water were upthrown
by them per hour and they had all been undone
but for the maker mr mann of london


as day advanced the weather seemd to abate
and then the leak they reckond to reduce
and keep the ship afloat though three feet yet
kept two hand and one chainpump still in use
the wind blew fresh again as it grew late
a squall came on and while some guns broke loose
a gustwhich all descriptive power transcends
laid with one blast the ship on her beam ends


there she lay motionless and seemd upset
the water left the hold and washd the decks
and made a scene men do not soon forget
for they remember battles fires and wrecks
or any other thing that brings regret
or breaks their hopes or hearts or heads or necks
thus drownings are much talkd of by the divers
and swimmers who may chance to be survivors


immediately the masts were cut away
both main and mizen first the mizen went
the mainmast followd but the ship still lay
like a mere log and baffled our intent
foremast and bowsprit were cut down and they
eased her at last although we never meant
to part with all till every hope was blighted
and then with violence the old ship righted


it may be easily supposed while this
was going on some people were unquiet
that passengers would find it much amiss
to lose their lives as well as spoil their diet
that even the able seaman deeming his
days nearly oer might be disposed to riot
as upon such occasions tars will ask
for grog and sometimes drink rum from the cask


there s nought no doubt so much the spirit calms
as rum and true religion thus it was
some plunderd some drank spirits some sung psalms
the high wind made the treble and as bas
the hoarse harsh waves kept time fright cured the qualms
of all the luckless landsmens seasick maws
strange sounds of wailing blasphemy devotion
clamourd in chorus to the roaring ocean


perhaps more mischief had been done but for
our juan who with sense beyond his years
got to the spiritroom and stood before
it with a pair of pistols and their fears
as if death were more dreadful by his door
of fire than water spite of oaths and tears
kept still aloof the crew who ere they sunk
thought it would be becoming to die drunk


give us more grog they cried for it will be
all one an hour hence juan answerd no
t is true that death awaits both you and me
but let us die like men not sink below
like brutesand thus his dangerous post kept he
and none liked to anticipate the blow
and even pedrillo his most reverend tutor
was for some rum a disappointed suitor


the good old gentleman was quite aghast
and made a loud and pious lamentation
repented all his sins and made a last
irrevocable vow of reformation
nothing should tempt him more this peril past
to quit his academic occupation
in cloisters of the classic salamanca
to follow juans wake like sancho panca


but now there came a flash of hope once more
day broke and the wind lulld the masts were gone
the leak increased shoals round her but no shore
the vessel swam yet still she held her own
they tried the pumps again and though before
their desperate efforts seemd all useless grown
a glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale
the stronger pumpd the weaker thrummd a sail


under the vessels keel the sail was past
and for the moment it had some effect
but with a leak and not a stick of mast
nor rag of canvas what could they expect
but still t is best to struggle to the last
t is never too late to be wholly wreckd
and though t is true that man can only die once
t is not so pleasant in the gulf of lyons


there winds and waves had hurld them and from thence
without their will they carried them away
for they were forced with steering to dispense
and never had as yet a quiet day
on which they might repose or even commence
a jurymast or rudder or could say
the ship would swim an hour which by good luck
still swamthough not exactly like a duck


the wind in fact perhaps was rather less
but the ship labourd so they scarce could hope
to weather out much longer the distress
was also great with which they had to cope
for want of water and their solid mess
was scant enough in vain the telescope
was usednor sail nor shore appeard in sight
nought but the heavy sea and coming night


again the weather threatendagain blew
a gale and in the fore and after hold
water appeard yet though the people knew
all this the most were patient and some bold
until the chains and leathers were worn through
of all our pumpsa wreck complete she rolld
at mercy of the waves whose mercies are
like human beings during civil war


then came the carpenter at last with tears
in his rough eyes and told the captain he
could do no more he was a man in years
and long had voyaged through many a stormy sea
and if he wept at length they were not fears
that made his eyelids as a womans be
but he poor fellow had a wife and children
two things for dying people quite bewildering


the ship was evidently settling now
fast by the head and all distinction gone
some went to prayers again and made a vow
of candles to their saintsbut there were none
to pay them with and some lookd oer the bow
some hoisted out the boats and there was one
that beggd pedrillo for an absolution
who told him to be damndin his confusion


some lashd them in their hammocks some put on
their best clothes as if going to a fair
some cursed the day on which they saw the sun
and gnashd their teeth and howling tore their hair
and others went on as they had begun
getting the boats out being well aware
that a tight boat will live in a rough sea
unless with breakers close beneath her lee


the worst of all was that in their condition
having been several days in great distress
t was difficult to get out such provision
as now might render their long suffering less
men even when dying dislike inanition
their stock was damaged by the weathers stress
two casks of biscuit and a keg of butter
were all that could be thrown into the cutter


but in the longboat they contrived to stow
some pounds of bread though injured by the wet
water a twentygallon cask or so
six flasks of wine and they contrived to get
a portion of their beef up from below
and with a piece of pork moreover met
but scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon
then there was rum eight gallons in a puncheon


the other boats the yawl and pinnace had
been stove in the beginning of the gale
and the longboats condition was but bad
as there were but two blankets for a sail
and one oar for a mast which a young lad
threw in by good luck over the ships rail
and two boats could not hold far less be stored
to save one half the people then on board


t was twilight and the sunless day went down
over the waste of waters like a veil
which if withdrawn would but disclose the frown
of one whose hate is maskd but to assail
thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown
and grimly darkled oer the faces pale
and the dim desolate deep twelve days had fear
been their familiar and now death was here


some trial had been making at a raft
with little hope in such a rolling sea
a sort of thing at which one would have laughd
if any laughter at such times could be
unless with people who too much have quaffd
and have a kind of wild and horrid glee
half epileptical and half hysterical
their preservation would have been a miracle


at halfpast eight oclock booms hencoops spars
and all things for a chance had been cast loose
that still could keep afloat the struggling tars
for yet they strove although of no great use
there was no light in heaven but a few stars
the boats put off oercrowded with their crews
she gave a heel and then a lurch to port
and going down head foremostsunk in short


then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell
then shriekd the timid and stood still the brave
then some leapd overboard with dreadful yell
as eager to anticipate their grave
and the sea yawnd around her like a hell
and down she suckd with her the whirling wave
like one who grapples with his enemy
and strives to strangle him before he die


and first one universal shriek there rushd
louder than the loud ocean like a crash
of echoing thunder and then all was hushd
save the wild wind and the remorseless dash
of billows but at intervals there gushd
accompanied with a convulsive splash
a solitary shriek the bubbling cry
of some strong swimmer in his agony


the boats as stated had got off before
and in them crowded several of the crew
and yet their present hope was hardly more
than what it had been for so strong it blew
there was slight chance of reaching any shore
and then they were too many though so few
nine in the cutter thirty in the boat
were counted in them when they got afloat


all the rest perishd near two hundred souls
had left their bodies and what s worse alas
when over catholics the ocean rolls
they must wait several weeks before a mass
takes off one peck of purgatorial coals
because till people know what s come to pass
they wont lay out their money on the dead
it costs three francs for every mass that s said


juan got into the longboat and there
contrived to help pedrillo to a place
it seemd as if they had exchanged their care
for juan wore the magisterial face
which courage gives while poor pedrillos pair
of eyes were crying for their owners case
battista though a name calld shortly tita
was lost by getting at some aquavita


pedro his valet too he tried to save
but the same cause conducive to his loss
left him so drunk he jumpd into the wave
as oer the cutters edge he tried to cross
and so he found a wineandwatery grave
they could not rescue him although so close
because the sea ran higher every minute
and for the boatthe crew kept crowding in it


a small old spanielwhich had been don joses
his fathers whom he loved as ye may think
for on such things the memory reposes
with tendernessstood howling on the brink
knowing dogs have such intellectual noses
no doubt the vessel was about to sink
and juan caught him up and ere he steppd
off threw him in then after him he leapd


he also stuffd his money where he could
about his person and pedrillos too
who let him do in fact whateer he would
not knowing what himself to say or do
as every rising wave his dread renewd
but juan trusting they might still get through
and deeming there were remedies for any ill
thus reembarkd his tutor and his spaniel


t was a rough night and blew so stiffly yet
that the sail was becalmd between the seas
though on the waves high top too much to set
they dared not take it in for all the breeze
each sea curld oer the stern and kept them wet
and made them bale without a moments ease
so that themselves as well as hopes were dampd
and the poor little cutter quickly swampd


nine souls more went in her the longboat still
kept above water with an oar for mast
two blankets stitchd together answering ill
instead of sail were to the oar made fast
though every wave rolld menacing to fill
and present peril all before surpassd
they grieved for those who perishd with the cutter
and also for the biscuitcasks and butter


the sun rose red and fiery a sure sign
of the continuance of the gale to run
before the sea until it should grow fine
was all that for the present could be done
a few teaspoonfuls of their rum and wine
were served out to the people who begun
to faint and damaged bread wet through the bags
and most of them had little clothes but rags


they counted thirty crowded in a space
which left scarce room for motion or exertion
they did their best to modify their case
one half sate up though numbd with the immersion
while tother half were laid down in their place
at watch and watch thus shivering like the tertian
ague in its cold fit they filld their boat
with nothing but the sky for a great coat


t is very certain the desire of life
prolongs it this is obvious to physicians
when patients neither plagued with friends nor wife
survive through very desperate conditions
because they still can hope nor shines the knife
nor shears of atropos before their visions
despair of all recovery spoils longevity
and makes men miseries miseries of alarming brevity


t is said that persons living on annuities
are longer lived than othersgod knows why
unless to plague the grantorsyet so true it is
that some i really think do never die
of any creditors the worst a jew it is
and that s their mode of furnishing supply
in my young days they lent me cash that way
which i found very troublesome to pay


t is thus with people in an open boat
they live upon the love of life and bear
more than can be believed or even thought
and stand like rocks the tempests wear and tear
and hardship still has been the sailors lot
since noahs ark went cruising here and there
she had a curious crew as well as cargo
like the first old greek privateer the argo


but man is a carnivorous production
and must have meals at least one meal a day
he cannot live like woodcocks upon suction
but like the shark and tiger must have prey
although his anatomical construction
bears vegetables in a grumbling way
your labouring people think beyond all question
beef veal and mutton better for digestion


and thus it was with this our hapless crew
for on the third day there came on a calm
and though at first their strength it might renew
and lying on their weariness like balm
lulld them like turtles sleeping on the blue
of ocean when they woke they felt a qualm
and fell all ravenously on their provision
instead of hoarding it with due precision


the consequence was easily foreseen
they ate up all they had and drank their wine
in spite of all remonstrances and then
on what in fact next day were they to dine
they hoped the wind would rise these foolish men
and carry them to shore these hopes were fine
but as they had but one oar and that brittle
it would have been more wise to save their victual


the fourth day came but not a breath of air
and ocean slumberd like an unweand child
the fifth day and their boat lay floating there
the sea and sky were blue and clear and mild
with their one oar i wish they had had a pair
what could they do and hungers rage grew wild
so juans spaniel spite of his entreating
was killd and portiond out for present eating


on the sixth day they fed upon his hide
and juan who had still refused because
the creature was his fathers dog that died
now feeling all the vulture in his jaws
with some remorse received though first denied
as a great favour one of the forepaws
which he divided with pedrillo who
devourd it longing for the other too


the seventh day and no windthe burning sun
blisterd and scorchd and stagnant on the sea
they lay like carcasses and hope was none
save in the breeze that came not savagely
they glared upon each otherall was done
water and wine and foodand you might see
the longings of the cannibal arise
although they spoke not in their wolfish eyes


at length one whisperd his companion who
whisperd another and thus it went round
and then into a hoarser murmur grew
an ominous and wild and desperate sound
and when his comrades thought each sufferer knew
t was but his own suppressd till now he found
and out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood
and who should die to be his fellows food


but ere they came to this they that day shared
some leathern caps and what remaind of shoes
and then they lookd around them and despaird
and none to be the sacrifice would choose
at length the lots were torn up and prepared
but of materials that much shock the muse
having no paper for the want of better
they took by force from juan julias letter


the lots were made and markd and mixd and handed
in silent horror and their distribution
lulld even the savage hunger which demanded
like the promethean vulture this pollution
none in particular had sought or plannd it
t was nature gnawd them to this resolution
by which none were permitted to be neuter
and the lot fell on juans luckless tutor


he but requested to be bled to death
the surgeon had his instruments and bled
pedrillo and so gently ebbd his breath
you hardly could perceive when he was dead
he died as born a catholic in faith
like most in the belief in which they re bred
and first a little crucifix he kissd
and then held out his jugular and wrist


the surgeon as there was no other fee
had his first choice of morsels for his pains
but being thirstiest at the moment he
preferrd a draught from the fastflowing veins
part was divided part thrown in the sea
and such things as the entrails and the brains
regaled two sharks who followd oer the billow
the sailors ate the rest of poor pedrillo


the sailors ate him all save three or four
who were not quite so fond of animal food
to these was added juan who before
refusing his own spaniel hardly could
feel now his appetite increased much more
t was not to be expected that he should
even in extremity of their disaster
dine with them on his pastor and his master


t was better that he did not for in fact
the consequence was awful in the extreme
for they who were most ravenous in the act
went raging madlord how they did blaspheme
and foam and roll with strange convulsions rackd
drinking salt water like a mountainstream
tearing and grinning howling screeching swearing
and with hyaenalaughter died despairing


their numbers were much thinnd by this infliction
and all the rest were thin enough heaven knows
and some of them had lost their recollection
happier than they who still perceived their woes
but others ponderd on a new dissection
as if not warnd sufficiently by those
who had already perishd suffering madly
for having used their appetites so sadly


and next they thought upon the masters mate
as fattest but he saved himself because
besides being much averse from such a fate
there were some other reasons the first was
he had been rather indisposed of late
and that which chiefly proved his saving clause
was a small present made to him at cadiz
by general subscription of the ladies


of poor pedrillo something still remaind
but was used sparinglysome were afraid
and others still their appetites constraind
or but at times a little supper made
all except juan who throughout abstaind
chewing a piece of bamboo and some lead
at length they caught two boobies and a noddy
and then they left off eating the dead body


and if pedrillos fate should shocking be
remember ugolino condescends
to eat the head of his archenemy
the moment after he politely ends
his tale if foes be food in hell at sea
t is surely fair to dine upon our friends
when shipwrecks short allowance grows too scanty
without being much more horrible than dante


and the same night there fell a shower of rain
for which their mouths gaped like the cracks of earth
when dried to summer dust till taught by pain
men really know not what good water s worth
if you had been in turkey or in spain
or with a famishd boatscrew had your berth
or in the desert heard the camels bell
you d wish yourself where truth isin a well


it pourd down torrents but they were no richer
until they found a ragged piece of sheet
which served them as a sort of spongy pitcher
and when they deemd its moisture was complete
they wrung it out and though a thirsty ditcher
might not have thought the scanty draught so sweet
as a full pot of porter to their thinking
they neer till now had known the joys of drinking


and their baked lips with many a bloody crack
suckd in the moisture which like nectar streamd
their throats were ovens their swoln tongues were black
as the rich mans in hell who vainly screamd
to beg the beggar who could not rain back
a drop of dew when every drop had seemd
to taste of heavenif this be true indeed
some christians have a comfortable creed


there were two fathers in this ghastly crew
and with them their two sons of whom the one
was more robust and hardy to the view
but he died early and when he was gone
his nearest messmate told his sire who threw
one glance at him and said heavens will be done
i can do nothing and he saw him thrown
into the deep without a tear or groan


the other father had a weaklier child
of a soft cheek and aspect delicate
but the boy bore up long and with a mild
and patient spirit held aloof his fate
little he said and now and then he smiled
as if to win a part from off the weight
he saw increasing on his fathers heart
with the deep deadly thought that they must part


and oer him bent his sire and never raised
his eyes from off his face but wiped the foam
from his pale lips and ever on him gazed
and when the wishdfor shower at length was come
and the boys eyes which the dull film half glazed
brightend and for a moment seemd to roam
he squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain
into his dying childs mouthbut in vain


the boy expiredthe father held the clay
and lookd upon it long and when at last
death left no doubt and the dead burthen lay
stiff on his heart and pulse and hope were past
he watchd it wistfully until away
t was borne by the rude wave wherein t was cast
then he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering
and gave no sign of life save his limbs quivering


now overhead a rainbow bursting through
the scattering clouds shone spanning the dark sea
resting its bright base on the quivering blue
and all within its arch appeard to be
clearer than that without and its wide hue
waxd broad and waving like a banner free
then changed like to a bow that s bent and then
forsook the dim eyes of these shipwreckd men


it changed of course a heavenly chameleon
the airy child of vapour and the sun
brought forth in purple cradled in vermilion
baptized in molten gold and swathed in dun
glittering like crescents oer a turks pavilion
and blending every colour into one
just like a black eye in a recent scuffle
for sometimes we must box without the muffle


our shipwreckd seamen thought it a good omen
it is as well to think so now and then
t was an old custom of the greek and roman
and may become of great advantage when
folks are discouraged and most surely no men
had greater need to nerve themselves again
than these and so this rainbow lookd like hope
quite a celestial kaleidoscope


about this time a beautiful white bird
webfooted not unlike a dove in size
and plumage probably it might have errd
upon its course passd oft before their eyes
and tried to perch although it saw and heard
the men within the boat and in this guise
it came and went and flutterd round them till
night fell this seemd a better omen still


but in this case i also must remark
t was well this bird of promise did not perch
because the tackle of our shatterd bark
was not so safe for roosting as a church
and had it been the dove from noahs ark
returning there from her successful search
which in their way that moment chanced to fall
they would have eat her olivebranch and all


with twilight it again came on to blow
but not with violence the stars shone out
the boat made way yet now they were so low
they knew not where nor what they were about
some fancied they saw land and some said no
the frequent fogbanks gave them cause to doubt
some swore that they heard breakers others guns
and all mistook about the latter once


as morning broke the light wind died away
when he who had the watch sung out and swore
if t was not land that rose with the suns ray
he wishd that land he never might see more
and the rest rubbd their eyes and saw a bay
or thought they saw and shaped their course for shore
for shore it was and gradually grew
distinct and high and palpable to view


and then of these some part burst into tears
and others looking with a stupid stare
could not yet separate their hopes from fears
and seemd as if they had no further care
while a few prayd the first time for some years
and at the bottom of the boat three were
asleep they shook them by the hand and head
and tried to awaken them but found them dead


the day before fast sleeping on the water
they found a turtle of the hawksbill kind
and by good fortune gliding softly caught her
which yielded a days life and to their mind
proved even still a more nutritious matter
because it left encouragement behind
they thought that in such perils more than chance
had sent them this for their deliverance


the land appeard a high and rocky coast
and higher grew the mountains as they drew
set by a current toward it they were lost
in various conjectures for none knew
to what part of the earth they had been tost
so changeable had been the winds that blew
some thought it was mount aetna some the highlands
of candia cyprus rhodes or other islands


meantime the current with a rising gale
still set them onwards to the welcome shore
like charons bark of spectres dull and pale
their living freight was now reduced to four
and three dead whom their strength could not avail
to heave into the deep with those before
though the two sharks still followd them and dashd
the spray into their faces as they splashd


famine despair cold thirst and heat had done
their work on them by turns and thinnd them to
such things a mother had not known her son
amidst the skeletons of that gaunt crew
by night chilld by day scorchd thus one by one
they perishd until witherd to these few
but chiefly by a species of selfslaughter
in washing down pedrillo with salt water


as they drew nigh the land which now was seen
unequal in its aspect here and there
they felt the freshness of its growing green
that waved in foresttops and smoothd the air
and fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen
from glistening waves and skies so hot and bare
lovely seemd any object that should sweep
away the vast salt dread eternal deep


the shore lookd wild without a trace of man
and girt by formidable waves but they
were mad for land and thus their course they ran
though right ahead the roaring breakers lay
a reef between them also now began
to show its boiling surf and bounding spray
but finding no place for their landing better
they ran the boat for shoreand overset her


but in his native stream the guadalquivir
juan to lave his youthful limbs was wont
and having learnt to swim in that sweet river
had often turnd the art to some account
a better swimmer you could scarce see ever
he could perhaps have passd the hellespont
as once a feat on which ourselves we prided
leander mr ekenhead and i did


so here though faint emaciated and stark
he buoyd his boyish limbs and strove to ply
with the quick wave and gain ere it was dark
the beach which lay before him high and dry
the greatest danger here was from a shark
that carried off his neighbour by the thigh
as for the other two they could not swim
so nobody arrived on shore but him


nor yet had he arrived but for the oar
which providentially for him was washd
just as his feeble arms could strike no more
and the hard wave oerwhelmd him as t was dashd
within his grasp he clung to it and sore
the waters beat while he thereto was lashd
at last with swimming wading scrambling he
rolld on the beach halfsenseless from the sea


there breathless with his digging nails he clung
fast to the sand lest the returning wave
from whose reluctant roar his life he wrung
should suck him back to her insatiate grave
and there he lay full length where he was flung
before the entrance of a cliffworn cave
with just enough of life to feel its pain
and deem that it was saved perhaps in vain


with slow and staggering effort he arose
but sunk again upon his bleeding knee
and quivering hand and then he lookd for those
who long had been his mates upon the sea
but none of them appeard to share his woes
save one a corpse from out the famishd three
who died two days before and now had found
an unknown barren beach for burial ground


and as he gazed his dizzy brain spun fast
and down he sunk and as he sunk the sand
swam round and round and all his senses passd
he fell upon his side and his stretchd hand
droopd dripping on the oar their jurymast
and like a witherd lily on the land
his slender frame and pallid aspect lay
as fair a thing as eer was formd of clay


how long in his damp trance young juan lay
he knew not for the earth was gone for him
and time had nothing more of night nor day
for his congealing blood and senses dim
and how this heavy faintness passd away
he knew not till each painful pulse and limb
and tingling vein seemd throbbing back to life
for death though vanquishd still retired with strife


his eyes he opend shut again unclosed
for all was doubt and dizziness he thought
he still was in the boat and had but dozed
and felt again with his despair oerwrought
and wishd it death in which he had reposed
and then once more his feelings back were brought
and slowly by his swimming eyes was seen
a lovely female face of seventeen


t was bending dose oer his and the small mouth
seemd almost prying into his for breath
and chafing him the soft warm hand of youth
recalld his answering spirits back from death
and bathing his chill temples tried to soothe
each pulse to animation till beneath
its gentle touch and trembling care a sigh
to these kind efforts made a low reply


then was the cordial pourd and mantle flung
around his scarceclad limbs and the fair arm
raised higher the faint head which oer it hung
and her transparent cheek all pure and warm
pillowd his deathlike forehead then she wrung
his dewy curls long drenchd by every storm
and watchd with eagerness each throb that drew
a sigh from his heaved bosomand hers too


and lifting him with care into the cave
the gentle girl and her attendantone
young yet her elder and of brow less grave
and more robust of figurethen begun
to kindle fire and as the new flames gave
light to the rocks that roofd them which the sun
had never seen the maid or whatsoeer
she was appeard distinct and tall and fair


her brow was overhung with coins of gold
that sparkled oer the auburn of her hair
her clustering hair whose longer locks were rolld
in braids behind and though her stature were
even of the highest for a female mould
they nearly reachd her heel and in her air
there was a something which bespoke command
as one who was a lady in the land


her hair i said was auburn but her eyes
were black as death their lashes the same hue
of downcast length in whose silk shadow lies
deepest attraction for when to the view
forth from its raven fringe the full glance flies
neer with such force the swiftest arrow flew
t is as the snake late coild who pours his length
and hurls at once his venom and his strength


her brow was white and low her cheeks pure dye
like twilight rosy still with the set sun
short upper lipsweet lips that make us sigh
ever to have seen such for she was one
fit for the model of a statuary
a race of mere impostors when all s done
i ve seen much finer women ripe and real
than all the nonsense of their stone ideal


i ll tell you why i say so for t is just
one should not rail without a decent cause
there was an irish lady to whose bust
i neer saw justice done and yet she was
a frequent model and if eer she must
yield to stern time and natures wrinkling laws
they will destroy a face which mortal thought
neer compassd nor less mortal chisel wrought


and such was she the lady of the cave
her dress was very different from the spanish
simpler and yet of colours not so grave
for as you know the spanish women banish
bright hues when out of doors and yet while wave
around them what i hope will never vanish
the basquina and the mantilla they
seem at the same time mystical and gay


but with our damsel this was not the case
her dress was manycolourd finely spun
her locks curld negligently round her face
but through them gold and gems profusely shone
her girdle sparkled and the richest lace
flowd in her veil and many a precious stone
flashd on her little hand but what was shocking
her small snow feet had slippers but no stocking


the other females dress was not unlike
but of inferior materials she
had not so many ornaments to strike
her hair had silver only bound to be
her dowry and her veil in form alike
was coarser and her air though firm less free
her hair was thicker but less long her eyes
as black but quicker and of smaller size


and these two tended him and cheerd him both
with food and raiment and those soft attentions
which are as i must own of female growth
and have ten thousand delicate inventions
they made a most superior mess of broth
a thing which poesy but seldom mentions
but the best dish that eer was cookd since homers
achilles ordered dinner for new comers


i ll tell you who they were this female pair
lest they should seem princesses in disguise
besides i hate all mystery and that air
of claptrap which your recent poets prize
and so in short the girls they really were
they shall appear before your curious eyes
mistress and maid the first was only daughter
of an old man who lived upon the water


a fisherman he had been in his youth
and still a sort of fisherman was he
but other speculations were in sooth
added to his connection with the sea
perhaps not so respectable in truth
a little smuggling and some piracy
left him at last the sole of many masters
of an illgotten million of piastres


a fisher therefore was hethough of men
like peter the apostleand he fishd
for wandering merchantvessels now and then
and sometimes caught as many as he wishd
the cargoes he confiscated and gain
he sought in the slavemarket too and dishd
full many a morsel for that turkish trade
by which no doubt a good deal may be made


he was a greek and on his isle had built
one of the wild and smaller cyclades
a very handsome house from out his guilt
and there he lived exceedingly at ease
heaven knows what cash he got or blood he spilt
a sad old fellow was he if you please
but this i know it was a spacious building
full of barbaric carving paint and gilding


he had an only daughter calld haidee
the greatest heiress of the eastern isles
besides so very beautiful was she
her dowry was as nothing to her smiles
still in her teens and like a lovely tree
she grew to womanhood and between whiles
rejected several suitors just to learn
how to accept a better in his turn


and walking out upon the beach below
the cliff towards sunset on that day she found
insensiblenot dead but nearly so
don juan almost famishd and half drownd
but being naked she was shockd you know
yet deemd herself in common pity bound
as far as in her lay to take him in
a stranger dying with so white a skin


but taking him into her fathers house
was not exactly the best way to save
but like conveying to the cat the mouse
or people in a trance into their grave
because the good old man had so much nous
unlike the honest arab thieves so brave
he would have hospitably cured the stranger
and sold him instantly when out of danger


and therefore with her maid she thought it best
a virgin always on her maid relies
to place him in the cave for present rest
and when at last he opend his black eyes
their charity increased about their guest
and their compassion grew to such a size
it opend half the turnpikegates to heaven
st paul says t is the toll which must be given


they made a firebut such a fire as they
upon the moment could contrive with such
materials as were cast up round the bay
some broken planks and oars that to the touch
were nearly tinder since so long they lay
a mast was almost crumbled to a crutch
but by gods grace here wrecks were in such plenty
that there was fuel to have furnishd twenty


he had a bed of furs and a pelisse
for haidee stripped her sables off to make
his couch and that he might be more at ease
and warm in case by chance he should awake
they also gave a petticoat apiece
she and her maidand promised by daybreak
to pay him a fresh visit with a dish
for breakfast of eggs coffee bread and fish


and thus they left him to his lone repose
juan slept like a top or like the dead
who sleep at last perhaps god only knows
just for the present and in his lulld head
not even a vision of his former woes
throbbd in accursed dreams which sometimes spread
unwelcome visions of our former years
till the eye cheated opens thick with tears


young juan slept all dreamlessbut the maid
who smoothd his pillow as she left the den
lookd back upon him and a moment stayd
and turnd believing that he calld again
he slumberd yet she thought at least she said
the heart will slip even as the tongue and pen
he had pronounced her namebut she forgot
that at this moment juan knew it not


and pensive to her fathers house she went
enjoining silence strict to zoe who
better than her knew what in fact she meant
she being wiser by a year or two
a year or two s an age when rightly spent
and zoe spent hers as most women do
in gaining all that useful sort of knowledge
which is acquired in natures good old college


the morn broke and found juan slumbering still
fast in his cave and nothing clashd upon
his rest the rushing of the neighbouring rill
and the young beams of the excluded sun
troubled him not and he might sleep his fill
and need he had of slumber yet for none
had sufferd morehis hardships were comparative
to those related in my granddads narrative


not so haidee she sadly tossd and tumbled
and started from her sleep and turning oer
dreamd of a thousand wrecks oer which she stumbled
and handsome corpses strewd upon the shore
and woke her maid so early that she grumbled
and calld her fathers old slaves up who swore
in several oathsarmenian turk and greek
they knew not what to think of such a freak


but up she got and up she made them get
with some pretence about the sun that makes
sweet skies just when he rises or is set
and t is no doubt a sight to see when breaks
bright phoebus while the mountains still are wet
with mist and every bird with him awakes
and night is flung off like a mourning suit
worn for a husbandor some other brute


i say the sun is a most glorious sight
i ve seen him rise full oft indeed of late
i have sat up on purpose all the night
which hastens as physicians say ones fate
and so all ye who would be in the right
in health and purse begin your day to date
from daybreak and when coffind at fourscore
engrave upon the plate you rose at four


and haidee met the morning face to face
her own was freshest though a feverish flush
had dyed it with the headlong blood whose race
from heart to cheek is curbd into a blush
like to a torrent which a mountains base
that overpowers some alpine rivers rush
checks to a lake whose waves in circles spread
or the red seabut the sea is not red


and down the cliff the island virgin came
and near the cave her quick light footsteps drew
while the sun smiled on her with his first flame
and young aurora kissd her lips with dew
taking her for a sister just the same
mistake you would have made on seeing the two
although the mortal quite as fresh and fair
had all the advantage too of not being air


and when into the cavern haidee steppd
all timidly yet rapidly she saw
that like an infant juan sweetly slept
and then she stoppd and stood as if in awe
for sleep is awful and on tiptoe crept
and wrapt him closer lest the air too raw
should reach his blood then oer him still as death
bent with hushd lips that drank his scarcedrawn breath


and thus like to an angel oer the dying
who die in righteousness she leand and there
all tranquilly the shipwreckd boy was lying
as oer him the calm and stirless air
but zoe the meantime some eggs was frying
since after all no doubt the youthful pair
must breakfastand betimes lest they should ask it
she drew out her provision from the basket


she knew that the best feelings must have victual
and that a shipwreckd youth would hungry be
besides being less in love she yawnd a little
and felt her veins chilld by the neighbouring sea
and so she cookd their breakfast to a tittle
i cant say that she gave them any tea
but there were eggs fruit coffee bread fish honey
with scio wineand all for love not money


and zoe when the eggs were ready and
the coffee made would fain have wakend juan
but haidee stoppd her with her quick small hand
and without word a sign her finger drew on
her lip which zoe needs must understand
and the first breakfast spoilt prepared a new one
because her mistress would not let her break
that sleep which seemd as it would neer awake


for still he lay and on his thin worn cheek
a purple hectic playd like dying day
on the snowtops of distant hills the streak
of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay
where the blue veins lookd shadowy shrunk and weak
and his black curls were dewy with the spray
which weighd upon them yet all damp and salt
mixd with the stony vapours of the vault


and she bent oer him and he lay beneath
hushd as the babe upon its mothers breast
droopd as the willow when no winds can breathe
lulld like the depth of ocean when at rest
fair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath
soft as the callow cygnet in its nest
in short he was a very pretty fellow
although his woes had turnd him rather yellow


he woke and gazed and would have slept again
but the fair face which met his eyes forbade
those eyes to close though weariness and pain
had further sleep a further pleasure made
for womans face was never formd in vain
for juan so that even when he prayd
he turnd from grisly saints and martyrs hairy
to the sweet portraits of the virgin mary


and thus upon his elbow he arose
and lookd upon the lady in whose cheek
the pale contended with the purple rose
as with an effort she began to speak
her eyes were eloquent her words would pose
although she told him in good modern greek
with an ionian accent low and sweet
that he was faint and must not talk but eat


now juan could not understand a word
being no grecian but he had an ear
and her voice was the warble of a bird
so soft so sweet so delicately clear
that finer simpler music neer was heard
the sort of sound we echo with a tear
without knowing whyan overpowering tone
whence melody descends as from a throne


and juan gazed as one who is awoke
by a distant organ doubting if he be
not yet a dreamer till the spell is broke
by the watchman or some such reality
or by ones early valets cursed knock
at least it is a heavy sound to me
who like a morning slumberfor the night
shows stars and women in a better light


and juan too was helpd out from his dream
or sleep or whatsoer it was by feeling
a most prodigious appetite the steam
of zoes cookery no doubt was stealing
upon his senses and the kindling beam
of the new fire which zoe kept up kneeling
to stir her viands made him quite awake
and long for food but chiefly a beefsteak


but beef is rare within these oxless isles
goats flesh there is no doubt and kid and mutton
and when a holiday upon them smiles
a joint upon their barbarous spits they put on
but this occurs but seldom between whiles
for some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on
others are fair and fertile among which
this though not large was one of the most rich


i say that beef is rare and cant help thinking
that the old fable of the minotaur
from which our modern morals rightly shrinking
condemn the royal ladys taste who wore
a cows shape for a maskwas only sinking
the allegory a mere type no more
that pasiphae promoted breeding cattle
to make the cretans bloodier in battle


for we all know that english people are
fed upon beefi wont say much of beer
because t is liquor only and being far
from this my subject has no business here
we know too they very fond of war
a pleasurelike all pleasuresrather dear
so were the cretansfrom which i infer
that beef and battles both were owing to her


but to resume the languid juan raised
his head upon his elbow and he saw
a sight on which he had not lately gazed
as all his latter meals had been quite raw
three or four things for which the lord he praised
and feeling still the famishd vulture gnaw
he fell upon whateer was offerd like
a priest a shark an alderman or pike


he ate and he was well supplied and she
who watchd him like a mother would have fed
him past all bounds because she smiled to see
such appetite in one she had deemd dead
but zoe being older than haidee
knew by tradition for she neer had read
that famishd people must be slowly nurst
and fed by spoonfuls else they always burst


and so she took the liberty to state
rather by deeds than words because the case
was urgent that the gentleman whose fate
had made her mistress quit her bed to trace
the seashore at this hour must leave his plate
unless he wishd to die upon the place
she snatchd it and refused another morsel
saying he had gorged enough to make a horse ill


next theyhe being naked save a tatterd
pair of scarce decent trowserswent to work
and in the fire his recent rags they scatterd
and dressd him for the present like a turk
or greekthat is although it not much matterd
omitting turban slippers pistols dirk
they furnishd him entire except some stitches
with a clean shirt and very spacious breeches


and then fair haidee tried her tongue at speaking
but not a word could juan comprehend
although he listend so that the young greek in
her earnestness would neer have made an end
and as he interrupted not went eking
her speech out to her protege and friend
till pausing at the last her breath to take
she saw he did not understand romaic


and then she had recourse to nods and signs
and smiles and sparkles of the speaking eye
and read the only book she could the lines
of his fair face and found by sympathy
the answer eloquent where soul shines
and darts in one quick glance a long reply
and thus in every look she saw exprest
a world of words and things at which she guessd


and now by dint of fingers and of eyes
and words repeated after her he took
a lesson in her tongue but by surmise
no doubt less of her language than her look
as he who studies fervently the skies
turns oftener to the stars than to his book
thus juan learnd his alpha beta better
from haidees glance than any graven letter


t is pleasing to be schoold in a strange tongue
by female lips and eyesthat is i mean
when both the teacher and the taught are young
as was the case at least where i have been
they smile so when one s right and when one s wrong
they smile still more and then there intervene
pressure of hands perhaps even a chaste kiss
i learnd the little that i know by this


that is some words of spanish turk and greek
italian not at all having no teachers
much english i cannot pretend to speak
learning that language chiefly from its preachers
barrow south tillotson whom every week
i study also blair the highest reachers
of eloquence in piety and prose
i hate your poets so read none of those


as for the ladies i have nought to say
a wanderer from the british world of fashion
where i like other dogs have had my day
like other men too may have had my passion
but that like other things has passd away
and all her fools whom i could lay the lash on
foes friends men women now are nought to me
but dreams of what has been no more to be


return we to don juan he begun
to hear new words and to repeat them but
some feelings universal as the sun
were such as could not in his breast be shut
more than within the bosom of a nun
he was in loveas you would be no doubt
with a young benefactressso was she
just in the way we very often see


and every day by daybreakrather early
for juan who was somewhat fond of rest
she came into the cave but it was merely
to see her bird reposing in his nest
and she would softly stir his locks so curly
without disturbing her yet slumbering guest
breathing all gently oer his cheek and mouth
as oer a bed of roses the sweet south


and every morn his colour freshlier came
and every day helpd on his convalescence
t was well because health in the human frame
is pleasant besides being true loves essence
for health and idleness to passions flame
are oil and gunpowder and some good lessons
are also learnt from ceres and from bacchus
without whom venus will not long attack us


while venus fills the heart without heart really
love though good always is not quite so good
ceres presents a plate of vermicelli
for love must be sustaind like flesh and blood
while bacchus pours out wine or hands a jelly
eggs oysters too are amatory food
but who is their purveyor from above
heaven knowsit may be neptune pan or jove


when juan woke he found some good things ready
a bath a breakfast and the finest eyes
that ever made a youthful heart less steady
besides her maids as pretty for their size
but i have spoken of all this already
and repetition s tiresome and unwise
welljuan after bathing in the sea
came always back to coffee and haidee


both were so young and one so innocent
that bathing passd for nothing juan seemd
to her as twere the kind of being sent
of whom these two years she had nightly dreamd
a something to be loved a creature meant
to be her happiness and whom she deemd
to render happy all who joy would win
must share ithappiness was born a twin


it was such pleasure to behold him such
enlargement of existence to partake
nature with him to thrill beneath his touch
to watch him slumbering and to see him wake
to live with him forever were too much
but then the thought of parting made her quake
he was her own her oceantreasure cast
like a rich wreckher first love and her last


and thus a moon rolld on and fair haidee
paid daily visits to her boy and took
such plentiful precautions that still he
remaind unknown within his craggy nook
at last her fathers prows put out to sea
for certain merchantmen upon the look
not as of yore to carry off an io
but three ragusan vessels bound for scio


then came her freedom for she had no mother
so that her father being at sea she was
free as a married woman or such other
female as where she likes may freely pass
without even the incumbrance of a brother
the freest she that ever gazed on glass
i speak of christian lands in this comparison
where wives at least are seldom kept in garrison


now she prolongd her visits and her talk
for they must talk and he had learnt to say
so much as to propose to take a walk
for little had he wanderd since the day
on which like a young flower snappd from the stalk
drooping and dewy on the beach he lay
and thus they walkd out in the afternoon
and saw the sun set opposite the moon


it was a wild and breakerbeaten coast
with cliffs above and a broad sandy shore
guarded by shoals and rocks as by an host
with here and there a creek whose aspect wore
a better welcome to the tempesttost
and rarely ceased the haughty billows roar
save on the dead long summer days which make
the outstretchd ocean glitter like a lake


and the small ripple spilt upon the beach
scarcely oerpassd the cream of your champagne
when oer the brim the sparkling bumpers reach
that springdew of the spirit the hearts rain
few things surpass old wine and they may preach
who pleasethe more because they preach in vain
let us have wine and women mirth and laughter
sermons and sodawater the day after


man being reasonable must get drunk
the best of life is but intoxication
glory the grape love gold in these are sunk
the hopes of all men and of every nation
without their sap how branchless were the trunk
of lifes strange tree so fruitful on occasion
but to returnget very drunk and when
you wake with headache you shall see what then


ring for your valetbid him quickly bring
some hock and sodawater then you ll know
a pleasure worthy xerxes the great king
for not the blessd sherbet sublimed with snow
nor the first sparkle of the desertspring
nor burgundy in all its sunset glow
after long travel ennui love or slaughter
vie with that draught of hock and sodawater


the coasti think it was the coast that
was just describingyes it was the coast
lay at this period quiet as the sky
the sands untumbled the blue waves untost
and all was stillness save the seabirds cry
and dolphins leap and little billow crost
by some low rock or shelve that made it fret
against the boundary it scarcely wet


and forth they wanderd her sire being gone
as i have said upon an expedition
and mother brother guardian she had none
save zoe who although with due precision
she waited on her lady with the sun
thought daily service was her only mission
bringing warm water wreathing her long tresses
and asking now and then for castoff dresses


it was the cooling hour just when the rounded
red sun sinks down behind the azure hill
which then seems as if the whole earth it bounded
circling all nature hushd and dim and still
with the far mountaincrescent half surrounded
on one side and the deep sea calm and chill
upon the other and the rosy sky
with one star sparkling through it like an eye


and thus they wanderd forth and hand in hand
over the shining pebbles and the shells
glided along the smooth and hardend sand
and in the worn and wild receptacles
workd by the storms yet workd as it were plannd
in hollow halls with sparry roofs and cells
they turnd to rest and each claspd by an arm
yielded to the deep twilights purple charm


they lookd up to the sky whose floating glow
spread like a rosy ocean vast and bright
they gazed upon the glittering sea below
whence the broad moon rose circling into sight
they heard the waves splash and the wind so low
and saw each others dark eyes darting light
into each otherand beholding this
their lips drew near and clung into a kiss


a long long kiss a kiss of youth and love
and beauty all concentrating like rays
into one focus kindled from above
such kisses as belong to early days
where heart and soul and sense in concert move
and the blood s lava and the pulse a blaze
each kiss a heartquakefor a kisss strength
i think it must be reckond by its length


by length i mean duration theirs endured
heaven knows how longno doubt they never reckond
and if they had they could not have secured
the sum of their sensations to a second
they had not spoken but they felt allured
as if their souls and lips each other beckond
which being joind like swarming bees they clung
their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung


they were alone but not alone as they
who shut in chambers think it loneliness
the silent ocean and the starlight bay
the twilight glow which momently grew less
the voiceless sands and dropping caves that lay
around them made them to each other press
as if there were no life beneath the sky
save theirs and that their life could never die


they feard no eyes nor ears on that lone beach
they felt no terrors from the night they were
all in all to each other though their speech
was broken words they thought a language there
and all the burning tongues the passions teach
found in one sigh the best interpreter
of natures oraclefirst lovethat all
which eve has left her daughters since her fall


haidde spoke not of scruples askd no vows
nor offerd any she had never heard
of plight and promises to be a spouse
or perils by a loving maid incurrd
she was all which pure ignorance allows
and flew to her young mate like a young bird
and never having dreamt of falsehood she
had not one word to say of constancy


she loved and was belovedshe adored
and she was worshippd after natures fashion
their intense souls into each other pourd
if souls could die had perishd in that passion
but by degrees their senses were restored
again to be oercome again to dash on
and beating gainst his bosom haidees heart
felt as if never more to beat apart


alas they were so young so beautiful
so lonely loving helpless and the hour
was that in which the heart is always full
and having oer itself no further power
prompts deeds eternity can not annul
but pays off moments in an endless shower
of hellfireall prepared for people giving
pleasure or pain to one another living


alas for juan and haidee they were
so loving and so lovelytill then never
excepting our first parents such a pair
had run the risk of being damnd for ever
and haidee being devout as well as fair
had doubtless heard about the stygian river
and hell and purgatorybut forgot
just in the very crisis she should not


they look upon each other and their eyes
gleam in the moonlight and her white arm clasps
round juans head and his around her lies
half buried in the tresses which it grasps
she sits upon his knee and drinks his sighs
he hers until they end in broken gasps
and thus they form a group that s quite antique
half naked loving natural and greek


and when those deep and burning moments passd
and juan sunk to sleep within her arms
she slept not but all tenderly though fast
sustaind his head upon her bosoms charms
and now and then her eye to heaven is cast
and then on the pale cheek her breast now warms
pillowd on her oerflowing heart which pants
with all it granted and with all it grants


an infant when it gazes on a light
a child the moment when it drains the breast
a devotee when soars the host in sight
an arab with a stranger for a guest
a sailor when the prize has struck in fight
a miser filling his most hoarded chest
feel rapture but not such true joy are reaping
as they who watch oer what they love while sleeping


for there it lies so tranquil so beloved
all that it hath of life with us is living
so gentle stirless helpless and unmoved
and all unconscious of the joy t is giving
all it hath felt inflicted passd and proved
hushd into depths beyond the watchers diving
there lies the thing we love with all its errors
and all its charms like death without its terrors


the lady watchd her loverand that hour
of loves and nights and oceans solitude
oerflowd her soul with their united power
amidst the barren sand and rocks so rude
she and her waveworn love had made their bower
where nought upon their passion could intrude
and all the stars that crowded the blue space
saw nothing happier than her glowing face


alas the love of women it is known
to be a lovely and a fearful thing
for all of theirs upon that die is thrown
and if t is lost life hath no more to bring
to them but mockeries of the past alone
and their revenge is as the tigers spring
deadly and quick and crushing yet as real
torture is theirs what they inflict they feel


they are right for man to man so oft unjust
is always so to women one sole bond
awaits them treachery is all their trust
taught to conceal their bursting hearts despond
over their idol till some wealthier lust
buys them in marriageand what rests beyond
a thankless husband next a faithless lover
then dressing nursing praying and all s over


some take a lover some take drams or prayers
some mind their household others dissipation
some run away and but exchange their cares
losing the advantage of a virtuous station
few changes eer can better their affairs
theirs being an unnatural situation
from the dull palace to the dirty hovel
some play the devil and then write a novel


haidee was natures bride and knew not this
haidee was passions child born where the sun
showers triple light and scorches even the kiss
of his gazelleeyed daughters she was one
made but to love to feel that she was his
who was her chosen what was said or done
elsewhere was nothing she had naught to fear
hope care nor love beyond her heart beat here


and oh that quickening of the heart that beat
how much it costs us yet each rising throb
is in its cause as its effect so sweet
that wisdom ever on the watch to rob
joy of its alchymy and to repeat
fine truths even conscience too has a tough job
to make us understand each good old maxim
so goodi wonder castlereagh dont tax em


and now t was doneon the lone shore were plighted
their hearts the stars their nuptial torches shed
beauty upon the beautiful they lighted
ocean their witness and the cave their bed
by their own feelings hallowd and united
their priest was solitude and they were wed
and they were happy for to their young eyes
each was an angel and earth paradise


o love of whom great caesar was the suitor
titus the master antony the slave
horace catullus scholars ovid tutor
sappho the sage bluestocking in whose grave
all those may leap who rather would be neuter
leucadias rock still overlooks the wave
o love thou art the very god of evil
for after all we cannot call thee devil


thou makst the chaste connubial state precarious
and jestest with the brows of mightiest men
caesar and pompey mahomet belisarius
have much employd the muse of historys pen
their lives and fortunes were extremely various
such worthies time will never see again
yet to these four in three things the same luck holds
they all were heroes conquerors and cuckolds


thou makst philosophers there s epicurus
and aristippus a material crew
who to immoral courses would allure us
by theories quite practicable too
if only from the devil they would insure us
how pleasant were the maxim not quite new
eat drink and love what can the rest avail us
so said the royal sage sardanapalus


but juan had he quite forgotten julia
and should he have forgotten her so soon
i cant but say it seems to me most truly
perplexing question but no doubt the moon
does these things for us and whenever newly
strong palpitation rises t is her boon
else how the devil is it that fresh features
have such a charm for us poor human creatures


i hate inconstancyi loathe detest
abhor condemn abjure the mortal made
of such quicksilver clay that in his breast
no permanent foundation can be laid
love constant love has been my constant guest
and yet last night being at a masquerade
i saw the prettiest creature fresh from milan
which gave me some sensations like a villain


but soon philosophy came to my aid
and whisperd think of every sacred tie
i will my dear philosophy i said
but then her teeth and then oh heaven her eye
ill just inquire if she be wife or maid
or neitherout of curiosity
stop cried philosophy with air so grecian
though she was masqued then as a fair venetian


stop so i stoppdbut to return that which
men call inconstancy is nothing more
than admiration due where natures rich
profusion with young beauty covers oer
some favourd object and as in the niche
a lovely statue we almost adore
this sort of adoration of the real
is but a heightening of the beau ideal


t is the perception of the beautiful
a fine extension of the faculties
platonic universal wonderful
drawn from the stars and filterd through the skies
without which life would be extremely dull
in short it is the use of our own eyes
with one or two small senses added just
to hint that flesh is formd of fiery dust


yet t is a painful feeling and unwilling
for surely if we always could perceive
in the same object graces quite as killing
as when she rose upon us like an eve
t would save us many a heartache many a shilling
for we must get them any how or grieve
whereas if one sole lady pleased for ever
how pleasant for the heart as well as liver


the heart is like the sky a part of heaven
but changes night and day too like the sky
now oer it clouds and thunder must be driven
and darkness and destruction as on high
but when it hath been scorchd and pierced and riven
its storms expire in waterdrops the eye
pours forth at last the hearts blood turnd to tears
which make the english climate of our years


the liver is the lazaret of bile
but very rarely executes its function
for the first passion stays there such a while
that all the rest creep in and form a junction
life knots of vipers on a dunghills soil
rage fear hate jealousy revenge compunction
so that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail
like earthquakes from the hidden fire calld central


in the mean time without proceeding more
in this anatomy i ve finishd now
two hundred and odd stanzas as before
that being about the number i ll allow
each canto of the twelve or twentyfour
and laying down my pen i make my bow
leaving don juan and haidee to plead
for them and theirs with all who deign to read


hail muse et ceterawe left juan sleeping
pillowd upon a fair and happy breast
and watchd by eyes that never yet knew weeping
and loved by a young heart too deeply blest
to feel the poison through her spirit creeping
or know who rested there a foe to rest
had soild the current of her sinless years
and turnd her pure hearts purest blood to tears


o love what is it in this world of ours
which makes it fatal to be loved ah why
with cypress branches hast thou wreathed thy bowers
and made thy best interpreter a sigh
as those who dote on odours pluck the flowers
and place them on their breastbut place to die
thus the frail beings we would fondly cherish
are laid within our bosoms but to perish


in her first passion woman loves her lover
in all the others all she loves is love
which grows a habit she can neer get over
and fits her looselylike an easy glove
as you may find wheneer you like to prove her
one man alone at first her heart can move
she then prefers him in the plural number
not finding that the additions much encumber


i know not if the fault be mens or theirs
but one thing s pretty sure a woman planted
unless at once she plunge for life in prayers
after a decent time must be gallanted
although no doubt her first of love affairs
is that to which her heart is wholly granted
yet there are some they say who have had none
but those who have neer end with only one


t is melancholy and a fearful sign
of human frailty folly also crime
that love and marriage rarely can combine
although they both are born in the same clime
marriage from love like vinegar from wine
a sad sour sober beverageby time
is sharpend from its high celestial flavour
down to a very homely household savour


there s something of antipathy as t were
between their present and their future state
a kind of flattery that s hardly fair
is used until the truth arrives too late
yet what can people do except despair
the same things change their names at such a rate
for instancepassion in a lover s glorious
but in a husband is pronounced uxorious


men grow ashamed of being so very fond
they sometimes also get a little tired
but that of course is rare and then despond
the same things cannot always be admired
yet t is so nominated in the bond
that both are tied till one shall have expired
sad thought to lose the spouse that was adorning
our days and put ones servants into mourning


there s doubtless something in domestic doings
which forms in fact true loves antithesis
romances paint at full length peoples wooings
but only give a bust of marriages
for no one cares for matrimonial cooings
there s nothing wrong in a connubial kiss
think you if laura had been petrarchs wife
he would have written sonnets all his life


all tragedies are finishd by a death
all comedies are ended by a marriage
the future states of both are left to faith
for authors fear description might disparage
the worlds to come of both or fall beneath
and then both worlds would punish their miscarriage
so leaving each their priest and prayerbook ready
they say no more of death or of the lady


the only two that in my recollection
have sung of heaven and hell or marriage are
dante and milton and of both the affection
was hapless in their nuptials for some bar
of fault or temper ruind the connection
such things in fact it dont ask much to mar
but dantes beatrice and miltons eve
were not drawn from their spouses you conceive


some persons say that dante meant theology
by beatrice and not a mistressi
although my opinion may require apology
deem this a commentators fantasy
unless indeed it was from his own knowledge he
decided thus and showd good reason why
i think that dantes more abstruse ecstatics
meant to personify the mathematics


haidee and juan were not married but
the fault was theirs not mine it is not fair
chaste reader then in any way to put
the blame on me unless you wish they were
then if you d have them wedded please to shut
the book which treats of this erroneous pair
before the consequences grow too awful
t is dangerous to read of loves unlawful


yet they were happyhappy in the illicit
indulgence of their innocent desires
but more imprudent grown with every visit
haidee forgot the island was her sires
when we have what we like t is hard to miss it
at least in the beginning ere one tires
thus she came often not a moment losing
whilst her piratical papa was cruising


let not his mode of raising cash seem strange
although he fleeced the flags of every nation
for into a prime minister but change
his title and t is nothing but taxation
but he more modest took an humbler range
of life and in an honester vocation
pursued oer the high seas his watery journey
and merely practised as a seaattorney


the good old gentleman had been detaind
by winds and waves and some important captures
and in the hope of more at sea remaind
although a squall or two had dampd his raptures
by swamping one of the prizes he had chaind
his prisoners dividing them like chapters
in numberd lots they all had cuffs and collars
and averaged each from ten to a hundred dollars


some he disposed of off cape matapan
among his friends the mainots some he sold
to his tunis correspondents save one man
tossd overboard unsaleable being old
the restsave here and there some richer one
reserved for future ransomin the hold
were linkd alike as for the common people he
had a large order from the dey of tripoli


the merchandise was served in the same way
pieced out for different marts in the levant
except some certain portions of the prey
light classic articles of female want
french stuffs lace tweezers toothpicks teapot tray
guitars and castanets from alicant
all which selected from the spoil he gathers
robbd for his daughter by the best of fathers


a monkey a dutch mastiff a mackaw
two parrots with a persian cat and kittens
he chose from several animals he saw
a terrier too which once had been a britons
who dying on the coast of ithaca
the peasants gave the poor dumb thing a pittance
these to secure in this strong blowing weather
he caged in one huge hamper altogether


then having settled his marine affairs
despatching single cruisers here and there
his vessel having need of some repairs
he shaped his course to where his daughter fair
continued still her hospitable cares
but that part of the coast being shoal and bare
and rough with reefs which ran out many a mile
his port lay on the other side o the isle


and there he went ashore without delay
having no customhouse nor quarantine
to ask him awkward questions on the way
about the time and place where he had been
he left his ship to be hove down next day
with orders to the people to careen
so that all hands were busy beyond measure
in getting out goods ballast guns and treasure


arriving at the summit of a hill
which overlookd the white walls of his home
he stoppdwhat singular emotions fill
their bosoms who have been induced to roam
with fluttering doubts if all be well or ill
with love for many and with fears for some
all feelings which oerleap the years long lost
and bring our hearts back to their startingpost


the approach of home to husbands and to sires
after long travelling by land or water
most naturally some small doubt inspires
a female family s a serious matter
none trusts the sex more or so much admires
but they hate flattery so i never flatter
wives in their husbands absences grow subtler
and daughters sometimes run off with the butler


an honest gentleman at his return
may not have the good fortune of ulysses
not all lone matrons for their husbands mourn
or show the same dislike to suitors kisses
the odds are that he finds a handsome urn
to his memoryand two or three young misses
born to some friend who holds his wife and riches
and that his argusbites him by the breeches


if single probably his plighted fair
has in his absence wedded some rich miser
but all the better for the happy pair
may quarrel and the lady growing wiser
he may resume his amatory care
as cavalier servente or despise her
and that his sorrow may not be a dumb one
write odes on the inconstancy of woman


and oh ye gentlemen who have already
some chaste liaison of the kindi mean
an honest friendship with a married lady
the only thing of this sort ever seen
to lastof all connections the most steady
and the true hymen the first s but a screen
yet for all that keep not too long away
i ve known the absent wrongd four times a day


lambro our seasolicitor who had
much less experience of dry land than ocean
on seeing his own chimneysmoke felt glad
but not knowing metaphysics had no notion
of the true reason of his not being sad
or that of any other strong emotion
he loved his child and would have wept the loss of her
but knew the cause no more than a philosopher


he saw his white walls shining in the sun
his garden trees all shadowy and green
he heard his rivulets light bubbling run
the distant dogbark and perceived between
the umbrage of the wood so cool and dun
the moving figures and the sparkling sheen
of arms in the east all armand various dyes
of colourd garbs as bright as butterflies


and as the spot where they appear he nears
surprised at these unwonted signs of idling
he hearsalas no music of the spheres
but an unhallowd earthly sound of fiddling
a melody which made him doubt his ears
the cause being past his guessing or unriddling
a pipe too and a drum and shortly after
a most unoriental roar of laughter


and still more nearly to the place advancing
descending rather quickly the declivity
through the waved branches oer the greensward glancing
midst other indications of festivity
seeing a troop of his domestics dancing
like dervises who turn as on a pivot he
perceived it was the pyrrhic dance so martial
to which the levantines are very partial


and further on a group of grecian girls
the first and tallest her white kerchief waving
were strung together like a row of pearls
linkd hand in hand and dancing each too having
down her white neck long floating auburn curls
the least of which would set ten poets raving
their leader sangand bounded to her song
with choral step and voice the virgin throng


and here assembled crossleggd round their trays
small social parties just begun to dine
pilaus and meats of all sorts met the gaze
and flasks of samian and of chian wine
and sherbet cooling in the porous vase
above them their dessert grew on its vine
the orange and pomegranate nodding oer
droppd in their laps scarce pluckd their mellow store


a band of children round a snowwhite ram
there wreathe his venerable horns with flowers
while peaceful as if still an unweand lamb
the patriarch of the flock all gently cowers
his sober head majestically tame
or eats from out the palm or playful lowers
his brow as if in act to butt and then
yielding to their small hands draws back again


their classical profiles and glittering dresses
their large black eyes and soft seraphic cheeks
crimson as cleft pomegranates their long tresses
the gesture which enchants the eye that speaks
the innocence which happy childhood blesses
made quite a picture of these little greeks
so that the philosophical beholder
sighd for their sakesthat they should eer grow older


afar a dwarf buffoon stood telling tales
to a sedate grey circle of old smokers
of secret treasures found in hidden vales
of wonderful replies from arab jokers
of charms to make good gold and cure bad ails
of rocks bewitchd that open to the knockers
of magic ladies who by one sole act
transformd their lords to beasts but that s a fact


here was no lack of innocent diversion
for the imagination or the senses
song dance wine music stories from the persian
all pretty pastimes in which no offence is
but lambro saw all these things with aversion
perceiving in his absence such expenses
dreading that climax of all human ills
the inflammation of his weekly bills


ah what is man what perils still environ
the happiest mortals even after dinner
a day of gold from out an age of iron
is all that life allows the luckiest sinner
pleasure wheneer she sings at least s a siren
that lures to flay alive the young beginner
lambros reception at his peoples banquet
was such as fire accords to a wet blanket


hebeing a man who seldom used a word
too much and wishing gladly to surprise
in general he surprised men with the sword
his daughterhad not sent before to advise
of his arrival so that no one stirrd
and long he paused to reassure his eyes
in fact much more astonishd than delighted
to find so much good company invited


he did not know alas how men will lie
that a report especially the greeks
avouchd his death such people never die
and put his house in mourning several weeks
but now their eyes and also lips were dry
the bloom too had returnd to haidees cheeks
her tears too being returnd into their fount
she now kept house upon her own account


hence all this rice meat dancing wine and fiddling
which turnd the isle into a place of pleasure
the servants all were getting drunk or idling
a life which made them happy beyond measure
her fathers hospitality seemd middling
compared with what haidee did with his treasure
t was wonderful how things went on improving
while she had not one hour to spare from loving


perhaps you think in stumbling on this feast
he flew into a passion and in fact
there was no mighty reason to be pleased
perhaps you prophesy some sudden act
the whip the rack or dungeon at the least
to teach his people to be more exact
and that proceeding at a very high rate
he showd the royal penchants of a pirate


you re wronghe was the mildest mannerd man
that ever scuttled ship or cut a throat
with such true breeding of a gentleman
you never could divine his real thought
no courtier could and scarcely woman can
gird more deceit within a petticoat
pity he loved adventurous lifes variety
he was so great a loss to good society


advancing to the nearest dinner tray
tapping the shoulder of the nighest guest
with a peculiar smile which by the way
boded no good whatever it expressd
he askd the meaning of this holiday
the vinous greek to whom he had addressd
his question much too merry to divine
the questioner filld up a glass of wine


and without turning his facetious head
over his shoulder with a bacchant air
presented the oerflowing cup and said
talking s dry work i have no time to spare
a second hiccupd our old master s dead
you d better ask our mistress who s his heir
our mistress quoth a third our mistresspooh
you mean our masternot the old but new


these rascals being new comers knew not whom
they thus addressdand lambros visage fell
and oer his eye a momentary gloom
passd but he strove quite courteously to quell
the expression and endeavouring to resume
his smile requested one of them to tell
the name and quality of his new patron
who seemd to have turnd haidee into a matron


i know not quoth the fellow who or what
he is nor whence he cameand little care
but this i know that this roast capon s fat
and that good wine neer washd down better fare
and if you are not satisfied with that
direct your questions to my neighbour there
he ll answer all for better or for worse
for none likes more to hear himself converse


i said that lambro was a man of patience
and certainly he showd the best of breeding
which scarce even france the paragon of nations
eer saw her most polite of sons exceeding
he bore these sneers against his near relations
his own anxiety his heart too bleeding
the insults too of every servile glutton
who all the time was eating up his mutton


now in a person used to much command
to bid men come and go and come again
to see his orders done too out of hand
whether the word was death or but the chain
it may seem strange to find his manners bland
yet such things are which i can not explain
though doubtless he who can command himself
is good to governalmost as a guelf


not that he was not sometimes rash or so
but never in his real and serious mood
then calm concentrated and still and slow
he lay coild like the boa in the wood
with him it never was a word and blow
his angry word once oer he shed no blood
but in his silence there was much to rue
and his one blow left little work for two


he askd no further questions and proceeded
on to the house but by a private way
so that the few who met him hardly heeded
so little they expected him that day
if love paternal in his bosom pleaded
for haidees sake is more than i can say
but certainly to one deemd dead returning
this revel seemd a curious mode of mourning


if all the dead could now return to life
which god forbid or some or a great many
for instance if a husband or his wife
nuptial examples are as good as any
no doubt whateer might be their former strife
the present weather would be much more rainy
tears shed into the grave of the connection
would share most probably its resurrection


he enterd in the house no more his home
a thing to human feelings the most trying
and harder for the heart to overcome
perhaps than even the mental pangs of dying
to find our hearthstone turnd into a tomb
and round its once warm precincts palely lying
the ashes of our hopes is a deep grief
beyond a single gentlemans belief


he enterd in the househis home no more
for without hearts there is no home and felt
the solitude of passing his own door
without a welcome there he long had dwelt
there his few peaceful days time had swept oer
there his worn bosom and keen eye would melt
over the innocence of that sweet child
his only shrine of feelings undefiled


he was a man of a strange temperament
of mild demeanour though of savage mood
moderate in all his habits and content
with temperance in pleasure as in food
quick to perceive and strong to bear and meant
for something better if not wholly good
his countrys wrongs and his despair to save her
had stung him from a slave to an enslaver


the love of power and rapid gain of gold
the hardness by long habitude produced
the dangerous life in which he had grown old
the mercy he had granted oft abused
the sights he was accustomd to behold
the wild seas and wild men with whom he cruised
had cost his enemies a long repentance
and made him a good friend but bad acquaintance


but something of the spirit of old greece
flashd oer his soul a few heroic rays
such as lit onward to the golden fleece
his predecessors in the colchian days
t is true he had no ardent love for peace
alas his country showd no path to praise
hate to the world and war with every nation
he waged in vengeance of her degradation


still oer his mind the influence of the clime
shed its ionian elegance which showd
its power unconsciously full many a time
a taste seen in the choice of his abode
a love of music and of scenes sublime
a pleasure in the gentle stream that flowd
past him in crystal and a joy in flowers
bedewd his spirit in his calmer hours


but whatsoeer he had of love reposed
on that beloved daughter she had been
the only thing which kept his heart unclosed
amidst the savage deeds he had done and seen
a lonely pure affection unopposed
there wanted but the loss of this to wean
his feelings from all milk of human kindness
and turn him like the cyclops mad with blindness


the cubless tigress in her jungle raging
is dreadful to the shepherd and the flock
the ocean when its yeasty war is waging
is awful to the vessel near the rock
but violent things will sooner bear assuaging
their fury being spent by its own shock
than the stern single deep and wordless ire
of a strong human heart and in a sire


it is a hard although a common case
to find our children running restivethey
in whom our brightest days we would retrace
our little selves reformd in finer clay
just as old age is creeping on apace
and clouds come oer the sunset of our day
they kindly leave us though not quite alone
but in good companythe gout or stone


yet a fine family is a fine thing
provided they dont come in after dinner
t is beautiful to see a matron bring
her children up if nursing them dont thin her
like cherubs round an altarpiece they cling
to the fireside a sight to touch a sinner
a lady with her daughters or her nieces
shines like a guinea and sevenshilling pieces


old lambro passd unseen a private gate
and stood within his hall at eventide
meantime the lady and her lover sate
at wassail in their beauty and their pride
an ivory inlaid table spread with state
before them and fair slaves on every side
gems gold and silver formd the service mostly
mother of pearl and coral the less costly


the dinner made about a hundred dishes
lamb and pistachio nutsin short all meats
and saffron soups and sweetbreads and the fishes
were of the finest that eer flounced in nets
drest to a sybarites most pamperd wishes
the beverage was various sherbets
of raisin orange and pomegranate juice
squeezed through the rind which makes it best for use


these were ranged round each in its crystal ewer
and fruits and datebread loaves closed the repast
and mochas berry from arabia pure
in small fine china cups came in at last
gold cups of filigree made to secure
the hand from burning underneath them placed
cloves cinnamon and saffron too were boild
up with the coffee which i think they spoild


the hangings of the room were tapestry made
of velvet panels each of different hue
and thick with damask flowers of silk inlaid
and round them ran a yellow border too
the upper border richly wrought displayd
embroiderd delicately oer with blue
soft persian sentences in lilac letters
from poets or the moralists their betters


these oriental writings on the wall
quite common in those countries are a kind
of monitors adapted to recall
like skulls at memphian banquets to the mind
the words which shook belshazzar in his hall
and took his kingdom from him you will find
though sages may pour out their wisdoms treasure
there is no sterner moralist than pleasure


a beauty at the seasons close grown hectic
a genius who has drunk himself to death
a rake turnd methodistic or eclectic
for that s the name they like to pray beneath
but most an alderman struck apoplectic
are things that really take away the breath
and show that late hours wine and love are able
to do not much less damage than the table


haidee and juan carpeted their feet
on crimson satin borderd with pale blue
their sofa occupied three parts complete
of the apartmentand appeard quite new
the velvet cushions for a throne more meet
were scarlet from whose glowing centre grew
a sun embossd in gold whose rays of tissue
meridianlike were seen all light to issue


crystal and marble plate and porcelain
had done their work of splendour indian mats
and persian carpets which the heart bled to stain
over the floors were spread gazelles and cats
and dwarfs and blacks and such like things that gain
their bread as ministers and favourites that s
to say by degradation mingled there
as plentiful as in a court or fair


there was no want of lofty mirrors and
the tables most of ebony inlaid
with mother of pearl or ivory stood at hand
or were of tortoiseshell or rare woods made
fretted with gold or silverby command
the greater part of these were ready spread
with viands and sherbets in iceand wine
kept for all comers at all hours to dine


of all the dresses i select haidees
she wore two jelicksone was of pale yellow
of azure pink and white was her chemise
neath which her breast heaved like a little billow
with buttons formd of pearls as large as peas
all gold and crimson shone her jelicks fellow
and the striped white gauze baracan that bound her
like fleecy clouds about the moon flowd round her


one large gold bracelet claspd each lovely arm
locklessso pliable from the pure gold
that the hand stretchd and shut it without harm
the limb which it adornd its only mould
so beautifulits very shape would charm
and clinging as if loath to lose its hold
the purest ore enclosed the whitest skin
that eer by precious metal was held in


around as princess of her fathers land
a like gold bar above her instep rolld
announced her rank twelve rings were on her hand
her hair was starrd with gems her veils fine fold
below her breast was fastend with a band
of lavish pearls whose worth could scarce be told
her orange silk full turkish trousers furld
about the prettiest ankle in the world


her hairs long auburn waves down to her heel
flowd like an alpine torrent which the sun
dyes with his morning lightand would conceal
her person if allowd at large to run
and still they seem resentfully to feel
the silken fillets curb and sought to shun
their bonds wheneer some zephyr caught began
to offer his young pinion as her fan


round her she made an atmosphere of life
the very air seemd lighter from her eyes
they were so soft and beautiful and rife
with all we can imagine of the skies
and pure as psyche ere she grew a wife
too pure even for the purest human ties
her overpowering presence made you feel
it would not be idolatry to kneel


her eyelashes though dark as night were tinged
it is the countrys custom but in vain
for those large black eyes were so blackly fringed
the glossy rebels mockd the jetty stain
and in their native beauty stood avenged
her nails were touchd with henna but again
the power of art was turnd to nothing for
they could not look more rosy than before


the henna should be deeply dyed to make
the skin relieved appear more fairly fair
she had no need of this day neer will break
on mountain tops more heavenly white than her
the eye might doubt if it were well awake
she was so like a vision i might err
but shakspeare also says t is very silly
to gild refined gold or paint the lily


juan had on a shawl of black and gold
but a white baracan and so transparent
the sparkling gems beneath you might behold
like small stars through the milky way apparent
his turban furld in many a graceful fold
an emerald aigrette with haidees hair in t
surmounted as its claspa glowing crescent
whose rays shone ever trembling but incessant


and now they were diverted by their suite
dwarfs dancing girls black eunuchs and a poet
which made their new establishment complete
the last was of great fame and liked to show it
his verses rarely wanted their due feet
and for his themehe seldom sung below it
he being paid to satirize or flatter
as the psalm says inditing a good matter


he praised the present and abused the past
reversing the good custom of old days
an eastern antijacobin at last
he turnd preferring pudding to no praise
for some few years his lot had been oercast
by his seeming independent in his lays
but now he sung the sultan and the pacha
with truth like southey and with verse like crashaw


he was a man who had seen many changes
and always changed as true as any needle
his polar star being one which rather ranges
and not the fixdhe knew the way to wheedle
so vile he scaped the doom which oft avenges
and being fluent save indeed when feed ill
he lied with such a fervour of intention
there was no doubt he earnd his laureate pension


but he had geniuswhen a turncoat has it
the vates irritabilis takes care
that without notice few full moons shall pass it
even good men like to make the public stare
but to my subjectlet me seewhat was it
othe third cantoand the pretty pair
their loves and feasts and house and dress and mode
of living in their insular abode


their poet a sad trimmer but no less
in company a very pleasant fellow
had been the favourite of full many a mess
of men and made them speeches when half mellow
and though his meaning they could rarely guess
yet still they deignd to hiccup or to bellow
the glorious meed of popular applause
of which the first neer knows the second cause


but now being lifted into high society
and having pickd up several odds and ends
of free thoughts in his travels for variety
he deemd being in a lone isle among friends
that without any danger of a riot he
might for long lying make himself amends
and singing as he sung in his warm youth
agree to a short armistice with truth


he had travelld mongst the arabs turks and franks
and knew the selfloves of the different nations
and having lived with people of all ranks
had something ready upon most occasions
which got him a few presents and some thanks
he varied with some skill his adulations
to do at rome as romans do a piece
of conduct was which he observed in greece


thus usually when he was askd to sing
he gave the different nations something national
t was all the same to himgod save the king
or ca ira according to the fashion all
his muse made increment of any thing
from the high lyric down to the low rational
if pindar sang horseraces what should hinder
himself from being as pliable as pindar


in france for instance he would write a chanson
in england a six canto quarto tale
in spain hed make a ballad or romance on
the last warmuch the same in portugal
in germany the pegasus he d prance on
would be old goethes see what says de stael
in italy he d ape the trecentisti
in greece he sing some sort of hymn like this t ye


the isles of greece the isles of greece
where burning sappho loved and sung
where grew the arts of war and peace
where delos rose and phoebus sprung
eternal summer gilds them yet
but all except their sun is set


the scian and the teian muse
the heros harp the lovers lute
have found the fame your shores refuse
their place of birth alone is mute
to sounds which echo further west
than your sires islands of the blest


the mountains look on marathon
and marathon looks on the sea
and musing there an hour alone
i dreamd that greece might still be free
for standing on the persians grave
i could not deem myself a slave


a king sate on the rocky brow
which looks oer seaborn salamis
and ships by thousands lay below
and men in nationsall were his
he counted them at break of day
and when the sun set where were they


and where are they and where art thou
my country on thy voiceless shore
the heroic lay is tuneless now
the heroic bosom beats no more
and must thy lyre so long divine
degenerate into hands like mine


t is something in the dearth of fame
though linkd among a fetterd race
to feel at least a patriots shame
even as i sing suffuse my face
for what is left the poet here
for greeks a blushfor greece a tear


must we but weep oer days more blest
must we but blushour fathers bled
earth render back from out thy breast
a remnant of our spartan dead
of the three hundred grant but three
to make a new thermopylae


what silent still and silent all
ah nothe voices of the dead
sound like a distant torrents fall
and answer let one living head
but one arisewe come we come
t is but the living who are dumb


in vainin vain strike other chords
fill high the cup with samian wine
leave battles to the turkish hordes
and shed the blood of scios vine
hark rising to the ignoble call
how answers each bold bacchanal


you have the pyrrhic dance as yet
where is the pyrrhic phalanx gone
of two such lessons why forget
the nobler and the manlier one
you have the letters cadmus gave
think ye he meant them for a slave


fill high the bowl with samian wine
we will not think of themes like these
it made anacreons song divine
he servedbut served polycrates
a tyrant but our masters then
were still at least our countrymen


the tyrant of the chersonese
was freedoms best and bravest friend
that tyrant was miltiades
o that the present hour would lend
another despot of the kind
such chains as his were sure to bind


fill high the bowl with samian wine
on sulis rock and pargas shore
exists the remnant of a line
such as the doric mothers bore
and there perhaps some seed is sown
the heracleidan blood might own


trust not for freedom to the franks
they have a king who buys and sells
in native swords and native ranks
the only hope of courage dwells
but turkish force and latin fraud
would break your shield however broad


fill high the bowl with samian wine
our virgins dance beneath the shade
i see their glorious black eyes shine
but gazing on each glowing maid
my own the burning teardrop laves
to think such breasts must suckle slaves


place me on suniums marbled steep
where nothing save the waves and i
may hear our mutual murmurs sweep
there swanlike let me sing and die
a land of slaves shall neer be mine
dash down yon cup of samian wine


thus sung or would or could or should have sung
the modern greek in tolerable verse
if not like orpheus quite when greece was young
yet in these times he might have done much worse
his strain displayd some feelingright or wrong
and feeling in a poet is the source
of others feeling but they are such liars
and take all colourslike the hands of dyers


but words are things and a small drop of ink
falling like dew upon a thought produces
that which makes thousands perhaps millions think
t is strange the shortest letter which man uses
instead of speech may form a lasting link
of ages to what straits old time reduces
frail man when papereven a rag like this
survives himself his tomb and all that s his


and when his bones are dust his grave a blank
his station generation even his nation
become a thing or nothing save to rank
in chronological commemoration
some dull ms oblivion long has sank
or graven stone found in a barracks station
in digging the foundation of a closet
may turn his name up as a rare deposit


and glory long has made the sages smile
t is something nothing words illusion wind
depending more upon the historians style
than on the name a person leaves behind
troy owes to homer what whist owes to hoyle
the present century was growing blind
to the great marlboroughs skill in giving knocks
until his late life by archdeacon coxe


milton s the prince of poetsso we say
a little heavy but no less divine
an independent being in his day
learnd pious temperate in love and wine
but his life falling into johnsons way
we re told this great high priest of all the nine
was whipt at collegea harsh sireodd spouse
for the first mrs milton left his house


all these are certes entertaining facts
like shakspeares stealing deer lord bacons bribes
like titus youth and caesars earliest acts
like burns whom doctor currie well describes
like cromwells pranksbut although truth exacts
these amiable descriptions from the scribes
as most essential to their heros story
they do not much contribute to his glory


all are not moralists like southey when
he prated to the world of pantisocracy
or wordsworth unexcised unhired who then
seasond his pedlar poems with democracy
or coleridge long before his flighty pen
let to the morning post its aristocracy
when he and southey following the same path
espoused two partners milliners of bath


such names at present cut a convict figure
the very botany bay in moral geography
their loyal treason renegado rigour
are good manure for their more bare biography
wordsworths last quarto by the way is bigger
than any since the birthday of typography
a drowsy frowzy poem calld the excursion
writ in a manner which is my aversion


he there builds up a formidable dyke
between his own and others intellect
but wordsworths poem and his followers like
joanna southcotes shiloh and her sect
are things which in this century dont strike
the public mindso few are the elect
and the new births of both their stale virginities
have proved but dropsies taken for divinities


but let me to my story i must own
if i have any fault it is digression
leaving my people to proceed alone
while i soliloquize beyond expression
but these are my addresses from the throne
which put off business to the ensuing session
forgetting each omission is a loss to
the world not quite so great as ariosto


i know that what our neighbours call longueurs
we ve not so good a word but have the thing
in that complete perfection which ensures
an epic from bob southey every spring
form not the true temptation which allures
the reader but t would not be hard to bring
some fine examples of the epopee
to prove its grand ingredient is ennui


we learn from horace homer sometimes sleeps
we feel without him wordsworth sometimes wakes
to show with what complacency he creeps
with his dear waggoners around his lakes
he wishes for a boat to sail the deeps
of oceanno of air and then he makes
another outcry for a little boat
and drivels seas to set it well afloat


if he must fain sweep oer the ethereal plain
and pegasus runs restive in his waggon
could he not beg the loan of charless wain
or pray medea for a single dragon
or if too classic for his vulgar brain
he feard his neck to venture such a nag on
and he must needs mount nearer to the moon
could not the blockhead ask for a balloon


pedlars and boats and waggons oh ye shades
of pope and dryden are we come to this
that trash of such sort not alone evades
contempt but from the bathos vast abyss
floats scumlike uppermost and these jack cades
of sense and song above your graves may hiss
the little boatman and his peter bell
can sneer at him who drew achitophel


t our talethe feast was over the slaves gone
the dwarfs and dancing girls had all retired
the arab lore and poets song were done
and every sound of revelry expired
the lady and her lover left alone
the rosy flood of twilights sky admired
ave maria oer the earth and sea
that heavenliest hour of heaven is worthiest thee


ave maria blessed be the hour
the time the clime the spot where i so oft
have felt that moment in its fullest power
sink oer the earth so beautiful and soft
while swung the deep bell in the distant tower
or the faint dying dayhymn stole aloft
and not a breath crept through the rosy air
and yet the forest leaves seemd stirrd with prayer


ave maria t is the hour of prayer
ave maria t is the hour of love
ave maria may our spirits dare
look up to thine and to thy sons above
ave maria oh that face so fair
those downcast eyes beneath the almighty dove
what though t is but a pictured imagestrike
that painting is no idolt is too like


some kinder casuists are pleased to say
in nameless printthat i have no devotion
but set those persons down with me to pray
and you shall see who has the properest notion
of getting into heaven the shortest way
my altars are the mountains and the ocean
earth air starsall that springs from the great whole
who hath produced and will receive the soul


sweet hour of twilightin the solitude
of the pine forest and the silent shore
which bounds ravennas immemorial wood
rooted where once the adrian wave flowd oer
to where the last caesarean fortress stood
evergreen forest which boccaccios lore
and drydens lay made haunted ground to me
how have i loved the twilight hour and thee


the shrill cicadas people of the pine
making their summer lives one ceaseless song
were the sole echoes save my steeds and mine
and vesper bells that rose the boughs along
the spectre huntsman of onestis line
his helldogs and their chase and the fair throng
which learnd from this example not to fly
from a true lovershadowd my minds eye


o hesperus thou bringest all good things
home to the weary to the hungry cheer
to the young bird the parents brooding wings
the welcome stall to the oerlabourd steer
whateer of peace about our hearthstone clings
whateer our household gods protect of dear
are gatherd round us by thy look of rest
thou bringst the child too to the mothers breast


soft hour which wakes the wish and melts the heart
of those who sail the seas on the first day
when they from their sweet friends are torn apart
or fills with love the pilgrim on his way
as the far bell of vesper makes him start
seeming to weep the dying days decay
is this a fancy which our reason scorns
ah surely nothing dies but something mourns


when nero perishd by the justest doom
which ever the destroyer yet destroyd
amidst the roar of liberated rome
of nations freed and the world overjoyd
some hands unseen strewd flowers upon his tomb
perhaps the weakness of a heart not void
of feeling for some kindness done when power
had left the wretch an uncorrupted hour


but i m digressing what on earth has nero
or any such like sovereign buffoons
to do with the transactions of my hero
more than such madmens fellow manthe moons
sure my invention must be down at zero
and i grown one of many wooden spoons
of verse the name with which we cantabs please
to dub the last of honours in degrees


i feel this tediousness will never do
t is being too epic and i must cut down
in copying this long canto into two
they ll never find it out unless i own
the fact excepting some experienced few
and then as an improvement t will be shown
i ll prove that such the opinion of the critic is
from aristotle passimsee poietikes


nothing so difficult as a beginning
in poesy unless perhaps the end
for oftentimes when pegasus seems winning
the race he sprains a wing and down we tend
like lucifer when hurld from heaven for sinning
our sin the same and hard as his to mend
being pride which leads the mind to soar too far
till our own weakness shows us what we are


but time which brings all beings to their level
and sharp adversity will teach at last
manand as we would hopeperhaps the devil
that neither of their intellects are vast
while youths hot wishes in our red veins revel
we know not thisthe blood flows on too fast
but as the torrent widens towards the ocean
we ponder deeply on each past emotion


as boy i thought myself a clever fellow
and wishd that others held the same opinion
they took it up when my days grew more mellow
and other minds acknowledged my dominion
now my sere fancy falls into the yellow
leaf and imagination droops her pinion
and the sad truth which hovers oer my desk
turns what was once romantic to burlesque


and if i laugh at any mortal thing
t is that i may not weep and if i weep
t is that our nature cannot always bring
itself to apathy for we must steep
our hearts first in the depths of lethes spring
ere what we least wish to behold will sleep
thetis baptized her mortal son in styx
a mortal mother would on lethe fix


some have accused me of a strange design
against the creed and morals of the land
and trace it in this poem every line
i dont pretend that i quite understand
my own meaning when i would be very fine
but the fact is that i have nothing plannd
unless it were to be a moment merry
a novel word in my vocabulary


to the kind reader of our sober clime
this way of writing will appear exotic
pulci was sire of the halfserious rhyme
who sang when chivalry was more quixotic
and revelld in the fancies of the time
true knights chaste dames huge giants kings despotic
but all these save the last being obsolete
i chose a modern subject as more meet


how i have treated it i do not know
perhaps no better than they have treated me
who have imputed such designs as show
not what they saw but what they wishd to see
but if it gives them pleasure be it so
this is a liberal age and thoughts are free
meantime apollo plucks me by the ear
and tells me to resume my story here


young juan and his ladylove were left
to their own hearts most sweet society
even time the pitiless in sorrow cleft
with his rude scythe such gentle bosoms he
sighd to behold them of their hours bereft
though foe to love and yet they could not be
meant to grow old but die in happy spring
before one charm or hope had taken wing


their faces were not made for wrinkles their
pure blood to stagnate their great hearts to fail
the blank grey was not made to blast their hair
but like the climes that know nor snow nor hail
they were all summer lightning might assail
and shiver them to ashes but to trail
a long and snakelike life of dull decay
was not for themthey had too little day


they were alone once more for them to be
thus was another eden they were never
weary unless when separate the tree
cut from its forest root of yearsthe river
dammd from its fountainthe child from the knee
and breast maternal weand at once for ever
would wither less than these two torn apart
alas there is no instinct like the heart


the heartwhich may be broken happy they
thrice fortunate who of that fragile mould
the precious porcelain of human clay
break with the first fall they can neer behold
the long year linkd with heavy day on day
and all which must be borne and never told
while lifes strange principle will often lie
deepest in those who long the most to die


whom the gods love die young was said of yore
and many deaths do they escape by this
the death of friends and that which slays even more
the death of friendship love youth all that is
except mere breath and since the silent shore
awaits at last even those who longest miss
the old archers shafts perhaps the early grave
which men weep over may be meant to save


haidee and juan thought not of the dead
the heavens and earth and air seemd made for them
they found no fault with time save that he fled
they saw not in themselves aught to condemn
each was the others mirror and but read
joy sparkling in their dark eyes like a gem
and knew such brightness was but the reflection
of their exchanging glances of affection


the gentle pressure and the thrilling touch
the least glance better understood than words
which still said all and neer could say too much
a language too but like to that of birds
known but to them at least appearing such
as but to lovers a true sense affords
sweet playful phrases which would seem absurd
to those who have ceased to hear such or neer heard


all these were theirs for they were children still
and children still they should have ever been
they were not made in the real world to fill
a busy character in the dull scene
but like two beings born from out a rill
a nymph and her beloved all unseen
to pass their lives in fountains and on flowers
and never know the weight of human hours


moons changing had rolld on and changeless found
those their bright rise had lighted to such joys
as rarely they beheld throughout their round
and these were not of the vain kind which cloys
for theirs were buoyant spirits never bound
by the mere senses and that which destroys
most love possession unto them appeard
a thing which each endearment more endeard


o beautiful and rare as beautiful
but theirs was love in which the mind delights
to lose itself when the old world grows dull
and we are sick of its hack sounds and sights
intrigues adventures of the common school
its petty passions marriages and flights
where hymens torch but brands one strumpet more
whose husband only knows her not a whre


hard words harsh truth a truth which many know
enoughthe faithful and the fairy pair
who never found a single hour too slow
what was it made them thus exempt from care
young innate feelings all have felt below
which perish in the rest but in them were
inherentwhat we mortals call romantic
and always envy though we deem it frantic


this is in others a factitious state
an opium dream of too much youth and reading
but was in them their nature or their fate
no novels eer had set their young hearts bleeding
for haidees knowledge was by no means great
and juan was a boy of saintly breeding
so that there was no reason for their loves
more than for those of nightingales or doves


they gazed upon the sunset t is an hour
dear unto all but dearest to their eyes
for it had made them what they were the power
of love had first oerwhelmd them from such skies
when happiness had been their only dower
and twilight saw them linkd in passions ties
charmd with each other all things charmd that brought
the past still welcome as the present thought


i know not why but in that hour tonight
even as they gazed a sudden tremor came
and swept as t were across their hearts delight
like the wind oer a harpstring or a flame
when one is shook in sound and one in sight
and thus some boding flashd through either frame
and calld from juans breast a faint low sigh
while one new tear arose in haidees eye


that large black prophet eye seemd to dilate
and follow far the disappearing sun
as if their last day of a happy date
with his broad bright and dropping orb were gone
juan gazed on her as to ask his fate
he felt a grief but knowing cause for none
his glance inquired of hers for some excuse
for feelings causeless or at least abstruse


she turnd to him and smiled but in that sort
which makes not others smile then turnd aside
whatever feeling shook her it seemd short
and masterd by her wisdom or her pride
when juan spoke tooit might be in sport
of this their mutual feeling she replied
if it should be sobutit cannot be
or i at least shall not survive to see


juan would question further but she pressd
his lip to hers and silenced him with this
and then dismissd the omen from her breast
defying augury with that fond kiss
and no doubt of all methods t is the best
some people prefer winet is not amiss
i have tried both so those who would a part take
may choose between the headache and the heartache


one of the two according to your choice
woman or wine you ll have to undergo
both maladies are taxes on our joys
but which to choose i really hardly know
and if i had to give a casting voice
for both sides i could many reasons show
and then decide without great wrong to either
it were much better to have both than neither


juan and haidee gazed upon each other
with swimming looks of speechless tenderness
which mixd all feelings friend child lover brother
all that the best can mingle and express
when two pure hearts are pourd in one another
and love too much and yet can not love less
but almost sanctify the sweet excess
by the immortal wish and power to bless


mixd in each others arms and heart in heart
why did they not then diethey had lived too long
should an hour come to bid them breathe apart
years could but bring them cruel things or wrong
the world was not for them nor the worlds art
for beings passionate as sapphos song
love was born with them in them so intense
it was their very spiritnot a sense


they should have lived together deep in woods
unseen as sings the nightingale they were
unfit to mix in these thick solitudes
calld social haunts of hate and vice and care
how lonely every freeborn creature broods
the sweetest songbirds nestle in a pair
the eagle soars alone the gull and crow
flock oer their carrion just like men below


now pillowd cheek to cheek in loving sleep
haidee and juan their siesta took
a gentle slumber but it was not deep
for ever and anon a something shook
juan and shuddering oer his frame would creep
and haidees sweet lips murmurd like a brook
a wordless music and her face so fair
stirrd with her dream as roseleaves with the air


or as the stirring of a deep dear stream
within an alpine hollow when the wind
walks oer it was she shaken by the dream
the mystical usurper of the mind
oerpowering us to be whateer may seem
good to the soul which we no more can bind
strange state of being for t is still to be
senseless to feel and with seald eyes to see


she dreamd of being alone on the seashore
chaind to a rock she knew not how but stir
she could not from the spot and the loud roar
grew and each wave rose roughly threatening her
and oer her upper lip they seemd to pour
until she sobbd for breath and soon they were
foaming oer her lone head so fierce and high
each broke to drown her yet she could not die


anonshe was released and then she strayd
oer the sharp shingles with her bleeding feet
and stumbled almost every step she made
and something rolld before her in a sheet
which she must still pursue howeer afraid
t was white and indistinct nor stoppd to meet
her glance nor grasp for still she gazed and graspd
and ran but it escaped her as she claspd


the dream changedin a cave she stood its walls
were hung with marble icicles the work
of ages on its waterfretted halls
where waves might wash and seals might breed and lurk
her hair was dripping and the very balls
of her black eyes seemd turnd to tears and mirk
the sharp rocks lookd below each drop they caught
which froze to marble as it fellshe thought


and wet and cold and lifeless at her feet
pale as the foam that frothd on his dead brow
which she essayd in vain to clear how sweet
were once her cares how idle seemd they now
lay juan nor could aught renew the beat
of his quenchd heart and the sea dirges low
rang in her sad ears like a mermaids song
and that brief dream appeard a life too long


and gazing on the dead she thought his face
faded or alterd into something new
like to her fathers features till each trace
more like and like to lambros aspect grew
with all his keen worn look and grecian grace
and starting she awoke and what to view
o powers of heaven what dark eye meets she there
t ist is her fathersfixd upon the pair


then shrieking she arose and shrieking fell
with joy and sorrow hope and fear to see
him whom she deemd a habitant where dwell
the oceanburied risen from death to be
perchance the death of one she loved too well
dear as her father had been to haidee
it was a moment of that awful kind
i have seen suchbut must not call to mind


up juan sprung to haidees bitter shriek
and caught her falling and from off the wall
snatchd down his sabre in hot haste to wreak
vengeance on him who was the cause of all
then lambro who till now forbore to speak
smiled scornfully and said within my call
a thousand scimitars await the word
put up young man put up your silly sword


and haidee clung around him juan t is
t is lambrot is my father kneel with me
he will forgive usyesit must beyes
o dearest father in this agony
of pleasure and of paineven while i kiss
thy garments hem with transport can it be
that doubt should mingle with my filial joy
deal with me as thou wilt but spare this boy


high and inscrutable the old man stood
calm in his voice and calm within his eye
not always signs with him of calmest mood
he lookd upon her but gave no reply
then turnd to juan in whose cheek the blood
oft came and went as there resolved to die
in arms at least he stood in act to spring
on the first foe whom lambros call might bring


young man your sword so lambro once more said
juan replied not while this arm is free
the old mans cheek grew pale but not with dread
and drawing from his belt a pistol he
replied your blood be then on your own head
then lookd dose at the flint as if to see
t was freshfor he had lately used the lock
and next proceeded quietly to cock


it has a strange quick jar upon the ear
that cocking of a pistol when you know
a moment more will bring the sight to bear
upon your person twelve yards off or so
a gentlemanly distance not too near
if you have got a former friend for foe
but after being fired at once or twice
the ear becomes more irish and less nice


lambro presented and one instant more
had stoppd this canto and don juans breath
when haidee threw herself her boy before
stern as her sire on me she cried let death
descendthe fault is mine this fatal shore
he foundbut sought not i have pledged my faith
i love himi will die with him i knew
your natures firmnessknow your daughters too


a minute past and she had been all tears
and tenderness and infancy but now
she stood as one who championd human fears
pale statuelike and stern she wood the blow
and tall beyond her sex and their compeers
she drew up to her height as if to show
a fairer mark and with a fixd eye scannd
her fathers facebut never stoppd his hand


he gazed on her and she on him t was strange
how like they lookd the expression was the same
serenely savage with a little change
in the large dark eyes mutualdarted flame
for she too was as one who could avenge
if cause should bea lioness though tame
her fathers blood before her fathers face
boild up and proved her truly of his race


i said they were alike their features and
their stature differing but in sex and years
even to the delicacy of their hand
there was resemblance such as true blood wears
and now to see them thus divided stand
in fixd ferocity when joyous tears
and sweet sensations should have welcomed both
show what the passions are in their full growth


the father paused a moment then withdrew
his weapon and replaced it but stood still
and looking on her as to look her through
not i he said have sought this strangers ill
not i have made this desolation few
would bear such outrage and forbear to kill
but i must do my dutyhow thou hast
done thine the present vouches for the past


let him disarm or by my fathers head
his own shall roll before you like a ball
he raised his whistle as the word he said
and blew another answerd to the call
and rushing in disorderly though led
and armd from boot to turban one and all
some twenty of his train came rank on rank
he gave the wordarrest or slay the frank


then with a sudden movement he withdrew
his daughter while compressd within his clasp
twixt her and juan interposed the crew
in vain she struggled in her fathers grasp
his arms were like a serpents coil then flew
upon their prey as darts an angry asp
the file of pirates save the foremost who
had fallen with his right shoulder half cut through


the second had his cheek laid open but
the third a wary cool old sworder took
the blows upon his cutlass and then put
his own well in so well ere you could look
his man was floord and helpless at his foot
with the blood running like a little brook
from two smart sabre gashes deep and red
one on the arm the other on the head


and then they bound him where he fell and bore
juan from the apartment with a sign
old lambro bade them take him to the shore
where lay some ships which were to sail at nine
they laid him in a boat and plied the oar
until they reachd some galliots placed in line
on board of one of these and under hatches
they stowd him with strict orders to the watches


the world is full of strange vicissitudes
and here was one exceedingly unpleasant
a gentleman so rich in the worlds goods
handsome and young enjoying all the present
just at the very time when he least broods
on such a thing is suddenly to sea sent
wounded and chaind so that he cannot move
and all because a lady fell in love


here i must leave him for i grow pathetic
moved by the chinese nymph of tears green tea
than whom cassandra was not more prophetic
for if my pure libations exceed three
i feel my heart become so sympathetic
that i must have recourse to black bohea
t is pity wine should be so deleterious
for tea and coffee leave us much more serious


unless when qualified with thee cogniac
sweet naiad of the phlegethontic rill
ah why the liver wilt thou thus attack
and make like other nymphs thy lovers ill
i would take refuge in weak punch but rack
in each sense of the word wheneer i fill
my mild and midnight beakers to the brim
wakes me next morning with its synonym


i leave don juan for the present safe
not sound poor fellow but severely wounded
yet could his corporal pangs amount to half
of those with which his haidees bosom bounded
she was not one to weep and rave and chafe
and then give way subdued because surrounded
her mother was a moorish maid from fez
where all is eden or a wilderness


there the large olive rains its amber store
in marble fonts there grain and flower and fruit
gush from the earth until the land runs oer
but there too many a poisontree has root
and midnight listens to the lions roar
and long long deserts scorch the camels foot
or heaving whelm the helpless caravan
and as the soil is so the heart of man


afric is all the suns and as her earth
her human day is kindled full of power
for good or evil burning from its birth
the moorish blood partakes the planets hour
and like the soil beneath it will bring forth
beauty and love were haidees mothers dower
but her large dark eye showd deep passions force
though sleeping like a lion near a source


her daughter temperd with a milder ray
like summer clouds all silvery smooth and fair
till slowly charged with thunder they display
terror to earth and tempest to the air
had held till now her soft and milky way
but overwrought with passion and despair
the fire burst forth from her numidian veins
even as the simoom sweeps the blasted plains


the last sight which she saw was juans gore
and he himself oermasterd and cut down
his blood was running on the very floor
where late he trod her beautiful her own
thus much she viewd an instant and no more
her struggles ceased with one convulsive groan
on her sires arm which until now scarce held
her writhing fell she like a cedar felld


a vein had burst and her sweet lips pure dyes
were dabbled with the deep blood which ran oer
and her head droopd as when the lily lies
oercharged with rain her summond handmaids bore
their lady to her couch with gushing eyes
of herbs and cordials they produced their store
but she defied all means they could employ
like one life could not hold nor death destroy


days lay she in that state unchanged though chill
with nothing livid still her lips were red
she had no pulse but death seemd absent still
no hideous sign proclaimd her surely dead
corruption came not in each mind to kill
all hope to look upon her sweet face bred
new thoughts of life for it seemd full of soul
she had so much earth could not claim the whole


the ruling passion such as marble shows
when exquisitely chiselld still lay there
but fixd as marbles unchanged aspect throws
oer the fair venus but for ever fair
oer the laocoons all eternal throes
and everdying gladiators air
their energy like life forms all their fame
yet looks not life for they are still the same


she woke at length but not as sleepers wake
rather the dead for life seemd something new
a strange sensation which she must partake
perforce since whatsoever met her view
struck not on memory though a heavy ache
lay at her heart whose earliest beat still true
brought back the sense of pain without the cause
for for a while the furies made a pause


she lookd on many a face with vacant eye
on many a token without knowing what
she saw them watch her without asking why
and reckd not who around her pillow sat
not speechless though she spoke not not a sigh
relieved her thoughts dull silence and quick chat
were tried in vain by those who served she gave
no sign save breath of having left the grave


her handmaids tended but she heeded not
her father watchd she turnd her eyes away
she recognized no being and no spot
however dear or cherishd in their day
they changed from room to roombut all forgot
gentle but without memory she lay
at length those eyes which they would fain be weaning
back to old thoughts waxd full of fearful meaning


and then a slave bethought her of a harp
the harper came and tuned his instrument
at the first notes irregular and sharp
on him her flashing eyes a moment bent
then to the wall she turnd as if to warp
her thoughts from sorrow through her heart resent
and he begun a long low island song
of ancient days ere tyranny grew strong


anon her thin wan fingers beat the wall
in time to his old tune he changed the theme
and sung of love the fierce name struck through all
her recollection on her flashd the dream
of what she was and is if ye could call
to be so being in a gushing stream
the tears rushd forth from her oerclouded brain
like mountain mists at length dissolved in rain


short solace vain reliefthought came too quick
and whirld her brain to madness she arose
as one who neer had dwelt among the sick
and flew at all she met as on her foes
but no one ever heard her speak or shriek
although her paroxysm drew towards its dose
hers was a phrensy which disdaind to rave
even when they smote her in the hope to save


yet she betrayd at times a gleam of sense
nothing could make her meet her fathers face
though on all other things with looks intense
she gazed but none she ever could retrace
food she refused and raiment no pretence
availd for either neither change of place
nor time nor skill nor remedy could give her
senses to sleepthe power seemd gone for ever


twelve days and nights she witherd thus at last
without a groan or sigh or glance to show
a parting pang the spirit from her past
and they who watchd her nearest could not know
the very instant till the change that cast
her sweet face into shadow dull and slow
glazed oer her eyesthe beautiful the black
o to possess such lustreand then lack


she died but not alone she held within
a second principle of life which might
have dawnd a fair and sinless child of sin
but closed its little being without light
and went down to the grave unborn wherein
blossom and bough lie witherd with one blight
in vain the dews of heaven descend above
the bleeding flower and blasted fruit of love


thus livedthus died she never more on her
shall sorrow light or shame she was not made
through years or moons the inner weight to bear
which colder hearts endure till they are laid
by age in earth her days and pleasures were
brief but delightfulsuch as had not staid
long with her destiny but she sleeps well
by the seashore whereon she loved to dwell


that isle is now all desolate and bare
its dwellings down its tenants passd away
none but her own and fathers grave is there
and nothing outward tells of human clay
ye could not know where lies a thing so fair
no stone is there to show no tongue to say
what was no dirge except the hollow seas
mourns oer the beauty of the cyclades


but many a greek maid in a loving song
sighs oer her name and many an islander
with her sires story makes the night less long
valour was his and beauty dwelt with her
if she loved rashly her life paid for wrong
a heavy price must all pay who thus err
in some shape let none think to fly the danger
for soon or late love is his own avenger


but let me change this theme which grows too sad
and lay this sheet of sorrows on the shelf
i dont much like describing people mad
for fear of seeming rather touchd myself
besides i ve no more on this head to add
and as my muse is a capricious elf
we ll put about and try another tack
with juan left halfkilld some stanzas back


wounded and fetterd cabind cribbd confined
some days and nights elapsed before that he
could altogether call the past to mind
and when he did he found himself at sea
sailing six knots an hour before the wind
the shores of ilion lay beneath their lee
another time he might have liked to see em
but now was not much pleased with cape sigaeum


there on the green and villagecotted hill is
flankd by the hellespont and by the sea
entombd the bravest of the brave achilles
they say so bryant says the contrary
and further downward tall and towering still is
the tumulusof whom heaven knows t may be
patroclus ajax or protesilaus
all heroes who if living still would slay us


high barrows without marble or a name
a vast untilld and mountainskirted plain
and ida in the distance still the same
and old scamander if t is he remain
the situation seems still formd for fame
a hundred thousand men might fight again
with case but where i sought for ilions walls
the quiet sheep feeds and the tortoise crawls


troops of untended horses here and there
some little hamlets with new names uncouth
some shepherds unlike paris led to stare
a moment at the european youth
whom to the spot their schoolboy feelings bear
a turk with beads in hand and pipe in mouth
extremely taken with his own religion
are what i found therebut the devil a phrygian


don juan here permitted to emerge
from his dull cabin found himself a slave
forlorn and gazing on the deep blue surge
oershadowd there by many a heros grave
weak still with loss of blood he scarce could urge
a few brief questions and the answers gave
no very satisfactory information
about his past or present situation


he saw some fellow captives who appeard
to be italians as they were in fact
from them at least their destiny he heard
which was an odd one a troop going to act
in sicily all singers duly reard
in their vocation had not been attackd
in sailing from livorno by the pirate
but sold by the impresario at no high rate


by one of these the buffo of the party
juan was told about their curious case
for although destined to the turkish mart he
still kept his spirits upat least his face
the little fellow really lookd quite hearty
and bore him with some gaiety and grace
showing a much more reconciled demeanour
than did the prima donna and the tenor


in a few words he told their hapless story
saying our machiavellian impresario
making a signal off some promontory
haild a strange brigcorpo di caio mario
we were transferrd on board her in a hurry
without a single scudo of salario
but if the sultan has a taste for song
we will revive our fortunes before long


the prima donna though a little old
and haggard with a dissipated life
and subject when the house is thin to cold
has some good notes and then the tenors wife
with no great voice is pleasing to behold
last carnival she made a deal of strife
by carrying off count cesare cicogna
from an old roman princess at bologna


and then there are the dancers there s the nini
with more than one profession gains by all
then there s that laughing slut the pelegrini
she too was fortunate last carnival
and made at least five hundred good zecchini
but spends so fast she has not now a paul
and then there s the grotescasuch a dancer
where men have souls or bodies she must answer


as for the figuranti they are like
the rest of all that tribe with here and there
a pretty person which perhaps may strike
the rest are hardly fitted for a fair
there s one though tall and stiffer than a pike
yet has a sentimental kind of air
which might go far but she dont dance with vigour
the more s the pity with her face and figure


as for the men they are a middling set
the musico is but a crackd old basin
but being qualified in one way yet
may the seraglio do to set his face in
and as a servant some preferment get
his singing i no further trust can place in
from all the pope makes yearly t would perplex
to find three perfect pipes of the third sex


the tenors voice is spoilt by affectation
and for the bass the beast can only bellow
in fact he had no singing education
an ignorant noteless timeless tuneless fellow
but being the prima donnas near relation
who swore his voice was very rich and mellow
they hired him though to hear him you d believe
an ass was practising recitative


t would not become myself to dwell upon
my own merits and though youngi see siryou
have got a travelld air which speaks you one
to whom the opera is by no means new
you ve heard of raucocantii m the man
the time may come when you may hear me too
you was not last year at the fair of lugo
but next when i m engaged to sing theredo go


our baritone i almost had forgot
a pretty lad but bursting with conceit
with graceful action science not a jot
a voice of no great compass and not sweet
he always is complaining of his lot
forsooth scarce fit for ballads in the street
in lovers parts his passion more to breathe
having no heart to show he shows his teeth


here raucocantis eloquent recital
was interrupted by the pirate crew
who came at stated moments to invite all
the captives back to their sad berths each threw
a rueful glance upon the waves which bright all
from the blue skies derived a double blue
dancing all free and happy in the sun
and then went down the hatchway one by one


they heard next daythat in the dardanelles
waiting for his sublimitys firman
the most imperative of sovereign spells
which every body does without who can
more to secure them in their naval cells
lady to lady well as man to man
were to be chaind and lotted out per couple
for the slave market of constantinople


it seems when this allotment was made out
there chanced to be an odd male and odd female
who after some discussion and some doubt
if the soprano might be deemd to be male
they placed him oer the women as a scout
were linkd together and it happend the male
was juanwho an awkward thing at his age
paird off with a bacchante blooming visage


with raucocanti lucklessly was chaind
the tenor these two hated with a hate
found only on the stage and each more paind
with this his tuneful neighbour than his fate
sad strife arose for they were so crossgraind
instead of bearing up without debate
that each pulld different ways with many an oath
arcades ambo id estblackguards both


juans companion was a romagnole
but bred within the march of old ancona
with eyes that lookd into the very soul
and other chief points of a bella donna
brightand as black and burning as a coal
and through her dear brunette complexion shone
great wish to pleasea most attractive dower
especially when added to the power


but all that power was wasted upon him
for sorrow oer each sense held stern command
her eye might flash on his but found it dim
and though thus chaind as natural her hand
touchd his nor thatnor any handsome limb
and she had some not easy to withstand
could stir his pulse or make his faith feel brittle
perhaps his recent wounds might help a little


no matter we should neer too much enquire
but facts are facts no knight could be more true
and firmer faith no ladyelove desire
we will omit the proofs save one or two
t is said no one in hand can hold a fire
by thought of frosty caucasus but few
i really think yet juans then ordeal
was more triumphant and not much less real


here i might enter on a chaste description
having withstood temptation in my youth
but hear that several people take exception
at the first two books having too much truth
therefore i ll make don juan leave the ship soon
because the publisher declares in sooth
through needles eyes it easier for the camel is
to pass than those two cantos into families


t is all the same to me i m fond of yielding
and therefore leave them to the purer page
of smollett prior ariosto fielding
who say strange things for so correct an age
i once had great alacrity in wielding
my pen and liked poetic war to wage
and recollect the time when all this cant
would have provoked remarks which now it shant


as boys love rows my boyhood liked a squabble
but at this hour i wish to part in peace
leaving such to the literary rabble
whether my verses fame be doomd to cease
while the right hand which wrote it still is able
or of some centuries to take a lease
the grass upon my grave will grow as long
and sigh to midnight winds but not to song


of poets who come down to us through distance
of time and tongues the fosterbabes of fame
life seems the smallest portion of existence
where twenty ages gather oer a name
t is as a snowball which derives assistance
from every flake and yet rolls on the same
even till an iceberg it may chance to grow
but after all t is nothing but cold snow


and so great names are nothing more than nominal
and love of glory s but an airy lust
too often in its fury overcoming all
who would as t were identify their dust
from out the wide destruction which entombing all
leaves nothing till the coming of the just
save change i ve stood upon achilles tomb
and heard troy doubted time will doubt of rome


the very generations of the dead
are swept away and tomb inherits tomb
until the memory of an age is fled
and buried sinks beneath its offsprings doom
where are the epitaphs our fathers read
save a few gleand from the sepulchral gloom
which oncenamed myriads nameless lie beneath
and lose their own in universal death


i canter by the spot each afternoon
where perishd in his fame the heroboy
who lived too long for men but died too soon
for human vanity the young de foix
a broken pillar not uncouthly hewn
but which neglect is hastening to destroy
records ravennas carnage on its face
while weeds and ordure rankle round the base


i pass each day where dantes bones are laid
a little cupola more neat than solemn
protects his dust but reverence here is paid
to the bards tomb and not the warriors column
the time must come when both alike decayd
the chieftains trophy and the poets volume
will sink where lie the songs and wars of earth
before pelides death or homers birth


with human blood that column was cemented
with human filth that column is defiled
as if the peasants coarse contempt were vented
to show his loathing of the spot he soild
thus is the trophy used and thus lamented
should ever be those bloodhounds from whose wild
instinct of gore and glory earth has known
those sufferings dante saw in hell alone


yet there will still be bards though fame is smoke
its fumes are frankincense to human thought
and the unquiet feelings which first woke
song in the world will seek what then they sought
as on the beach the waves at last are broke
thus to their extreme verge the passions brought
dash into poetry which is but passion
or at least was so ere it grew a fashion


if in the course of such a life as was
at once adventurous and contemplative
men who partake all passions as they pass
acquire the deep and bitter power to give
their images again as in a glass
and in such colours that they seem to live
you may do right forbidding them to show em
but spoil i think a very pretty poem


o ye who make the fortunes of all books
benign ceruleans of the second sex
who advertise new poems by your looks
your imprimatur will ye not annex
what must i go to the oblivious cooks
those cornish plunderers of parnassian wrecks
ah must i then the only minstrel be
proscribed from tasting your castalian tea


what can i prove a lion then no more
a ballroom bard a foolscap hotpress darling
to bear the compliments of many a bore
and sigh i cant get out like yoricks starling
why then i ll swear as poet wordy swore
because the world wont read him always snarling
that taste is gone that fame is but a lottery
drawn by the bluecoat misses of a coterie


o darkly deeply beautifully blue
as some one somewhere sings about the sky
and i ye learned ladies say of you
they say your stockings are so heaven knows why
i have examined few pair of that hue
blue as the garters which serenely lie
round the patrician leftlegs which adorn
the festal midnight and the levee morn


yet some of you are most seraphic creatures
but times are alterd since a rhyming lover
you read my stanzas and i read your features
andbut no matter all those things are over
still i have no dislike to learned natures
for sometimes such a world of virtues cover
i knew one woman of that purple school
the loveliest chastest best butquite a fool


humboldt the first of travellers but not
the last if late accounts be accurate
invented by some name i have forgot
as well as the sublime discoverys date
an airy instrument with which he sought
to ascertain the atmospheric state
by measuring the intensity of blue
o lady daphne let me measure you


but to the narrativethe vessel bound
with slaves to sell off in the capital
after the usual process might be found
at anchor under the seraglio wall
her cargo from the plague being safe and sound
were landed in the market one and all
and there with georgians russians and circassians
bought up for different purposes and passions


some went off dearly fifteen hundred dollars
for one circassian a sweet girl were given
warranted virgin beautys brightest colours
had deckd her out in all the hues of heaven
her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers
who bade on till the hundreds reachd eleven
but when the offer went beyond they knew
t was for the sultan and at once withdrew


twelve negresses from nubia brought a price
which the west indian market scarce would bring
though wilberforce at last has made it twice
what t was ere abolition and the thing
need not seem very wonderful for vice
is always much more splendid than a king
the virtues even the most exalted charity
are savingvice spares nothing for a rarity


but for the destiny of this young troop
how some were bought by pachas some by jews
how some to burdens were obliged to stoop
and others rose to the command of crews
as renegadoes while in hapless group
hoping no very old vizier might choose
the females stood as one by one they pickd em
to make a mistress or fourth wife or victim


all this must be reserved for further song
also our heros lot howeer unpleasant
because this canto has become too long
must be postponed discreetly for the present
i m sensible redundancy is wrong
but could not for the muse of me put less in t
and now delay the progress of don juan
till what is calld in ossian the fifth juan


she walks in beauty like the night
of cloudless climes and starry skies
and all thats best of dark and bright
meet in her aspect and her eyes
thus mellowd to that tender light
which heaven to gaudy day denies


one shade the more one ray the less
had half impaird the nameless grace
which waves in every raven tress
or softly lightens oer her face
where thoughts serenely sweet express
how pure how dear their dwellingplace


and on that cheek and oer that brow
so soft so calm yet eloquent
the smiles that win the tints that glow
but tell of days in goodness spent
a mind at peace with all below
a heart whose love is innocent


o snatchd away in beautys bloom
on thee shall press no ponderous tomb
but on thy turf shall roses rear
their leaves the earliest of the year
and the wild cypress wave in tender gloom


and oft by yon blue gushing stream
shall sorrow lean her drooping head
and feed deep thought with many a dream
and lingering pause and lightly tread
fond wretch as if her step disturbd the dead


away we know that tears are vain
that death nor heeds nor hears distress
will this unteach us to complain
or make one mourner weep the less
and thou who tellst me to forget
thy looks are wan thine eyes are wet


though the day of my destinys over
and the star of my fate hath declined
thy soft heart refused to discover
the faults which so many could find
though thy soul with my grief was acquainted
it shrunk not to share it with me
and the love which my spirit hath painted
it never hath found but in thee


then when nature around me is smiling
the last smile which answers to mine
i do not believe it beguiling
because it reminds me of thine
and when winds are at war with the ocean
as the breasts i believed in with me
if their billows excite an emotion
it is that they bear me from thee


though the rock of my last hope is shivered
and its fragments are sunk in the wave
though i feel that my soul is delivered
to painit shall not be its slave
there is many a pang to pursue me
they may crush but they shall not contemn
they may torture but shall not subdue me
tis of thee that i thinknot of them


though human thou didst not deceive me
though woman thou didst not forsake
though loved thou forborest to grieve me
though slanderd thou never couldst shake
though trusted thou didst not disclaim me
though parted it was not to fly
though watchful twas not to defame me
nor mute that the world might belie


yet i blame not the world nor despise it
nor the war of the many with one
if my soul was not fitted to prize it
twas folly not sooner to shun
and if dearly that error hath cost me
and more than i once could foresee
i have found that whatever it lost me
it could not deprive me of thee


from the wreck of the past which hath perishd
thus much i at least may recall
it hath taught me that what i most cherishd
deserved to be dearest of all
in the desert a fountain is springing
in the wide waste there still is a tree
and a bird in the solitude singing
which speaks to my spirit of thee


maid of athens ere we part
give oh give me back my heart
or since that has left my breast
keep it now and take the rest
hear my vow before i go


by those tresses unconfined
wood by each gean wind
by those lids whose jetty fringe
kiss thy soft cheeks blooming tinge
by those wild eyes like the roe


by that lip i long to taste
by that zoneencircled waist
by all the tokenflowers that tell
what words can never speak so well
by loves alternate joy and woe


maid of athens i am gone
think of me sweet when alone
though i fly to istambol
athens holds my heart and soul
can i cease to love thee no


the castled crag of drachenfels
frowns oer the wide and winding rhine
whose breast of waters broadly swells
between the banks which bear the vine
and hills all rich with blossomd trees
and fields which promise corn and wine
and scatterd cities crowning these
whose far white walls along them shine
have strewd a scene which i should see
with double joy wert thou with me


and peasant girls with deep blue eyes
and hands which offer early flowers
walk smiling oer this paradise
above the frequent feudal towers
through green leaves lift their walls of gray
and many a rock which steeply lowers
and noble arch in proud decay
look oer this vale of vintagebowers
but one thing want these banks of rhine
thy gentle hand to clasp in mine


i send the lilies given to me
though long before thy hand they touch
i know that they must witherd be
but yet reject them not as such
for i have cherishd them as dear
because they yet may meet thine eye
and guide thy soul to mine even here
when thou beholdst them drooping nigh
and knowst them gatherd by the rhine
and offerd from my heart to thine


the river nobly foams and flows
the charm of this enchanted ground
and all its thousand turns disclose
some fresher beauty varying round
the haughtiest breast its wish might bound
through life to dwell delighted here
nor could on earth a spot be found
to nature and to me so dear
could thy dear eyes in following mine
still sweeten more these banks of rhine


fare thee well and if for ever
still for ever fare thee well
even though unforgiving never
gainst thee shall my heart rebel


would that breast were bared before thee
where thy head so oft hath lain
while that placid sleep came oer thee
which thou neer canst know again


would that breast by thee glanced over
every inmost thought could show
then thou wouldst at last discover
twas not well to spurn it so


though the world for this commend thee
though it smile upon the blow
even its praises must offend thee
founded on anothers woe


though my many faults defaced me
could no other arm be found
than the one which once embraced me
to inflict a cureless wound


yet oh yet thyself deceive not
love may sink by slow decay
but by sudden wrench believe not
hearts can thus be torn away


still thine own its life retaineth
still must mine though bleeding beat
and the undying thought which paineth
isthat we no more may meet


these are words of deeper sorrow
than the wail above the dead
both shall live but every morrow
wake us from a widowd bed


and when thou wouldst solace gather
when our childs first accents flow
wilt thou teach her to say father
though his care she must forego


when her little hands shall press thee
when her lip to thine is pressd
think of him whose prayer shall bless thee
think of him thy love had blessd


should her lineaments resemble
those thou never more mayst see
then thy heart will softly tremble
with a pulse yet true to me


all my faults perchance thou knowest
all my madness none can know
all my hopes whereer thou goest
wither yet with thee they go


every feeling hath been shaken
pride which not a world could bow
bows to theeby thee forsaken
even my soul forsakes me now


but tis doneall words are idle
words from me are vainer still
but the thoughts we cannot bridle
force their way without the will


fare thee well thus disunited
torn from every nearer tie
seard in heart and lone and blighted
more than this i scarce can die


eternal spirit of the chainless mind
brightest in dungeons liberty thou art
for there thy habitation is the heart
the heart which love of thee alone can bind


and when thy sons to fetters are consignd
to fetters and the damp vaults dayless gloom
their country conquers with their martyrdom
and freedoms fame finds wings on every wind


chillon thy prison is a holy place
and thy sad floor an altar for twas trod
until his very steps have left a trace
worn as if thy cold pavement were a sod
by bonnivard may none those marks efface
for they appeal from tyranny to god


warriors and chiefs should the shaft or the sword
pierce me in leading the host of the lord
heed not the corse though a kings in your path
bury your steel in the bosoms of gath


thou who art bearing my buckler and bow
should the soldiers of saul look away from the foe
stretch me that moment in blood at thy feet
mine be the doom which they dared not to meet


farewell to others but never we part
heir to my royalty son of my heart
bright is the diadem boundless the sway
or kingly the death which awaits us today


tis time this heart should be unmoved
since others it hath ceased to move
yet though i cannot be beloved
still let me love


my days are in the yellow leaf
the flowers and fruits of love are gone
the worm the canker and the grief
are mine alone


the fire that on my bosom preys
is lone as some volcanic isle
no torch is kindled at its blaze
a funeral pile


the hope the fear the jealous care
the exalted portion of the pain
and power of love i cannot share
but wear the chain


but tis not thusand tis not here
such thoughts should shake my soul nor now
where glory decks the heros bier
or binds his brow


the sword the banner and the field
glory and greece around me see
the spartan borne upon his shield
was not more free


awake not greeceshe is awake
awake my spirit think through whom
thy lifeblood tracks its parent lake
and then strike home


tread those reviving passions down
unworthy manhoodunto thee
indifferent should the smile or frown
of beauty be


if thou regretst thy youth why live
the land of honourable death
is hereup to the field and give
away thy breath


seek outless often sought than found
a soldiers grave for thee the best
then look around and choose thy ground
and take thy rest


and thou art dead as young and fair
as aught of mortal birth
and forms so soft and charms so rare
too soon returnd to earth
though earth received them in her bed
and oer the spot the crowd may tread
in carelessness or mirth
there is an eye which could not brook
a moment on that grave to look


i will not ask where thou liest low
nor gaze upon the spot
there flowers or weeds at will may grow
so i behold them not
it is enough for me to prove
that what i loved and long must love
like common earth can rot
to me there needs no stone to tell
tis nothing that i loved so well


yet did i love thee to the last
as fervently as thou
who didst not change through all the past
and canst not alter now
the love where death has set his seal
nor age can chill nor rival steal
nor falsehood disavow
and what were worse thou canst not see
or wrong or change or fault in me


the better days of life were ours
the worst can be but mine
the sun that cheers the storm that lours
shall never more be thine
the silence of that dreamless sleep
i envy now too much to weep
nor need i to repine
that all those charms have passd away
i might have watchd through long decay


the flower in ripend bloom unmatchd
must fall the earliest prey
though by no hand untimely snatchd
the leaves must drop away
and yet it were a greater grief
to watch it withering leaf by leaf
than see it pluckd today
since earthly eye but ill can bear
to trace the change to foul from fair


i know not if i could have borne
to see thy beauties fade
the night that followd such a morn
had worn a deeper shade
thy day without a cloud hath past
and thou wert lovely to the last
extinguishd not decayd
as stars that shoot along the sky
shine brightest as they fall from high


as once i wept if i could weep
my tears might well be shed
to think i was not near to keep
one vigil oer thy bed
to gaze how fondly on thy face
to fold thee in a faint embrace
uphold thy drooping head
and show that love however vain
nor thou nor i can feel again


yet how much less it were to gain
though thou hast left me free
the loveliest things that still remain
than thus remember thee
the all of thine that cannot die
through dark and dread eternity
returns again to me
and more thy buried love endears
than aught except its living years


theres not a joy the world can give like that it takes away
when the glow of early thought declines in feelings dull decay
tis not on youths smooth cheek the blush alone which fades so fast
but the tender bloom of heart is gone ere youth itself be past


then the few whose spirits float above the wreck of happiness
are driven oer the shoals of guilt or ocean of excess
the magnet of their course is gone or only points in vain
the shore to which their shiverd sail shall never stretch again


then the mortal coldness of the soul like death itself comes down
it cannot feel for others woes it dare not dream its own
that heavy chill has frozen oer the fountain of our tears
and though the eye may sparkle still tis where the ice appears


though wit may flash from fluent lips and mirth distract the breast
through midnight hours that yield no more their former hope of rest
tis but as ivyleaves around the ruind turret wreathe
all green and wildly fresh without but worn and gray beneath


o could i feel as i have felt or be what i have been
or weep as i could once have wept oer many a vanishd scene
as springs in deserts found seem sweet all brackish though they be
so midst the witherd waste of life those tears would flow to me


of great limbs gone to chaos
a great face turned to night
why bend above a shapeless shroud
seeking in such archaic cloud
sight of strong lords and light


where seven sunken englands
lie buried one by one
why should one idle spade i wonder
shake up the dust of thanes like thunder
to smoke and choke the sun


in cloud of clay so cast to heaven
what shape shall man discern
these lords may light the mystery
of mastery or victory
and these ride high in history
but these shall not return


gored on the norman gonfalon
the golden dragon died
we shall not wake with ballad strings
the good time of the smaller things
we shall not see the holy kings
ride down by severn side


stiff strange and quaintly coloured
as the broidery of bayeux
the england of that dawn remains
and this of alfred and the danes
seems like the tales a whole tribe feigns
too english to be true


of a good king on an island
that ruled once on a time
and as he walked by an apple tree
there came green devils out of the sea
with seaplants trailing heavily
and tracks of opal slime


yet alfred is no fairy tale
his days as our days ran
he also looked forth for an hour
on peopled plains and skies that lower
from those few windows in the tower
that is the head of a man


but who shall look from alfreds hood
or breathe his breath alive
his century like a small dark cloud
drifts far it is an eyeless crowd
where the tortured trumpets scream aloud
and the dense arrows drive


lady by one light only
we look from alfreds eyes
we know he saw athwart the wreck
the sign that hangs about your neck
where one more than melchizedek
is dead and never dies


therefore i bring these rhymes to you
who brought the cross to me
since on you flaming without flaw
i saw the sign that guthrum saw
when he let break his ships of awe
and laid peace on the sea


do you remember when we went
under a dragon moon
and mid volcanic tints of night
walked where they fought the unknown fight
and saw black trees on the battleheight
black thorn on ethandune


and i thought i will go with you
as man with god has gone
and wander with a wandering star
the wandering heart of things that are
the fiery cross of love and war
that like yourself goes on


o go you onward where you are
shall honour and laughter be
past purpled forest and pearled foam
gods winged pavilion free to roam
your face that is a wandering home
a flying home for me


ride through the silent earthquake lands
wide as a waste is wide
across these days like deserts when
pride and a little scratching pen
have dried and split the hearts of men
heart of the heroes ride


up through an empty house of stars
being what heart you are
up the inhuman steeps of space
as on a staircase go in grace
carrying the firelight on your face
beyond the loneliest star


take these in memory of the hour
we strayed a space from home
and saw the smokehued hamlets quaint
with westland king and westland saint
and watched the western glory faint
along the road to frome


before the gods that made the gods
had seen their sunrise pass
the white horse of the white horse vale
was cut out of the grass


before the gods that made the gods
had drunk at dawn their fill
the white horse of the white horse vale
was hoary on the hill


age beyond age on british land
aeons on aeons gone
was peace and war in western hills
and the white horse looked on


for the white horse knew england
when there was none to know
he saw the first oar break or bend
he saw heaven fall and the world end
o god how long ago


for the end of the world was long ago
and all we dwell today
as children of some second birth
like a strange people left on earth
after a judgment day


for the end of the world was long ago
when the ends of the world waxed free
when rome was sunk in a waste of slaves
and the sun drowned in the sea


when caesars sun fell out of the sky
and whoso hearkened right
could only hear the plunging
of the nations in the night


when the ends of the earth came marching in
to torch and cresset gleam
and the roads of the world that lead to rome
were filled with faces that moved like foam
like faces in a dream


and men rode out of the eastern lands
broad river and burning plain
trees that are titan flowers to see
and tiger skies striped horribly
with tints of tropic rain


where inds enamelled peaks arise
around that inmost one
where ancient eagles on its brink
vast as archangels gather and drink
the sacrament of the sun


and men brake out of the northern lands
enormous lands alone
where a spell is laid upon life and lust
and the rain is changed to a silver dust
and the sea to a great green stone


and a shape that moveth murkily
in mirrors of ice and night
hath blanched with fear all beasts and birds
as death and a shock of evil words
blast a mans hair with white


and the cry of the palms and the purple moons
or the cry of the frost and foam
swept ever around an inmost place
and the din of distant race on race
cried and replied round rome


and there was death on the emperor
and night upon the pope
and alfred hiding in deep grass
hardened his heart with hope


a seafolk blinder than the sea
broke all about his land
but alfred up against them bare
and gripped the ground and grasped the air
staggered and strove to stand


he bent them back with spear and spade
with desperate dyke and wall
with foemen leaning on his shield
and roaring on him when he reeled
and no help came at all


he broke them with a broken sword
a little towards the sea
and for one hour of panting peace
ringed with a roar that would not cease
with golden crown and girded fleece
made laws under a tree


the northmen came about our land
a christless chivalry
who knew not of the arch or pen
great beautiful halfwitted men
from the sunrise and the sea


misshapen ships stood on the deep
full of strange gold and fire
and hairy men as huge as sin
with horned heads came wading in
through the long low seamire


our towns were shaken of tall kings
with scarlet beards like blood
the world turned empty where they trod
they took the kindly cross of god
and cut it up for wood


their souls were drifting as the sea
and all good towns and lands
they only saw with heavy eyes
and broke with heavy hands


their gods were sadder than the sea
gods of a wandering will
who cried for blood like beasts at night
sadly from hill to hill


they seemed as trees walking the earth
as witless and as tall
yet they took hold upon the heavens
and no help came at all


they bred like birds in english woods
they rooted like the rose
when alfred came to athelney
to hide him from their bows


there was not english armour left
nor any english thing
when alfred came to athelney
to be an english king


for earthquake swallowing earthquake
uprent the wessex tree
the whirlpool of the pagan sway
had swirled his sires as sticks away
when a flood smites the sea


and the great kings of wessex
wearied and sank in gore
and even their ghosts in that great stress
grew greyer and greyer less and less
with the lords that died in lyonesse
and the king that comes no more


and the god of the golden dragon
was dumb upon his throne
and the lord of the golden dragon
ran in the woods alone


and if ever he climbed the crest of luck
and set the flag before
returning as a wheel returns
came ruin and the rain that burns
and all began once more


and naught was left king alfred
but shameful tears of rage
in the island in the river
in the end of all his age


in the island in the river
he was broken to his knee
and he read writ with an iron pen
that god had wearied of wessex men
and given their country field and fen
to the devils of the sea


and he saw in a little picture
tiny and far away
his mother sitting in egberts hall
and a book she showed him very small
where a sapphire mary sat in stall
with a golden christ at play


it was wrought in the monks slow manner
from silver and sanguine shell
where the scenes are little and terrible
keyholes of heaven and hell


in the river island of athelney
with the river running past
in colours of such simple creed
all things sprang at him sun and weed
till the grass grew to be grass indeed
and the tree was a tree at last


fearfully plain the flowers grew
like the childs book to read
or like a friends face seen in a glass
he looked and there our lady was
she stood and stroked the tall live grass
as a man strokes his steed


her face was like an open word
when brave men speak and choose
the very colours of her coat
were better than good news


she spoke not nor turned not
nor any sign she cast
only she stood up straight and free
between the flowers in athelney
and the river running past


one dim ancestral jewel hung
on his ruined armour grey
he rent and cast it at her feet
where after centuries with slow feet
men came from hall and school and street
and found it where it lay


mother of god the wanderer said
i am but a common king
nor will i ask what saints may ask
to see a secret thing


the gates of heaven are fearful gates
worse than the gates of hell
not i would break the splendours barred
or seek to know the thing they guard
which is too good to tell


but for this earth most pitiful
this little land i know
if that which is for ever is
or if our hearts shall break with bliss
seeing the stranger go


when our last bow is broken queen
and our last javelin cast
under some sad green evening sky
holding a ruined cross on high
under warm westland grass to lie
shall we come home at last


and a voice came human but high up
like a cottage climbed among
the clouds or a serf of hut and croft
that sits by his hovel fire as oft
but hears on his old bare roof aloft
a belfry burst in song


the gates of heaven are lightly locked
we do not guard our gain
the heaviest hind may easily
come silently and suddenly
upon me in a lane


and any little maid that walks
in good thoughts apart
may break the guard of the three kings
and see the dear and dreadful things
i hid within my heart


the meanest man in grey fields gone
behind the set of sun
heareth between star and other star
through the door of the darkness fallen ajar
the council eldest of things that are
the talk of the three in one


the gates of heaven are lightly locked
we do not guard our gold
men may uproot where worlds begin
or read the name of the nameless sin
but if he fail or if he win
to no good man is told


the men of the east may spell the stars
and times and triumphs mark
but the men signed of the cross of christ
go gaily in the dark


the men of the east may search the scrolls
for sure fates and fame
but the men that drink the blood of god
go singing to their shame


the wise men know what wicked things
are written on the sky
they trim sad lamps they touch sad strings
hearing the heavy purple wings
where the forgotten seraph kings
still plot how god shall die


the wise men know all evil things
under the twisted trees
where the perverse in pleasure pine
and men are weary of green wine
and sick of crimson seas


but you and all the kind of christ
are ignorant and brave
and you have wars you hardly win
and souls you hardly save


i tell you naught for your comfort
yea naught for your desire
save that the sky grows darker yet
and the sea rises higher


night shall be thrice night over you
and heaven an iron cope
do you have joy without a cause
yea faith without a hope


even as she spoke she was not
nor any word said he
he only heard still as he stood
under the old nights nodding hood
the seafolk breaking down the wood
like a high tide from sea


he only heard the heathen men
whose eyes are blue and bleak
singing about some cruel thing
done by a great and smiling king
in daylight on a deck


he only heard the heathen men
whose eyes are blue and blind
singing what shameful things are done
between the sunlit sea and the sun
when the land is left behind


up across windy wastes and up
went alfred over the shaws
shaken of the joy of giants
the joy without a cause


in the slopes away to the western bays
where blows not ever a tree
he washed his soul in the west wind
and his body in the sea


and he set to rhyme his alemeasures
and he sang aloud his laws
because of the joy of the giants
the joy without a cause


the king went gathering wessex men
as grain out of the chaff
the few that were alive to die
laughing as littered skulls that lie
after lost battles turn to the sky
an everlasting laugh


the king went gathering christian men
as wheat out of the husk
eldred the franklin by the sea
and mark the man from italy
and colan of the sacred tree
from the old tribe on usk


the rook croaked homeward heavily
the west was clear and warm
the smoke of evening food and ease
rose like a blue tree in the trees
when he came to eldreds farm


but eldreds farm was fallen awry
like an old cripples bones
and eldreds tools were red with rust
and on his well was a green crust
and purple thistles upward thrust
between the kitchen stones


but smoke of some good feasting
went upwards evermore
and eldreds doors stood wide apart
for loitering foot or labouring cart
and eldreds great and foolish heart
stood open like his door


a mighty man was eldred
a bulk for casks to fill
his face a dreaming furnace
his body a walking hill


in the old wars of wessex
his sword had sunken deep
but all his friends he signed and said
were broken about ethelred
and between the deep drink and the dead
he had fallen upon sleep


come not to me king alfred save always for the ale
why should my harmless hinds be slain
because the chiefs cry once again
as in all fights that we shall gain
and in all fights we fail


your scalds still thunder and prophesy
that crown that never comes
friend i will watch the certain things
swine and slow moons like silver rings
and the ripening of the plums


and alfred answered drinking
and gravely without blame
nor bear i boast of scald or king
the thing i bear is a lesser thing
but comes in a better name


out of the mouth of the mother of god
more than the doors of doom
i call the muster of wessex men
from grassy hamlet or ditch or den
to break and be broken god knows when
but i have seen for whom


out of the mouth of the mother of god
like a little word come i
for i go gathering christian men
from sunken paving and ford and fen
to die in a battle god knows when
by god but i know why


and this is the word of mary
the word of the worlds desire
no more of comfort shall ye get
save that the sky grows darker yet
and the sea rises higher


then silence sank and slowly
arose the sealand lord
like some vast beast for mystery
he filled the room and porch and sky
and from a cobwebbed nail on high
unhooked his heavy sword


up on the shrill seadowns and up
went alfred all alone
turning but once eer the door was shut
shouting to eldred over his butt
that he bring all spears to the woodmans hut
hewn under egberts stone


and he turned his back and broke the fern
and fought the moths of dusk
and went on his way for other friends
friends fallen of all the wide worlds ends
from rome that wrath and pardon sends
and the grey tribes on usk


he saw gigantic tracks of death
and many a shape of doom
good steadings to grey ashes gone
and a monks house white like a skeleton
in the green crypt of the combe


and in many a roman villa
earth and her ivies eat
saw coloured pavements sink and fade
in flowers and the windy colonnade
like the spectre of a street


but the cold stars clustered
among the cold pines
ere he was half on his pilgrimage
over the western lines


and the white dawn widened
ere he came to the last pine
where mark the man from italy
still made the christian sign


the long farm lay on the large hillside
flat like a painted plan
and by the side the low white house
where dwelt the southland man


a bronzed man with a birds bright eye
and a strong birds beak and brow
his skin was brown like buried gold
and of certain of his sires was told
that they came in the shining ship of old
with caesar in the prow


his fruit trees stood like soldiers
drilled in a straight line
his strange stiff olives did not fail
and all the kings of the earth drank ale
but he drank wine


wide over wasted british plains
stood never an arch or dome
only the trees to toss and reel
the tribes to bicker the beasts to squeal
but the eyes in his head were strong like steel
and his soul remembered rome


then alfred of the lonely spear
lifted his lion head
and fronted with the italians eye
asking him of his whence and why
king alfred stood and said


i am that oftdefeated king
whose failure fills the land
who fled before the danes of old
who chaffered with the danes with gold
who now upon the wessex wold
hardly has feet to stand


but out of the mouth of the mother of god
i have seen the truth like fire
thisthat the sky grows darker yet
and the sea rises higher


long looked the roman on the land
the trees as golden crowns
blazed drenched with dawn and dewempearled
while faintlier coloured freshlier curled
the clouds from underneath the world
stood up over the downs


these vines be ropes that drag me hard
he said i go not far
where would you meet for you must hold
half wiltshire and the white horse wold
and the thames bank to owsenfold
if wessex goes to war


guthrum sits strong on either bank
and you must press his lines
inwards and eastward drive him down
i doubt if you shall take the crown
till you have taken london town
for me i have the vines


if each man on the judgment day
meet god on a plain alone
said alfred i will speak for you
as for myself and call it true
that you brought all fighting folk you knew
lined under egberts stone


though i be in the dust ere then
i know where you will be
and shouldering suddenly his spear
he faded like some elfin fear
where the tall pines ran up tier on tier
tree overtoppling tree


he shouldered his spear at morning
and laughed to lay it on
but he leaned on his spear as on a staff
with might and little mood to laugh
or ever he sighted chick or calf
of colan of caerleon


for the man dwelt in a lost land
of boulders and broken men
in a great grey cave far off to the south
where a thick green forest stopped the mouth
giving darkness in his den


and the man was come like a shadow
from the shadow of druid trees
where usk with mighty murmurings
past caerleon of the fallen kings
goes out to ghostly seas


last of a race in ruin
he spoke the speech of the gaels
his kin were in holy ireland
or up in the crags of wales


but his soul stood with his mothers folk
that were of the rainwrapped isle
where patrick and brandan westerly
looked out at last on a landless sea
and the suns last smile


his harp was carved and cunning
as the celtic craftsman makes
graven all over with twisting shapes
like many headless snakes


his harp was carved and cunning
his sword prompt and sharp
and he was gay when he held the sword
sad when he held the harp


for the great gaels of ireland
are the men that god made mad
for all their wars are merry
and all their songs are sad


he kept the roman order
he made the christian sign
but his eyes grew often blind and bright
and the sea that rose in the rocks at night
rose to his head like wine


he made the sign of the cross of god
he knew the roman prayer
but he had unreason in his heart
because of the gods that were


even they that walked on the high cliffs
high as the clouds were then
gods of unbearable beauty
that broke the hearts of men


and whether in seat or saddle
whether with frown or smile
whether at feast or fight was he
he heard the noise of a nameless sea
on an undiscovered isle


lifting the great green ivy
and the great spear lowering
one said i am alfred of wessex
and i am a conquered king


and the man of the cave made answer
and his eyes were stars of scorn
and better kings were conquered
or ever your sires were born


what goddess was your mother
what fay your breed begot
that you should not die with uther
and arthur and lancelot


but when you win you brag and blow
and when you lose you rail
army of eastland yokels
not strong enough to fail


i bring not boast or railing
spake alfred not in ire
i bring of our lady a lesson set
thisthat the sky grows darker yet
and the sea rises higher


then colan of the sacred tree
tossed his black mane on high
and cried as rigidly he rose
and if the sea and sky be foes
we will tame the sea and sky


smiled alfred seek ye a fable
more dizzy and more dread
than all your mad barbarian tales
where the sky stands on its head


a tale where a man looks down on the sky
that has long looked down on him
a tale where a man can swallow a sea
that might swallow the seraphim


bring to the hut by egberts stone
all bills and bows ye have
and alfred strode off rapidly
and colan of the sacred tree
went slowly to his cave


in a tree that yawned and twisted
the kings few goods were flung
a massbook mildewed line by line
and weapons and a skin of wine
and an old harp unstrung


by the yawning tree in the twilight
the king unbound his sword
severed the harp of all his goods
and there in the cool and soundless woods
sounded a single chord


then laughed and watched the finches flash
the sullen flies in swarm
and went unarmed over the hills
with the harp upon his arm


until he came to the white horse vale
and saw across the plains
in the twilight high and far and fell
like the fiery terraces of hell
the camp fires of the danes


the fires of the great army
that was made of iron men
whose lights of sacrilege and scorn
ran around england red as morn
fires over glastonbury thorn
fires out on ely fen


and as he went by white horse vale
he saw lie wan and wide
the old horse graven god knows when
by gods or beasts or what things then
walked a new world instead of men
and scrawled on the hillside


and when he came to white horse down
the great white horse was grey
for it was ill scoured of the weed
and lichen and thorn could crawl and feed
since the foes of settled house and creed
had swept old works away


king alfred gazed all sorrowful
at thistle and mosses grey
then laughed and watched the finches flash
till a rally of danes with shield and bill
rolled drunk over the dome of the hill
and hearing of his harp and skill
they dragged him to their play


and as they went through the high green grass
they roared like the great green sea
but when they came to the red camp fire
they were silent suddenly


and as they went up the wastes away
they went reeling to and fro
but when they came to the red camp fire
they stood all in a row


for golden in the firelight
with a smile carved on his lips
and a beard curled right cunningly
was guthrum of the northern sea
the emperor of the ships


with three great earls king guthrum
went the rounds from fire to fire
with harold nephew of the king
and ogier of the stone and sling
and elf whose gold lute had a string
that sighed like all desire


the earls of the great army
that no men born could tire
whose flames anear him or aloof
took hold of towers or walls of proof
fire over glastonbury roof
and out on ely fire


and guthrum heard the soldiers tale
and bade the stranger play
not harshly but as one on high
on a marble pillar in the sky
who sees all folk that live and die
pigmy and far away


and alfred king of wessex
looked on his conqueror
and his hands hardened but he played
and leaving all later hates unsaid
he sang of some old british raid
on the wild west march of yore


he sang of war in the warm wet shires
where rain nor fruitage fails
where england of the motley states
deepens like a garden to the gates
in the purple walls of wales


he sang of the seas of savage heads
and the seas and seas of spears
boiling all over offas dyke
what time a wessex club could strike
the kings of the mountaineers


till harold laughed and snatched the harp
the kinsman of the king
a big youth beardless like a child
whom the new wine of war sent wild
smote and began to sing


and he cried of the ships as eagles
that circle fiercely and fly
and sweep the seas and strike the towns
from cyprus round to skye


how swiftly and with peril
they gather all good things
the high horns of the forest beasts
or the secret stones of kings


for rome was given to rule the world
and gat of it little joy
but we but we shall enjoy the world
the whole huge world a toy


great wine like blood from burgundy
cloaks like the clouds from tyre
and marble like solid moonlight
and gold like frozen fire


smells that a man might swill in a cup
stones that a man might eat
and the great smooth women like ivory
that the turks sell in the street


he sang the song of the thief of the world
and the gods that love the thief
and he yelled aloud at the cloisteryards
where men go gathering grief


well have you sung o stranger
of death on the dyke in wales
your chief was a braceletgiver
but the red unbroken river
of a race runs not for ever
but suddenly it fails


doubtless your sires were swordswingers
when they waded fresh from foam
before they were turned to women
by the god of the nails from rome


but since you bent to the shaven men
who neither lust nor smite
thunder of thor we hunt you
a hare on the mountain height


king guthrum smiled a little
and said it is enough
nephew let elf retune the string
a boy must needs like bellowing
but the old ears of a careful king
are glad of songs less rough


blueeyed was elf the minstrel
with womanish hair and ring
yet heavy was his hand on sword
though light upon the string


and as he stirred the strings of the harp
to notes but four or five
the heart of each man moved in him
like a babe buried alive


and they felt the land of the folksongs
spread southward of the dane
and they heard the good rhine flowing
in the heart of all allemagne


they felt the land of the folksongs
where the gifts hang on the tree
where the girls give ale at morning
and the tears come easily


the mighty people womanlike
that have pleasure in their pain
as he sang of balder beautiful
whom the heavens loved in vain


as he sang of balder beautiful
whom the heavens could not save
till the world was like a sea of tears
and every soul a wave


there is always a thing forgotten
when all the world goes well
a thing forgotten as long ago
when the gods forgot the mistletoe
and soundless as an arrow of snow
the arrow of anguish fell


the thing on the blind side of the heart
on the wrong side of the door
the green plant groweth menacing
almighty lovers in the spring
there is always a forgotten thing
and love is not secure


and all that sat by the fire were sad
save ogier who was stern
and his eyes hardened even to stones
as he took the harp in turn


earl ogier of the stone and sling
was odd to ear and sight
old he was but his locks were red
and jests were all the words he said
yet he was sad at board and bed
and savage in the fight


you sing of the young gods easily
in the days when you are young
but i go smelling yew and sods
and i know there are gods behind the gods
gods that are best unsung


and a man grows ugly for women
and a man grows dull with ale
well if he find in his soul at last
fury that does not fail


the wrath of the gods behind the gods
who would rend all gods and men
well if the old mans heart hath still
wheels sped of rage and roaring will
like cataracts to break down and kill
well for the old man then


while there is one tall shrine to shake
or one live man to rend
for the wrath of the gods behind the gods
who are weary to make an end


there lives one moment for a man
when the door at his shoulder shakes
when the taut rope parts under the pull
and the barest branch is beautiful
one moment while it breaks


so rides my soul upon the sea
that drinks the howling ships
though in black jest it bows and nods
under the moons with silver rods
i know it is roaring at the gods
waiting the last eclipse


and in the last eclipse the sea
shall stand up like a tower
above all moons made dark and riven
hold up its foaming head in heaven
and laugh knowing its hour


and the high ones in the happy town
propped of the planets seven
shall know a new light in the mind
a noise about them and behind
shall hear an awful voice and find
foam in the courts of heaven


and you that sit by the fire are young
and true love waits for you
but the king and i grow old grow old
and hate alone is true


and guthrum shook his head but smiled
for he was a mighty clerk
and had read lines in the latin books
when all the north was dark


he said i am older than you ogier
not all things would i rend
for whether life be bad or good
it is best to abide the end


he took the great harp wearily
even guthrum of the danes
with wide eyes bright as the one long day
on the long polar plains


for he sang of a wheel returning
and the mire trod back to mire
and how red hells and golden heavens
are castles in the fire


it is good to sit where the good tales go
to sit as our fathers sat
but the hour shall come after his youth
when a man shall know not tales but truth
and his heart fail thereat


when he shall read what is written
so plain in clouds and clods
when he shall hunger without hope
even for evil gods


for this is a heavy matter
and the truth is cold to tell
do we not know have we not heard
the soul is like a lost bird
the body a broken shell


and a man hopes being ignorant
till in white woods apart
he finds at last the lost bird dead
and a man may still lift up his head
but never more his heart


there comes no noise but weeping
out of the ancient sky
and a tear is in the tiniest flower
because the gods must die


the little brooks are very sweet
like a girls ribbons curled
but the great sea is bitter
that washes all the world


strong are the roman roses
or the free flowers of the heath
but every flower like a flower of the sea
smelleth with the salt of death


and the heart of the locked battle
is the happiest place for men
when shrieking souls as shafts go by
and many have died and all may die
though this word be a mystery
death is most distant then


death blazes bright above the cup
and clear above the crown
but in that dream of battle
we seem to tread it down


wherefore i am a great king
and waste the world in vain
because man hath not other power
save that in dealing death for dower
he may forget it for an hour
to remember it again


and slowly his hands and thoughtfully
fell from the lifted lyre
and the owls moaned from the mighty trees
till alfred caught it to his knees
and smote it as in ire


he heaved the head of the harp on high
and swept the framework barred
and his stroke had all the rattle and spark
of horses flying hard


when god put man in a garden
he girt him with a sword
and sent him forth a free knight
that might betray his lord


he brake him and betrayed him
and fast and far he fell
till you and i may stretch our necks
and burn our beards in hell


but though i lie on the floor of the world
with the seven sins for rods
i would rather fall with adam
than rise with all your gods


what have the strong gods given
where have the glad gods led
when guthrum sits on a heros throne
and asks if he is dead


sirs i am but a nameless man
a rhymester without home
yet since i come of the wessex clay
and carry the cross of rome


i will even answer the mighty earl
that asked of wessex men
why they be meek and monkish folk
and bow to the white lords broken yoke
what sign have we save blood and smoke
here is my answer then


that on you is fallen the shadow
and not upon the name
that though we scatter and though we fly
and you hang over us like the sky
you are more tired of victory
than we are tired of shame


that though you hunt the christian man
like a hare on the hillside
the hare has still more heart to run
than you have heart to ride


that though all lances split on you
all swords be heaved in vain
we have more lust again to lose
than you to win again


your lord sits high in the saddle
a brokenhearted king
but our king alfred lost from fame
fallen among foes or bonds of shame
in i know not what mean trade or name
has still some song to sing


our monks go robed in rain and snow
but the heart of flame therein
but you go clothed in feasts and flames
when all is ice within


nor shall all iron dooms make dumb
men wondering ceaselessly
if it be not better to fast for joy
than feast for misery


nor monkish order only
slides down as field to fen
all things achieved and chosen pass
as the white horse fades in the grass
no work of christian men


ere the sad gods that made your gods
saw their sad sunrise pass
the white horse of the white horse vale
that you have left to darken and fail
was cut out of the grass


therefore your end is on you
is on you and your kings
not for a fire in ely fen
not that your gods are nine or ten
but because it is only christian men
guard even heathen things


for our god hath blessed creation
calling it good i know
what spirit with whom you blindly band
hath blessed destruction with his hand
yet by gods death the stars shall stand
and the small apples grow


and the king with harp on shoulder
stood up and ceased his song
and the owls moaned from the mighty trees
and the danes laughed loud and long


thick thunder of the snorting swine
enormous in the gloam
rending among all roots that cling
and the wild horses whinnying
were the nights noises when the king
shouldering his harp went home


with eyes of owl and feet of fox
full of all thoughts he went
he marked the tilt of the pagan camp
the paling of pine the sentries tramp
and the one great stolen altarlamp
over guthrum in his tent


by scrub and thorn in ethandune
that night the foe had lain
whence ran across the heather grey
the old stones of a roman way
and in a wood not far away
the pale road split in twain


he marked the wood and the cloven ways
with an old captains eyes
and he thought how many a time had he
sought to see doom he could not see
how ruin had come and victory
and both were a surprise


even so he had watched and wondered
under ashdown from the plains
with ethelred praying in his tent
till the white hawthorn swung and bent
as alfred rushed his spears and rent
the shieldwall of the danes


even so he had watched and wondered
knowing neither less nor more
till all his lords lay dying
and axes on axes plying
flung him and drove him flying
like a pirate to the shore


wise he had been before defeat
and wise before success
wise in both hours and ignorant
knowing neither more nor less


as he went down to the riverhut
he knew a nightshade scent
owls did as evil cherubs rise
with little wings and lantern eyes
as though he sank through the underskies
but down and down he went


as he went down to the riverhut
he went as one that fell
seeing the high forest domes and spars
dim green or torn with golden scars
as the proud look up at the evil stars
in the red heavens of hell


for he must meet by the riverhut
them he had bidden to arm
mark from the towers of italy
and colan of the sacred tree
and eldred who beside the sea
held heavily his farm


the roof leaned gaping to the grass
as a monstrous mushroom lies
echoing and empty seemed the place
but opened in a little space
a great grey woman with scarred face
and strong and humbled eyes


king alfred was but a meagre man
bright eyed but lean and pale
and swordless with his harp and rags
he seemed a beggar such as lags
looking for crusts and ale


and the woman with a womans eyes
of pity at once and ire
said when that she had glared a span
there is a cake for any man
if he will watch the fire


and alfred bowing heavily
sat down the fire to stir
and even as the woman pitied him
so did he pity her


saying o great heart in the night
o best cast forth for worst
twilight shall melt and morning stir
and no kind thing shall come to her
till god shall turn the world over
and all the last are first


and well may god with the servingfolk
cast in his dreadful lot
is not he too a servant
and is not he forgot


for was not god my gardener
and silent like a slave
that opened oaks on the uplands
or thicket in graveyard gave


and was not god my armourer
all patient and unpaid
that sealed my skull as a helmet
and ribs for hauberk made


did not a great grey servant
of all my sires and me
build this pavilion of the pines
and herd the fowls and fill the vines
and labour and pass and leave no signs
save mercy and mystery


for god is a great servant
and rose before the day
from some primordial slumber torn
but all we living later born
sleep on and rise after the morn
and the lord has gone away


on things half sprung from sleeping
all sleepy suns have shone
they stretch stiff arms the yawning trees
the beasts blink upon hands and knees
man is awake and does and sees
but heaven has done and gone


for who shall guess the good riddle
or speak of the holiest
save in faint figures and failing words
who loves yet laughs among the swords
labours and is at rest


but some see god like guthrum
crowned with a great beard curled
but i see god like a good giant
that labouring lifts the world


wherefore was god in golgotha
slain as a serf is slain
and hate he had of prince and peer
and love he had and made good cheer
of them that like this woman here
go powerfully in pain


but in this grey morn of mans life
cometh sometime to the mind
a little light that leaps and flies
like a star blown on the wind


a star of nowhere a nameless star
a light that spins and swirls
and cries that even in hedge and hill
even on earth it may go ill
at last with the evil earls


a dancing sparkle a doubtful star
on the waste wind whirled and driven
but it seems to sing of a wilder worth
a time discrowned of doom and birth
and the kingdom of the poor on earth
come as it is in heaven


but even though such days endure
how shall it profit her
who shall go groaning to the grave
with many a meek and mighty slave
fieldbreaker and fisher on the wave
and woodman and waggoner


bake ye the big world all again
a cake with kinder leaven
yet these are sorry evermore
unless there be a little door
a little door in heaven


and as he wept for the woman
he let her business be
and like his royal oath and rash
the good food fell upon the ash
and blackened instantly


screaming the woman caught a cake
yet burning from the bar
and struck him suddenly on the face
leaving a scarlet scar


king alfred stood up wordless
a man dead with surprise
and torture stood and the evil things
that are in the childish hearts of kings
an instant in his eyes


and even as he stood and stared
drew round him in the dusk
those friends creeping from faroff farms
marcus with all his slaves in arms
and the strange spears hung with ancient charms
of colan of the usk


with one whole farm marching afoot
the trampled road resounds
farmhands and farmbeasts blundering by
and jars of mead and stores of rye
where eldred strode above his high
and thunderthroated hounds


and grey cattle and silver lowed
against the unlifted morn
and straw clung to the spearshafts tall
and a boy went before them all
blowing a rams horn


as mocking such rude revelry
the dim clan of the gael
came like a bad kings burialend
with dismal robes that drop and rend
and demon pipes that wail


in long outlandish garments
torn though of antique worth
with druid beards and druid spears
as a resurrected race appears
out of an elder earth


and though the king had called them forth
and knew them for his own
so still each eye stood like a gem
so spectral hung each broidered hem
grey carven men he fancied them
hewn in an age of stone


and the two wild peoples of the north
stood fronting in the gloam
and heard and knew each in its mind
the third great thunder on the wind
the living walls that hedge mankind
the walking walls of rome


marks were the mixed tribes of the west
of many a hue and strain
gurth with rank hair like yellow grass
and the cornish fisher gorlias
and halmer come from his first mass
lately baptized a dane


but like one man in armour
those hundreds trod the field
from red arabia to the tyne
the earth had heard that marchingline
since the cry on the hill capitoline
and the fall of the golden shield


and the earth shook and the king stood still
under the greenwood bough
and the smoking cake lay at his feet
and the blow was on his brow


then alfred laughed out suddenly
like thunder in the spring
till shook aloud the lintelbeams
and the squirrels stirred in dusty dreams
and the startled birds went up in streams
for the laughter of the king


and the beasts of the earth and the birds looked down
in a wild solemnity
on a stranger sight than a sylph or elf
on one man laughing at himself
under the greenwood tree


the giant laughter of christian men
that roars through a thousand tales
where greed is an ape and pride is an ass
and jacks away with his masters lass
and the miser is banged with all his brass
the farmer with all his flails


tales that tumble and tales that trick
yet end not all in scorning
of kings and clowns in a merry plight
and the clock gone wrong and the world gone right
that the mummers sing upon christmas night
and christmas day in the morning


now here is a good warrant
cried alfred by my sword
for he that is struck for an ill servant
should be a kind lord


he that has been a servant
knows more than priests and kings
but he that has been an ill servant
he knows all earthly things


pride flings frail palaces at the sky
as a man flings up sand
but the firm feet of humility
take hold of heavy land


pride juggles with her toppling towers
they strike the sun and cease
but the firm feet of humility
they grip the ground like trees


he that hath failed in a little thing
hath a sign upon the brow
and the earls of the great army
have no such seal to show


the red print on my forehead
small flame for a red star
in the van of the violent marching then
when the sky is torn of the trumpets ten
and the hands of the happy howling men
fling wide the gates of war


this blow that i return not
ten times will i return
on kings and earls of all degree
and armies wide as empires be
shall slide like landslips to the sea
if the red star burn


one man shall drive a hundred
as the dead kings drave
before me rocking hosts be riven
and battering cohorts backwards driven
for i am the first king known of heaven
that has been struck like a slave


up on the old white road brothers
up on the roman walls
for this is the night of the drawing of swords
and the tainted tower of the heathen hordes
leans to our hammers fires and cords
leans a little and falls


follow the star that lives and leaps
follow the sword that sings
for we go gathering heathen men
a terrible harvest ten by ten
as the wrath of the last red autumnthen
when christ reaps down the kings


follow a light that leaps and spins
follow the fire unfurled
for riseth up against realm and rod
a thing forgotten a thing downtrod
the last lost giant even god
is risen against the world


roaring they went oer the roman wall
and roaring up the lane
their torches tossed a ladder of fire
higher their hymn was heard and higher
more sweet for hate and for hearts desire
and up in the northern scrub and brier
they fell upon the dane


king guthrum was a dread king
like death out of the north
shrines without name or number
he rent and rolled as lumber
from chester to the humber
he drove his foemen forth


the roman villas heard him
in the valley of the thames
come over the hills roaring
above their roofs and pouring
on spire and stair and flooring
brimstone and pitch and flames


sheer oer the great chalk uplands
and the hill of the horse went he
till high on hampshire beacons
he saw the southern sea


high on the heights of wessex
he saw the southern brine
and turned him to a conquered land
and where the northern thornwoods stand
and the road parts on either hand
there came to him a sign


king guthrum was a warchief
a wise man in the field
and though he prospered well and knew
how alfreds folk were sad and few
not less with weighty care he drew
long lines for pike and shield


king guthrum lay on the upper land
on a single road at gaze
and his foe must come with lean array
up the left arm of the cloven way
to the meeting of the ways


and long ere the noise of armour
an hour ere the break of light
the woods awoke with crash and cry
and the birds sprang clamouring harsh and high
and the rabbits ran like an elves army
ere alfred came in sight


the live wood came at guthrum
on foot and claw and wing
the nests were noisy overhead
for alfred and the star of red
all life went forth and the forest fled
before the face of the king


but halted in the woodways
christs few were grim and grey
and each with a small far birdlike sight
saw the high folly of the fight
and though strange joys had grown in the night
despair grew with the day


and when white dawn crawled through the wood
like cold foam of a flood
then weakened every warriors mood
in hope though not in hardihood
and each man sorrowed as he stood
in the fashion of his blood


for the saxon franklin sorrowed
for the things that had been fair
for the dear dead woman crimsonclad
and the great feasts and the friends he had
but the celtic princes soul was sad
for the things that never were


in the eyes italian all things
but a black laughter died
and alfred flung his shield to earth
and smote his breast and cried


i wronged a man to his slaying
and a woman to her shame
and once i looked on a sworn maid
that was wed to the holy name


and once i took my neighbours wife
that was bound to an eastland man
in the starkness of my evil youth
before my griefs began


people if you have any prayers
say prayers for me
and lay me under a christian stone
in that lost land i thought my own
to wait till the holy horn is blown
and all poor men are free


then eldred of the idle farm
leaned on his ancient sword
as fell his heavy words and few
and his eyes were of such alien blue
as gleams where the northman saileth new
into an unknown fiord


i was a fool and wasted ale
my slaves found it sweet
i was a fool and wasted bread
and the birds had bread to eat


the kings go up and the kings go down
and who knows who shall rule
next night a king may starve or sleep
but men and birds and beasts shall weep
at the burial of a fool


o drunkards in my cellar
boys in my apple tree
the world grows stern and strange and new
and wise men shall govern you
and you shall weep for me


but yoke me my own oxen
down to my own farm
my own dog will whine for me
my own friends will bend the knee
and the foes i slew openly
have never wished me harm


and all were moved a little
but colan stood apart
having first pity and after
hearing like rat in rafter
that little worm of laughter
that eats the irish heart


and his greygreen eyes were cruel
and the smile of his mouth waxed hard
and he said and when did britain
become your buryingyard


before the romans lit the land
when schools and monks were none
we reared such stones to the sungod
as might put out the sun


the tall trees of britain
we worshipped and were wise
but you shall raid the whole land through
and never a tree shall talk to you
though every leaf is a tongue taught true
and the forest is full of eyes


on one round hill to the seaward
the trees grow tall and grey
and the trees talk together
when all men are away


oer a few round hills forgotten
the trees grow tall in rings
and the trees talk together
of many pagan things


yet i could lie and listen
with a cross upon my clay
and hear unhurt for ever
what the trees of britain say


a proud man was the roman
his speech a single one
but his eyes were like an eagles eyes
that is staring at the sun


dig for me where i die he said
if first or last i fall
dead on the fell at the first charge
or dead by wantage wall


lift not my head from bloody ground
bear not my body home
for all the earth is roman earth
and i shall die in rome


then alfred king of england
bade blow the horns of war
and fling the golden dragon out
with crackle and acclaim and shout
scrolled and aflame and far


and under the golden dragon
went wessex all along
past the sharp point of the cloven ways
out from the black wood into the blaze
of sun and steel and song


and when they came to the open land
they wheeled deployed and stood
midmost were marcus and the king
and eldred on the righthand wing
and leftwards colan darkling
in the last shade of the wood


but the earls of the great army
lay like a long half moon
ten poles before their palisades
with widewinged helms and runic blades
red giants of an age of raids
in the thornland of ethandune


midmost the saddles rose and swayed
and a stir of horses manes
where guthrum and a few rode high
on horses seized in victory
but ogier went on foot to die
in the old way of the danes


far to the kings left elf the bard
led on the eastern wing
with songs and spells that change the blood
and on the kings right harold stood
the kinsman of the king


young harold coarse with colours gay
smoking with oil and musk
and the pleasant violence of the young
pushed through his people giving tongue
foewards where grey as cobwebs hung
the banners of the usk


but as he came before his line
a little space along
his beardless face broke into mirth
and he cried what broken bits of earth
are here for what their clothes are worth
i would sell them for a song


for colan was hung with raiment
tattered like autumn leaves
and his men were all as thin as saints
and all as poor as thieves


no bows nor slings nor bolts they bore
but bills and pikes illmade
and none but colan bore a sword
and rusty was its blade


and colans eyes with mystery
and iron laughter stirred
and he spoke aloud but lightly
not labouring to be heard


oh truly we be broken hearts
for that cause it is said
we light our candles to that lord
that broke himself for bread


but though we hold but bitterly
what land the saxon leaves
though ireland be but a land of saints
and wales a land of thieves


i say you yet shall weary
of the working of your word
that stricken spirits never strike
nor lean hands hold a sword


and if ever ye ride in ireland
the jest may yet be said
there is the land of broken hearts
and the land of broken heads


not less barbarian laughter
choked harold like a flood
and shall i fight with scarecrows
that am of guthrums blood


meeting may be of warmen
where the best warman wins
but all this carrion a man shoots
before the fight begins


and stopping in his onward strides
he snatched a bow in scorn
from some mean slave and bent it on
colan whose doom grew dark and shone
stars evil over caerleon
in the place where he was born


for colan had not bow nor sling
on a lonely sword leaned he
like arthur on excalibur
in the battle by the sea


to his great gold earring harold
tugged back the feathered tail
and swift had sprung the arrow
but swifter sprang the gael


whirling the one sword round his head
a great wheel in the sun
he sent it splendid through the sky
flying before the shaft could fly
it smote earl harold over the eye
and blood began to run


colan stood bare and weaponless
earl harold as in pain
strove for a smile put hand to head
stumbled and suddenly fell dead
and the small white daisies all waxed red
with blood out of his brain


and all at that marvel of the sword
cast like a stone to slay
cried out said alfred who would see
signs must give all things verily
man shall not taste of victory
till he throws his sword away


then alfred prince of england
and all the christian earls
unhooked their swords and held them up
each offered to colan like a cup
of chrysolite and pearls


and the king said do thou take my sword
who have done this deed of fire
for this is the manner of christian men
whether of steel or priestly pen
that they cast their hearts out of their ken
to get their hearts desire


and whether ye swear a hive of monks
or one fair wife to friend
this is the manner of christian men
that their oath endures the end


for love our lord at the end of the world
sits a red horse like a throne
with a brazen helm and an iron bow
but one arrow alone


love with the shield of the broken heart
ever his bow doth bend
with a single shaft for a single prize
and the ultimate bolt that parts and flies
comes with a thunder of split skies
and a sound of souls that rend


so shall you earn a kings sword
who cast your sword away
and the king took with a random eye
a rude axe from a hind hard by
and turned him to the fray


for the swords of the earls of daneland
flamed round the fallen lord
the first blood woke the trumpettune
as in monks rhyme or wizards rune
beginneth the battle of ethandune
with the throwing of the sword


as the sea flooding the flat sands
flew on the seaborn horde
the two hosts shocked with dust and din
left of the latian paladin
clanged all prince harolds howling kin
on colan and the sword


crashed in the midst on marcus
ogier with guthrum by
and eastward of such central stir
far to the right and faintlier
the house of elf the harpplayer
struck eldreds with a cry


the centre swat for weariness
stemming the screaming horde
and wearily went colans hands
that swung king alfreds sword


but like a cloud of morning
to eastward easily
tall eldred broke the sea of spears
as a tall ship breaks the sea


his face like a sanguine sunset
his shoulder a wessex down
his hand like a windy hammerstroke
men could not count the crests he broke
so fast the crests went down


as the tall white devil of the plague
moves out of asian skies
with his foot on a waste of cities
and his head in a cloud of flies


or purple and peacock skies grow dark
with a moving locusttower
or tawny sandwinds tall and dry
like hells red banners beat and fly
when death comes out of araby
was eldred in his hour


but while he moved like a massacre
he murmured as in sleep
and his words were all of low hedges
and little fields and sheep


even as he strode like a pestilence
that strides from rhine to rome
he thought how tall his beans might be
if ever he went home


spoke some stiff piece of childish prayer
dull as the distant chimes
that thanked our god for good eating
and corn and quiet times


till on the helm of a high chief
fell shatteringly his brand
and the helm broke and the bone broke
and the sword broke in his hand


then from the yelling northmen
driven splintering on him ran
full seven spears and the seventh
was never made by man


seven spears and the seventh
was wrought as the faerie blades
and given to elf the minstrel
by the monstrous watermaids


by them that dwell where luridly
lost waters of the rhine
move among roots of nations
being sunken for a sign


under all graves they murmur
they murmur and rebel
down to the buried kingdoms creep
and like a lost rain roar and weep
oer the red heavens of hell


thrice drowned was elf the minstrel
and washed as dead on sand
and the third time men found him
the spear was in his hand


seven spears went about eldred
like stays about a mast
but there was sorrow by the sea
for the driving of the last


six spears thrust upon eldred
were splintered while he laughed
one spear thrust into eldred
three feet of blade and shaft


and from the great heart grievously
came forth the shaft and blade
and he stood with the face of a dead man
stood a little and swayed


then fell as falls a battletower
on smashed and struggling spears
cast down from some unconquered town
that rushing earthward carries down
loads of live men of all renown
archers and engineers


and a great clamour of christian men
went up in agony
crying fallen is the tower of wessex
that stood beside the sea


centre and right the wessex guard
grew pale for doubt and fear
and the flank failed at the advance
for the deathlight on the wizard lance
the star of the evil spear


stand like an oak cried marcus
stand like a roman wall
eldred the good is fallen
are you too good to fall


when we were wan and bloodless
he gave you ale enow
the pirates deal with him as dung
god are you bloodless now


grip wulf and gorlias grip the ash
slaves and i make you free
stamp hildred hard in english land
stand gurth stand gorlias gawen stand
hold halfgar with the other hand
halmer hold up on knee


the lamps are dying in your homes
the fruits upon your bough
even now your old thatch smoulders gurth
now is the judgment of the earth
now is the deathgrip now


for thunder of the captain
not less the wessex line
leaned back and reeled a space to rear
as elf charged with the rhine maids spear
and roaring like the rhine


for the men were borne by the waving walls
of woods and clouds that pass
by dizzy plains and drifting sea
and they mixed god with glamoury
god with the gods of the burning tree
and the wizards tower and glass


but mark was come of the glittering towns
where hot white details show
where men can number and expound
and his faith grew in a hard ground
of doubt and reason and falsehood found
where no faith else could grow


belief that grew of all beliefs
one moment back was blown
and belief that stood on unbelief
stood up iron and alone


the wessex crescent backwards
crushed as with bloody spear
went elf roaring and routing
and mark against elf yet shouting
shocked in his midcareer


right on the roman shield and sword
did spear of the rhine maids run
but the shield shifted never
the sword rang down to sever
the great rhine sang for ever
and the songs of elf were done


and a great thunder of christian men
went up against the sky
saying god hath broken the evil spear
ere the good mans blood was dry


spears at the charge yelled mark amain
death on the gods of death
over the thrones of doom and blood
goeth god that is a craftsman good
and gold and iron earth and wood
loveth and laboureth


the fruits leap up in all your farms
the lamps in each abode
god of all good things done on earth
all wheels or webs of any worth
the god that makes the roof gurth
the god that makes the road


the god that heweth kings in oak
writeth songs on vellum
god of gold and flaming glass
confregit potentias
acrcuum scutum gorlias
gladium et bellum


steel and lightning broke about him
battlebays and palm
all the seakings swayed among
woods of the wessex arms upflung
the trumpet of the roman tongue
the thunder of the psalm


and midmost of that rolling field
ran ogier ragingly
lashing at mark who turned his blow
and brake the helm about his brow
and broke him to his knee


then ogier heaved over his head
his huge round shield of proof
but mark set one foot on the shield
one on some sundered rock upheeled
and towered above the tossing field
a statue on a roof


dealing far blows about the fight
like thunderbolts aroam
like birds about the battlefield
while ogier writhed under his shield
like a tortoise in his dome


but hate in the buried ogier
was strong as pain in hell
with bare brute hand from the inside
he burst the shield of brass and hide
and a deathstroke to the romans side
sent suddenly and well


then the great statue on the shield
looked his last look around
with level and imperial eye
and mark the man from italy
fell in the sea of agony
and died without a sound


and ogier leaping up alive
hurled his huge shield away
flying as when a juggler flings
a whizzing plate in play


and held two arms up rigidly
and roared to all the danes
fallen is rome yea fallen
the city of the plains


shall no man born remember
that breaketh wood or weald
how long she stood on the roof of the world
as he stood on my shield


the new wild world forgetteth her
as foam fades on the sea
how long she stood with her foot on man
as he with his foot on me


no more shall the brown men of the south
move like the ants in lines
to quiet men with olives
or madden men with vines


no more shall the white towns of the south
where tiber and nilus run
sitting around a secret sea
worship a secret sun


the blind gods roar for rome fallen
and forum and garland gone
for the ice of the north is broken
and the sea of the north comes on


the blind gods roar and rave and dream
of all cities under the sea
for the heart of the north is broken
and the blood of the north is free


down from the dome of the world we come
rivers on rivers down
under us swirl the sects and hordes
and the high dooms we drown


down from the dome of the world and down
struck flying as a skiff
on a river in spate is spun and swirled
until we come to the end of the world
that breaks short like a cliff


and when we come to the end of the world
for me i count it fit
to take the leap like a good river
shot shrieking over it


but whatso hap at the end of the world
where nothing is struck and sounds
it is not by thor these monkish men
these humbled wessex hounds


not this pale line of christian hinds
this one white string of men
shall keep us back from the end of the world
and the things that happen then


it is not alfreds dwarfish sword
nor egberts pigmy crown
shall stay us now that descend in thunder
rending the realms and the realms thereunder
down through the world and down


there was that in the wild men back of him
there was that in his own wild song
a dizzy throbbing a drunkard smoke
that dazed to death all wessex folk
and swept their spears along


vainly the sword of colan
and the axe of alfred plied
the danes poured in like a brainless plague
and knew not when they died


prince colan slew a score of them
and was stricken to his knee
king alfred slew a score and seven
and was borne back on a tree


back to the black gate of the woods
back up the single way
back by the place of the parting ways
christs knights were whirled away


and when they came to the parting ways
dooms heaviest hammer fell
for the king was beaten blind at bay
down the right lane with his array
but colan swept the other way
where he smote great strokes and fell


the thornwoods over ethandune
stand sharp and thick as spears
by night and furze and forestharms
far sundered were the friends in arms
the loud lost blows the last alarms
came not to alfreds ears


the thornwoods over ethandune
stand stiff as spikes in mail
as to the haut king came at morn
dead roland on a doubtful horn
seemed unto alfred lightly borne
the last cry of the gael


away in the waste of white horse down
an idle child alone
played some small game through hours that pass
and patiently would pluck the grass
patiently push the stone


on the lean green edge for ever
where the blank chalk touched the turf
the child played on alone divine
as a child plays on the last line
that sunders sand and surf


for he dwelleth in high divisions
too simple to understand
seeing on what morn of mystery
the uncreated rent the sea
with roarings from the land


through the long infant hours like days
he built one tower in vain
piled up small stones to make a town
and evermore the stones fell down
and he piled them up again


and crimson kings on battletowers
and saints on gothic spires
and hermits on their peaks of snow
and heroes on their pyres


and patriots riding royally
that rush the rocking town
stretch hands and hunger and aspire
seeking to mount where high and higher
the child whom time can never tire
sings over white horse down


and this was the might of alfred
at the ending of the way
that of such smiters wise or wild
he was least distant from the child
piling the stones all day


for eldred fought like a frank hunter
that killeth and goeth home
and mark had fought because all arms
rang like the name of rome


and colan fought with a double mind
moody and madly gay
but alfred fought as gravely
as a good child at play


he saw wheels break and work run back
and all things as they were
and his heart was orbed like victory
and simple like despair


therefore is mark forgotten
that was wise with his tongue and brave
and the cairn over colan crumbled
and the cross on eldreds grave


their great souls went on a wind away
and they have not tale or tomb
and alfred born in wantage
rules england till the doom


because in the forest of all fears
like a strange fresh gust from sea
struck him that ancient innocence
that is more than mastery


and as a child whose bricks fall down
repiles them oer and oer
came ruin and the rain that burns
returning as a wheel returns
and crouching in the furze and ferns
he began his life once more


he took his ivory horn unslung
and smiled but not in scorn
endeth the battle of ethandune
with the blowing of a horn


on a dark horse at the double way
he saw great guthrum ride
heard roar of brass and ring of steel
the laughter and the trumpet peal
the pagan in his pride


and ogiers red and hated head
moved in some talk or task
but the men seemed scattered in the brier
and some of them had lit a fire
and one had broached a cask


and waggons one or two stood up
like tall ships in sight
as if an outpost were encamped
at the cloven ways for night


and joyous of the sudden stay
of alfreds routed few
sat one upon a stone to sigh
and some slipped up the road to fly
till alfred in the fern hard by
set horn to mouth and blew


and they all abode like statues
one sitting on the stone
one halfway through the thorn hedge tall
one with a leg across a wall
and one looked backwards very small
far up the road alone


grey twilight and a yellow star
hung over thorn and hill
two spears and a cloven warshield lay
loose on the road as cast away
the horn died faint in the forest grey
and the fleeing men stood still


brothers at arms said alfred
on this side lies the foe
are slavery and starvation flowers
that you should pluck them so


for whether is it better
to be prodded with danish poles
having hewn a chamber in a ditch
and hounded like a howling witch
or smoked to death in holes


or that before the red cock crow
all we a thousand strong
go down the dark road to gods house
singing a wessex song


to sweat a slave to a race of slaves
to drink up infamy
no brothers by your leave i think
death is a better ale to drink
and by all the stars of christ that sink
the danes shall drink with me


to grow old cowed in a conquered land
with the sun itself discrowned
to see trees crouch and cattle slink
death is a better ale to drink
and by high death on the fell brink
that flagon shall go round


though dead are all the paladins
whom glory had in ken
though all your thundersworded thanes
with proud hearts died among the danes
while a man remains great war remains
now is a war of men


the men that tear the furrows
the men that fell the trees
when all their lords be lost and dead
the bondsmen of the earth shall tread
the tyrants of the seas


the wheel of the roaring stillness
of all labours under the sun
speed the wild work as well at least
as the whole worlds work is done


let hildred hack the shieldwall
clean as he hacks the hedge
let gurth the fowler stand as cool
as he stands on the chasms edge


let gorlias ride the seakings
as gorlias rides the sea
then let all hell and denmark drive
yelling to all its fiends alive
and not a rag care we


when alfreds word was ended
stood firm that feeble line
each in his place with club or spear
and fury deeper than deep fear
and smiles as sour as brine


and the king held up the horn and said
see ye my fathers horn
that egbert blew in his empery
once when he rode out commonly
twice when he rode for venery
and thrice on the battlemorn


but heavier fates have fallen
the horn of the wessex kings
and i blew once the riding sign
to call you to the fighting line
and glory and all good things


and now two blasts the hunting sign
because we turn to bay
but i will not blow the three blasts
till we be lost or they


and now i blow the hunting sign
charge some by rule and rod
but when i blow the battle sign
charge all and go to god


wild stared the danes at the double ways
where they loitered all at large
as that dark line for the last time
doubled the knee to charge


and caught their weapons clumsily
and marvelled how and why
in such degree by rule and rod
the people of the peace of god
went roaring down to die


and when the last arrow
was fitted and was flown
when the broken shield hung on the breast
and the hopeless lance was laid in rest
and the hopeless horn blown


the king looked up and what he saw
was a great light like death
for our lady stood on the standards rent
as lonely and as innocent
as when between white walls she went
and the lilies of nazareth


one instant in a still light
he saw our lady then
her dress was soft as western sky
and she was a queen most womanly
but she was a queen of men


over the iron forest
he saw our lady stand
her eyes were sad withouten art
and seven swords were in her heart
but one was in her hand


then the last charge went blindly
and all too lost for fear
the danes closed round a roaring ring
and twenty clubs rose oer the king
four danes hewed at him halloing
and ogier of the stone and sling
drove at him with a spear


but the danes were wild with laughter
and the great spear swung wide
the point stuck to a straggling tree
and either host cried suddenly
as alfred leapt aside


short time had shaggy ogier
to pull his lance in line
he knew king alfreds axe on high
he heard it rushing through the sky


he cowered beneath it with a cry
it split him to the spine
and alfred sprang over him dead
and blew the battle sign


then bursting all and blasting
came christendom like death
kicked of such catapults of will
the staves shiver the barrels spill
the waggons waver and crash and kill
the waggoners beneath


barriers go backwards banners rend
great shields groan like a gong
horses like horns of nightmare
neigh horribly and long


horses ramp high and rock and boil
and break their golden reins
and slide on carnage clamorously
down where the bitter blood doth lie
where ogier went on foot to die
in the old way of the danes


the high tide king alfred cried
the high tide and the turn
as a tide turns on the tall grey seas
see how they waver in the trees
how stray their spears how knock their knees
how wild their watchfires burn


the mother of god goes over them
walking on wind and flame
and the stormcloud drifts from city and dale
and the white horse stamps in the white horse vale
and we all shall yet drink christian ale
in the village of our name


the mother of god goes over them
on dreadful cherubs borne
and the psalm is roaring above the rune
and the cross goes over the sun and moon
endeth the battle of ethandune
with the blowing of a horn


for back indeed disorderly
the danes went clamouring
too worn to take anew the tale
or dazed with insolence and ale
or stunned of heaven or stricken pale
before the face of the king


for dire was alfred in his hour
the pale scribe witnesseth
more mighty in defeat was he
than all men else in victory
and behind his men came murderously
drythroated drinking death


and edgar of the golden ship
he slew with his own hand
took ludwig from his ladys bower
and smote down harmar in his hour
and vain and lonely stood the tower
the tower in guelderland


and torr out of his tiny boat
whose eyes beheld the nile
wulf with his warcry on his lips
and harco born in the eclipse
who blocked the seine with battleships
round paris on the isle


and hacon of the harvestsong
and dirck from the elbe he slew
and cnut that melted durham bell
and fulk and fiery oscar fell
and goderic and sigael
and uriel of the yew


and highest sang the slaughter
and fastest fell the slain
when from the woodroads blackening throat
a crowning and crashing wonder smote
the rearguard of the dane


for the dregs of colans company
lost down the other road
had gathered and grown and heard the din
and with wild yells came pouring in
naked as their old british kin
and bright with blood for woad


and bare and bloody and aloft
they bore before their band
the body of the mighty lord
colan of caerleon and its horde
that bore king alfreds battlesword
broken in his left hand


and a strange music went with him
loud and yet strangely far
the wild pipes of the western land
too keen for the ear to understand
sang high and deathly on each hand
when the dead man went to war


blocked between ghost and buccaneer
brave men have dropped and died
and the wild sealords well might quail
as the ghastly warpipes of the gael
called to the horns of white horse vale
and all the horns replied


and hildred the poor hedger
cut down four captains dead
and halmar laid three others low
and the great earls wavered to and fro
for the living and the dead


and gorlias grasped the great flag
the raven of odin torn
and the eyes of guthrum altered
for the first time since morn


as a turn of the wheel of tempest
tilts up the whole sky tall
and cliffs of wan cloud luminous
lean out like great walls over us
as if the heavens might fall


as such a tall and tilted sky
sends certain snow or light
so did the eyes of guthrum change
and the turn was more certain and more strange
than a thousand men in flight


for not till the floor of the skies is split
and hellfire shines through the sea
or the stars look up through the rent earths knees
cometh such rending of certainties
as when one wise man truly sees
what is more wise than he


he set his horse in the battlebreech
even guthrum of the dane
and as ever had fallen fell his brand
a falling tower oer many a land
but gurth the fowler laid one hand
upon this bridle rein


king guthrum was a great lord
and higher than his gods
he put the popes to laughter
he chid the saints with rods


he took this hollow world of ours
for a cup to hold his wine
in the parting of the woodways
there came to him a sign


in wessex in the forest
in the breaking of the spears
we set a sign on guthrum
to blaze a thousand years


where the high saddles jostle
and the horsetails toss
there rose to the birds flying
a roar of dead and dying
in deafness and strong crying
we signed him with the cross


far out to the winding river
the blood ran down for days
when we put the cross on guthrum
in the parting of the ways


in the years of the peace of wessex
when the good king sat at home
years following on that bloody boon
when she that stands above the moon
stood above death at ethandune
and saw his kingdom come


when the pagan people of the sea
fled to their palisades
nailed there with javelins to cling
and wonder smote the pirate king
and brought him to his christening
and the end of all his raids


for not till the nights blue slate is wiped
of its last star utterly
and fierce new signs writ there to read
shall eyes with such amazement heed
as when a great man knows indeed
a greater thing than he


and there came to his chrismloosing
lords of all lands afar
and a line was drawn northwesterly
that set king egberts empire free
giving all lands by the northern sea
to the sons of the northern star


in the days of the rest of alfred
when all these things were done
and wessex lay in a patch of peace
like a dog in a patch of sun


the king sat in his orchard
among apples green and red
with the little book in his bosom
and the sunshine on his head


and he gathered the songs of simple men
that swing with helm and hod
and the alms he gave as a christian
like a river alive with fishes ran
and he made gifts to a beggar man
as to a wandering god


and he gat good laws of the ancient kings
like treasure out of the tombs
and many a thief in thorny nook
or noble in seastained turret shook
for the opening of his iron book
and the gathering of the dooms


then men would come from the ends of the earth
whom the king sat welcoming
and men would go to the ends of the earth
because of the word of the king


for folk came in to alfreds face
whose javelins had been hurled
on monsters that make boil the sea
crakens and coils of mystery
or thrust in ancient snows that be
the white hair of the world


and some had knocked at the northern gates
of the ultimate icy floor
where the fish freeze and the foam turns black
and the wide world narrows to a track
and the other sea at the worlds back
cries through a closed door


and men went forth from alfreds face
even great giftbearing lords
not to rome only but more bold
out to the high hot courts of old
of negroes clad in cloth of gold
silence and crooked swords


scrawled screens and secret gardens
and insectladen skies
where fiery plains stretch on and on
to the purple country of prester john
and the walls of paradise


and he knew the might of the terre majeure
where kings began to reign
where in a nightrout without name
of gloomy goths and gauls there came
white above candles all aflame
like a vision charlemagne


and men seeing such embassies
spake with the king and said
the steel that sang so sweet a tune
on ashdown and on ethandune
why hangs it scabbarded so soon
all heavily like lead


why dwell the danes in north england
and up to the river ride
three more such marches like thine own
would end them and the pict should own
our sway and our feet climb the throne
in the mountains of strathclyde


and alfred in the orchard
among apples green and red
with the little book in his bosom
looked at green leaves and said


when all philosophies shall fail
this word alone shall fit
that a sage feels too small for life
and a fool too large for it


asia and all imperial plains
are too little for a fool
but for one man whose eyes can see
the little island of athelney
is too large a land to rule


haply it had been better
when i built my fortress there
out in the reedy waters wide
i had stood on my mud wall and cried
take england all from tide to tide
be athelney my share


those madmen of the thronescramble
oppressors and oppressed
had lined the banks by athelney
and waved and wailed unceasingly
where the river turned to the broad sea
by an island of the blest


an island like a little book
full of a hundred tales
like the gilt page the good monks pen
that is all smaller than a wren
yet hath high towns meteors and men
and suns and spouting whales


a land having a light on it
in the river dark and fast
an isle with utter clearness lit
because a saint had stood in it
where flowers are flowers indeed and fit
and trees are trees at last


so were the island of a saint
but i am a common king
and i will make my fences tough
from wantage town to plymouth bluff
because i am not wise enough
to rule so small a thing


and it fell in the days of alfred
in the days of his repose
that as old customs in his sight
were a straight road and a steady light
he bade them keep the white horse white
as the first plume of the snows


and right to the red torchlight
from the trouble of morning grey
they stripped the white horse of the grass
as they strip it to this day


and under the red torchlight
he went dreaming as though dull
of his old companions slain like kings
and the rich irrevocable things
of a heart that hath not openings
but is shut fast being full


and the torchlight touched the pale hair
where silver clouded gold
and the frame of his face was made of cords
and a young lord turned among the lords
and said the king is old


and even as he said it
a post ran in amain
crying arm lord king the hamlets arm
in the horror and the shade of harm
they have burnt brand of ayngers farm
the danes are come again


danes drive the white east angles
in six fights on the plains
danes waste the world about the thames
danes to the eastwarddanes


and as he stumbled on one knee
the thanes broke out in ire
crying ill the watchmen watch and ill
the sheriffs keep the shire


but the young earl said ill the saints
the saints of england guard
the land wherein we pledge them gold
the dykes decay the king grows old
and surely this is hard


that we be never quit of them
that when his head is hoar
he cannot say to them he smote
and spared with a hand hard at the throat
go and return no more


then alfred smiled and the smile of him
was like the sun for power
but he only pointed bade them heed
those peasants of the berkshire breed
who plucked the old horse of the weed
as they pluck it to this hour


will ye part with the weeds for ever
or show daisies to the door
or will you bid the bold grass
go and return no more


so ceaseless and so secret
thrive terror and theft set free
treason and shame shall come to pass
while one weed flowers in a morass
and like the stillness of stiff grass
the stillness of tyranny


over our white souls also
wild heresies and high
wave prouder than the plumes of grass
and sadder than their sigh


and i go riding against the raid
and ye know not where i am
but ye shall know in a day or year
when one green star of grass grows here
chaos has charged you charger and spear
battleaxe and batteringram


and though skies alter and empires melt
this word shall still be true
if we would have the horse of old
scour ye the horse anew


one time i followed a dancing star
that seemed to sing and nod
and ring upon earth all evils knell
but now i wot if ye scour not well
red rust shall grow on gods great bell
and grass in the streets of god


ceased alfred and above his head
the grand green domes the downs
showed the first legions of the press
marching in haste and bitterness
for christs sake and the crowns


beyond the cavern of colan
past eldreds by the sea
rose men that owned king alfreds rod
from the windy wastes of exe untrod
or where the thorn of the grave of god
burns over glastonbury


far northward and far westward
the distant tribes drew nigh
plains beyond plains fell beyond fell
that a man at sunset sees so well
and the tiny coloured towns that dwell
in the corners of the sky


but dark and thick as thronged the host
with drum and torch and blade
the stilleyed king sat pondering
as one that watches a live thing
the scoured chalk and he said


though i give this land to our lady
that helped me in athelney
though lordlier trees and lustier sod
and happier hills hath no flesh trod
than the garden of the mother of god
between thames side and the sea


i know that weeds shall grow in it
faster than men can burn
and though they scatter now and go
in some far century sad and slow
i have a vision and i know
the heathen shall return


they shall not come with warships
they shall not waste with brands
but books be all their eating
and ink be on their hands


not with the humour of hunters
or savage skill in war
but ordering all things with dead words
strings shall they make of beasts and birds
and wheels of wind and star


they shall come mild as monkish clerks
with many a scroll and pen
and backward shall ye turn and gaze
desiring one of alfreds days
when pagans still were men


the dear sun dwarfed of dreadful suns
like fiercer flowers on stalk
earth lost and little like a pea
in high heavens towering forestry
these be the small weeds ye shall see
crawl covering the chalk


but though they bridge st marys sea
or steal st michaels wing
though they rear marvels over us
greater than great vergilius
wrought for the roman king


by this sign you shall know them
the breaking of the sword
and man no more a free knight
that loves or hates his lord


yea this shall be the sign of them
the sign of the dying fire
and man made like a halfwit
that knows not of his sire


what though they come with scroll and pen
and grave as a shaven clerk
by this sign you shall know them
that they ruin and make dark


by all men bond to nothing
being slaves without a lord
by one blind idiot world obeyed
too blind to be abhorred


by terror and the cruel tales
of curse in bone and kin
by weird and weakness winning
accursed from the beginning
by detail of the sinning
and denial of the sin


by thought a crawling ruin
by life a leaping mire
by a broken heart in the breast of the world
and the end of the worlds desire


by god and man dishonoured
by death and life made vain
know ye the old barbarian
the barbarian come again


when is great talk of trend and tide
and wisdom and destiny
hail that undying heathen
that is sadder than the sea


in what wise men shall smite him
or the cross stand up again
or charity or chivalry
my vision saith not and i see
no more but now ride doubtfully
to the battle of the plain


and the grassedge of the great down
was cut clean as a lawn
while the levies thronged from near and far
from the warm woods of the western star
and the king went out to his last war
on a tall grey horse at dawn


and news of his faroff fighting
came slowly and brokenly
from the land of the east saxons
from the sunrise and the sea


from the plains of the white sunrise
and sad st edmunds crown
where the pools of essex pale and gleam
out beyond london town


in mighty and doubtful fragments
like faint or fabled wars
climbed the old hills of his renown
where the bald brow of white horse down
is close to the cold stars


but away in the eastern places
the wind of death walked high
and a raid was driven athwart the raid
the sky reddened and the smoke swayed
and the tall grey horse went by


the gates of the great river
were breached as with a barge
the walls sank crowded say the scribes
and high towers populous with tribes
seemed leaning from the charge


smoke like rebellious heavens rolled
curled over coloured flames
mirrored in monstrous purple dreams
in the mighty pools of thames


loud was the war on london wall
and loud in london gates
and loud the seakings in the cloud
broke through their dreaming gods and loud
cried on their dreadful fates


and all the while on white horse hill
the horse lay long and wan
the turf crawled and the fungus crept
and the little sorrel while all men slept
unwrought the work of man


with velvet finger velvet foot
the fierce soft mosses then
crept on the large white commonweal
all folk had striven to strip and peel
and the grass like a great green witchs wheel
unwound the toils of men


and clover and silent thistle throve
and buds burst silently
with little care for the thames valley
or what things there might be


that away on the widening river
in the eastern plains for crown
stood up in the pale purple sky
one turret of smoke like ivory
and the smoke changed and the wind went by
and the king took london town


white founts falling in the courts of the sun
and the soldan of byzantium is smiling as they run
there is laughter like the fountains in that face of all men feared
it stirs the forest darkness the darkness of his beard
it curls the bloodred crescent the crescent of his lips
for the inmost sea of all the earth is shaken with his ships
they have dared the white republics up the capes of italy
they have dashed the adriatic round the lion of the sea
and the pope has cast his arms abroad for agony and loss
and called the kings of christendom for swords about the cross
the cold queen of england is looking in the glass
the shadow of the valois is yawning at the mass
from evening isles fantastical rings faint the spanish gun
and the lord upon the golden horn is laughing in the sun


dim drums throbbing in the hills half heard
where only on a nameless throne a crownless prince has stirred
where risen from a doubtful seat and halfattainted stall
the last knight of europe takes weapons from the wall
the last and lingering troubadour to whom the bird has sung
that once went singing southward when all the world was young
in that enormous silence tiny and unafraid
comes up along a winding road the noise of the crusade
strong gongs groaning as the guns boom far
don john of austria is going to the war
stiff flags straining in the nightblasts cold
in the gloom blackpurple in the glint oldgold
torchlight crimson on the copper kettledrums
then the tuckets then the trumpets then the cannon and he comes
don john laughing in the brave beard curled
spurning of his stirrups like the thrones of all the world


holding his head up for a flag of all the free
lovelight of spain hurrah
deathlight of africa
don john of austria
is riding to the sea


mahound is in his paradise above the evening star
don john of austria is going to the war
he moves a mighty turban on the timeless houris knees
his turban that is woven of the sunset and the seas
he shakes the peacock gardens as he rises from his ease
and he strides among the treetops and is taller than the trees


and his voice through all the garden is a thunder sent to bring
black azrael and ariel and ammon on the wing
giants and the genii
multiplex of wing and eye
whose strong obedience broke the sky
when solomon was king


they rush in red and purple from the red clouds of the morn
from temples where the yellow gods shut up their eyes in scorn
they rise in green robes roaring from the green hells of the sea
where fallen skies and evil hues and eyeless creatures be
on them the seavalves cluster and the grey seaforests curl
splashed with a splendid sickness the sickness of the pearl
they swell in sapphire smoke out of the blue cracks of the ground
they gather and they wonder and give worship to mahound
and he saith break up the mountains where the hermitfolk may hide
and sift the red and silver sands lest bone of saint abide
and chase the giaours flying night and day not giving rest
for that which was our trouble comes again out of the west
we have set the seal of solomon on all things under sun
of knowledge and of sorrow and endurance of things done
but a noise is in the mountains in the mountains and i know
the voice that shook our palaces four hundred years ago
it is he that saith not kismet it is he that knows not fate
it is richard it is raymond it is godfrey in the gate
it is he whose loss is laughter when he counts the wager worth
put down your feet upon him that our peace be on the earth


for he heard drums groaning and he heard guns jar
don john of austria is going to the war
sudden and still hurrah
bolt from iberia
don john of austria
is gone by alcalar


st michaels on his mountain in the searoads of the north
don john of austria is girt and going forth
where the grey seas glitter and the sharp tides shift
and the seafolk labour and the red sails lift
he shakes his lance of iron and he claps his wings of stone
the noise is gone through normandy the noise is gone alone
the north is full of tangled things and texts and aching eyes
and dead is all the innocence of anger and surprise
and christian killeth christian in a narrow dusty room
and christian dreadeth christ that bath a newer face of doom
and christian hateth mary that god kissed in galilee
but don john of austria is riding to the sea


don john calling through the blast and the eclipse
crying with the trumpet with the trumpet of his lips
trumpet that sayeth ha
domino gloria
don john of austria
is shouting to the ships


king philips in his closet with the fleece about his neck
don john of austria is armed upon the deck
the walls are hung with velvet that is black and soft as sin
and little dwarfs creep out of it and little dwarfs creep in
he holds a crystal phial that has colours like the moon
he touches and it tingles and he trembles very soon
and his face is as a fungus of a leprous white and grey
like plants in the high houses that are shuttered from the day
and death is in the phial and the end of noble work
but don john of austria has fired upon the turk


don johns hunting and his hounds have bayed
booms away past italy the rumour of his raid
gun upon gun ha ha
gun upon gun hurrah
don john of austria
has loosed the cannonade


the pope was in his chapel before day or battle broke
don john of austria is hidden in the smoke
the hidden room in a mans house where god sits all the year
the secret window whence the world looks small and very dear
he sees as in a mirror on the monstrous twilight sea
the crescent of his cruel ships whose name is mystery
they fling great shadows foewards making cross and castle dark
they veil the plumed lions on the galleys of st mark
and above the ships are palaces of brown blackbearded chiefs
and below the ships are prisons where with multitudinous griefs
christian captives sick and sunless all a labouring race repines
like a race in sunken cities like a nation in the mines
they are lost like slaves that swat and in the skies of morning hung
the stairways of the tallest gods when tyranny was young


they are countless voiceless hopeless as those fallen or fleeing on
before the high kings horses in the granite of babylon
and many a one grows witless in his quiet room in hell
where a yellow face looks inward through the lattice of his cell
and he finds his god forgotten and he seeks no more a sign
but don john of austria has burst the battleline
don john pounding from the slaughterpainted poop
purpling all the ocean like a bloody pirates sloop
scarlet running over on the silvers and the golds
breaking of the hatches up and bursting of the holds


thronging of the thousands up that labour under sea
white for bliss and blind for sun and stunned for liberty
vivat hispania
domino gloria
don john of austria
has set his people free


cervantes on his galley sets the sword back in the sheath
don john of austria rides homeward with a wreath
and he sees across a weary land a straggling road in spain
up which a lean and foolish knight forever rides in vain
and he smiles but not as sultans smile and settles back the blade
but don john of austria rides home from the crusade


it is an ancyent marinere
and he stoppeth one of three
by thy long grey beard and thy glittering eye
now wherefore stoppest me


the bridegrooms doors are opend wide
and i am next of kin
the guests are met the feast is set
mayst hear the merry din


but still he holds the weddingguest
there was a ship quoth he
nay if thoust got a laughsome tale
marinere come with me


he holds him with his skinny hand
quoth he there was a ship
now get thee hence thou greybeard loon
or my staff shall make thee skip


he holds him with his glittering eye
the wedding guest stood still
and listens like a three years child
the marinere hath his will


the weddingguest sate on a stone
he cannot chuse but hear
and thus spake on that ancyent man
the brighteyed marinere


the ship was cheerd the harbour cleard
merrily did we drop
below the kirk below the hill
below the lighthouse top


the sun came up upon the left
out of the sea came he
and he shone bright and on the right
went down into the sea


higher and higher every day
till over the mast at noon
the weddingguest here beat his breast
for he heard the loud bassoon


the bride hath pacd into the hall
red as a rose is she
nodding their heads before her goes
the merry minstralsy


the weddingguest he beat his breast
yet he cannot chuse but hear
and thus spake on that ancyent man
the brighteyed marinere


listen stranger storm and wind
a wind and tempest strong
for days and weeks it playd us freaks
like chaff we drove along


listen stranger mist and snow
and it grew wondrous cauld
and ice masthigh came floating by
as green as emerauld


and thro the drifts the snowy clifts
did send a dismal sheen
ne shapes of men ne beasts we ken
the ice was all between


the ice was here the ice was there
the ice was all around
it crackd and growld and roard and howld
like noises of a swound


at length did cross an albatross
thorough the fog it came
and an it were a christian soul
we haild it in gods name


the marineres gave it biscuitworms
and round and round it flew
the ice did split with a thunderfit
the helmsman steerd us thro


and a good south wind sprung up behind
the albatross did follow
and every day for food or play
came to the marineres hollo


in mist or cloud on mast or shroud
it perchd for vespers nine
whiles all the night thro fogsmoke white
glimmerd the white moonshine


god save thee ancyent marinere
from the fiends that plague thee thus
why lookst thou sowith my cross bow
i shot the albatross


the sun came up upon the right
out of the sea came he
and broad as a weft upon the left
went down into the sea


and the good south wind still blew behind
but no sweet bird did follow
ne any day for food or play
came to the marineres hollo


and i had done an hellish thing
and it would work em woe
for all averrd i had killd the bird
that made the breeze to blow


ne dim ne red like gods own head
the glorious sun uprist
then all averrd i had killd the bird
that brought the fog and mist
twas right said they such birds to slay
that bring the fog and mist


the breezes blew the white foam flew
the furrow followd free
we were the first that ever burst
into that silent sea


down dropt the breeze the sails dropt down
twas sad as sad could be
and we did speak only to break
the silence of the sea


all in a hot and copper sky
the bloody sun at noon
right up above the mast did stand
no bigger than the moon


day after day day after day
we stuck ne breath ne motion
as idle as a painted ship
upon a painted ocean


water water every where
and all the boards did shrink
water water every where
ne any drop to drink


the very deeps did rot o christ
that ever this should be
yea slimy things did crawl with legs
upon the slimy sea


about about in reel and rout
the deathfires dancd at night
the water like a witchs oils
burnt green and blue and white


and some in dreams assured were
of the spirit that plagued us so
nine fathom deep he had followd us
from the land of mist and snow


and every tongue thro utter drouth
was witherd at the root
we could not speak no more than if
we had been choked with soot


ah weladay what evil looks
had i from old and young
instead of the cross the albatross
about my neck was hung


i saw a something in the sky
no bigger than my fist
at first it seemd a little speck
and then it seemd a mist
it movd and movd and took at last
a certain shape i wist


a speck a mist a shape i wist
and still it nerd and nerd
and an it dodgd a watersprite
it plungd and tackd and veerd


with throat unslackd with black lips bakd
ne could we laugh ne wail
then while thro drouth all dumb they stood
i bit my arm and suckd the blood
and cryd a sail a sail


with throat unslackd with black lips bakd
agape they heard me call
gramercy they for joy did grin
and all at once their breath drew in
as they were drinking all


she doth not tack from side to side
hither to work us weal
withouten wind withouten tide
she steddies with upright keel


the western wave was all a flame
the day was well nigh done
almost upon the western wave
rested the broad bright sun
when that strange shape drove suddenly
betwixt us and the sun


and strait the sun was fleckd with bars
heavens mother send us grace
as if thro a dungeon grate he peerd
with broad and burning face


alas thought i and my heart beat loud
how fast she neres and neres
are those _her_ sails that glance in the sun
like restless gossameres


are these _her_ naked ribs which fleckd
the sun that did behind them peer
and are these two all all the crew
that woman and her fleshless pheere


_his_ bones were black with many a crack
all black and bare i ween
jetblack and bare save where with rust
of mouldy damps and charnel crust
theyre patchd with purple and green


_her_ lips are red _her_ looks are free
_her_ locks are yellow as gold
her skin is as white as leprosy
and she is far liker death than he
her flesh makes the still air cold


the naked hulk alongside came
and the twain were playing dice
the game is done ive won ive won
quoth she and whistled thrice


a gust of wind sterte up behind
and whistled thro his bones
thro the holes of his eyes and the hole of his mouth
halfwhistles and halfgroans


with never a whisper in the sea
off darts the spectreship
while clombe above the eastern bar
the horned moon with one bright star
almost atween the tips


one after one by the horned moon
listen o stranger to me
each turnd his face with a ghastly pang
and cursd me with his ee


four times fifty living men
with never a sigh or groan
with heavy thump a lifeless lump
they droppd down one by one


their souls did from their bodies fly
they fled to bliss or woe
and every soul it passd me by
like the whiz of my crossbow


i fear thee ancyent marinere
i fear thy skinny hand
and thou art long and lank and brown
as is the ribbd seasand


i fear thee and thy glittering eye
and thy skinny hand so brown
fear not fear not thou wedding guest
this body dropt not down


alone alone all all alone
alone on the wide wide sea
and christ would take no pity on
my soul in agony


the many men so beautiful
and they all dead did lie
and a million million slimy things
livd onand so did i


i lookd upon the rotting sea
and drew my eyes away
i lookd upon the eldritch deck
and there the dead men lay


i lookd to heaven and tryd to pray
but or ever a prayer had gusht
a wicked whisper came and made
my heart as dry as dust


i closd my lids and kept them close
till the balls like pulses beat
for the sky and the sea and the sea and the sky
lay like a load on my weary eye
and the dead were at my feet


the cold sweat melted from their limbs
ne rot ne reek did they
the look with which they lookd on me
had never passd away


an orphans curse would drag to hell
a spirit from on high
but o more horrible than that
is the curse in a dead mans eye
seven days seven nights i saw that curse
and yet i could not die


the moving moon went up the sky
and no where did abide
softly she was going up
and a star or two beside


her beams bemockd the sultry main
like morning frosts yspread
but where the ships huge shadow lay
the charmed water burnt alway
a still and awful red


beyond the shadow of the ship
i watchd the watersnakes
they movd in tracks of shining white
and when they reard the elfish light
fell off in hoary flakes


within the shadow of the ship
i watchd their rich attire
blue glossy green and velvet black
they coild and swam and every track
was a flash of golden fire


o happy living things no tongue
their beauty might declare
a spring of love gusht from my heart
and i blessd them unaware
sure my kind saint took pity on me
and i blessd them unaware


the selfsame moment i could pray
and from my neck so free
the albatross fell off and sank
like lead into the sea


o sleep it is a gentle thing
belovd from pole to pole
to maryqueen the praise be yeven
she sent the gentle sleep from heaven
that slid into my soul


the silly buckets on the deck
that had so long remaind
i dreamt that they were filld with dew
and when i awoke it raind


my lips were wet my throat was cold
my garments all were dank
sure i had drunken in my dreams
and still my body drank


i movd and could not feel my limbs
i was so light almost
i thought that i had died in sleep
and was a blessed ghost


the roaring wind it roard far off
it did not come anear
but with its sound it shook the sails
that were so thin and sere


the upper air bursts into life
and a hundred fireflags sheen
to and fro they are hurried about
and to and fro and in and out
the stars dance on between


the coming wind doth roar more loud
the sails do sigh like sedge
the rain pours down from one black cloud
and the moon is at its edge


hark hark the thick black cloud is cleft
and the moon is at its side
like waters shot from some high crag
the lightning falls with never a jag
a river steep and wide


the strong wind reachd the ship it roard
and droppd down like a stone
beneath the lightning and the moon
the dead men gave a groan


they groand they stirrd they all uprose
ne spake ne movd their eyes
it had been strange even in a dream
to have seen those dead men rise


the helmsman steerd the ship movd on
yet never a breeze upblew
the marineres all gan work the ropes
where they were wont to do
they raisd their limbs like lifeless tools
we were a ghastly crew


the body of my brothers son
stood by me knee to knee
the body and i pulld at one rope
but he said nought to me
and i quakd to think of my own voice
how frightful it would be


the daylight dawndthey droppd their arms
and clusterd round the mast
sweet sounds rose slowly thro their mouths
and from their bodies passd


around around flew each sweet sound
then darted to the sun
slowly the sounds came back again
now mixd now one by one


sometimes a dropping from the sky
i heard the lavrock sing
sometimes all little birds that are
how they seemd to fill the sea and air
with their sweet jargoning


and now twas like all instruments
now like a lonely flute
and now it is an angels song
that makes the heavens be mute


it ceasd yet still the sails made on
a pleasant noise till noon
a noise like of a hidden brook
in the leafy month of june
that to the sleeping woods all night
singeth a quiet tune


listen o listen thou weddingguest
marinere thou hast thy will
for that which comes out of thine eye doth make
my body and soul to be still


never sadder tale was told
to a man of woman born
sadder and wiser thou weddingguest
thoult rise to morrow morn


never sadder tale was heard
by a man of woman born
the marineres all returnd to work
as silent as beforne


the marineres all gan pull the ropes
but look at me they nold
thought i i am as thin as air
they cannot me behold


till moon we silently saild on
yet never a breeze did breathe
slowly and smoothly went the ship
movd onward from beneath


under the keel nine fathom deep
from the land of mist and snow
the spirit slid and it was he
that made the ship to go
the sails at noon left off their tune
and the ship stood still also


the sun right up above the mast
had fixd her to the ocean
but in a minute she gan stir
with a short uneasy motion
backwards and forwards half her length
with a short uneasy motion


then like a pawing horse let go
she made a sudden bound
it flung the blood into my head
and i fell into a swound


how long in that same fit i lay
i have not to declare
but ere my living life returnd
i heard and in my soul discernd
two voices in the air


is it he quoth one is this the man
by him who died on cross
with his cruel bow he layd full low
the harmless albatross


the spirit who bideth by himself
in the land of mist and snow
he lovd the bird that lovd the man
who shot him with his bow


the other was a softer voice
as soft as honeydew
quoth he the man hath penance done
and penance more will do


but tell me tell me speak again
thy soft response renewing
what makes that ship drive on so fast
what is the ocean doing


still as a slave before his lord
the ocean hath no blast
his great bright eye most silently
up to the moon is cast


if he may know which way to go
for she guides him smooth or grim
see brother see how graciously
she looketh down on him


but why drives on that ship so fast
withouten wave or wind
the air is cut away before
and closes from behind


fly brother fly more high more high
or we shall be belated
for slow and slow that ship will go
when the marineres trance is abated


i woke and we were sailing on
as in a gentle weather
twas night calm night the moon was high
the dead men stood together


all stood together on the deck
for a charneldungeon fitter
all fixd on me their stony eyes
that in the moon did glitter


the pang the curse with which they died
had never passd away
i could not draw my een from theirs
ne turn them up to pray


and in its time the spell was snapt
and i could move my een
i lookd farforth but little saw
of what might else be seen


like one that on a lonely road
doth walk in fear and dread
and having once turnd round walks on
and turns no more his head
because he knows a frightful fiend
doth close behind him tread


but soon there breathd a wind on me
ne sound ne motion made
its path was not upon the sea
in ripple or in shade


it raisd my hair it fannd my cheek
like a meadowgale of spring
it mingled strangely with my fears
yet it felt like a welcoming


swiftly swiftly flew the ship
yet she saild softly too
sweetly sweetly blew the breeze
on me alone it blew


o dream of joy is this indeed
the lighthouse top i see
is this the hill is this the kirk
is this mine own countree


we drifted oer the harbourbar
and i with sobs did pray
o let me be awake my god
or let me sleep alway


the harbourbay was clear as glass
so smoothly it was strewn
and on the bay the moon light lay
and the shadow of the moon


the moonlight bay was white all oer
till rising from the same
full many shapes that shadows were
like as of torches came


a little distance from the prow
those darkred shadows were
but soon i saw that my own flesh
was red as in a glare


i turnd my head in fear and dread
and by the holy rood
the bodies had advancd and now
before the mast they stood


they lifted up their stiff right arms
they held them strait and tight
and each rightarm burnt like a torch
a torch thats borne upright
their stony eyeballs glitterd on
in the red and smoky light


i prayd and turnd my head away
forth looking as before
there was no breeze upon the bay
no wave against the shore


the rock shone bright the kirk no less
that stands above the rock
the moonlight steepd in silentness
the steady weathercock


and the bay was white with silent light
till rising from the same
full many shapes that shadows were
in crimson colours came


a little distance from the prow
those crimson shadows were
i turnd my eyes upon the deck
o christ what saw i there


each corse lay flat lifeless and flat
and by the holy rood
a man all light a seraphman
on every corse there stood


this seraphband each wavd his hand
it was a heavenly sight
they stood as signals to the land
each one a lovely light


this seraphband each wavd his hand
no voice did they impart
no voice but o the silence sank
like music on my heart


eftsones i heard the dash of oars
i heard the pilots cheer
my head was turnd perforce away
and i saw a boat appear


then vanishd all the lovely lights
the bodies rose anew
with silent pace each to his place
came back the ghastly crew
the wind that shade nor motion made
on me alone it blew


the pilot and the pilots boy
i heard them coming fast
dear lord in heaven it was a joy
the dead men could not blast


i saw a thirdi heard his voice
it is the hermit good
he singeth loud his godly hymns
that he makes in the wood
hell shrieve my soul hell wash away
the albatrosss blood


this hermit good lives in that wood
which slopes down to the sea
how loudly his sweet voice he rears
he loves to talk with marineres
that come from a far contree


he kneels at morn and noon and eve
he hath a cushion plump
it is the moss that wholly hides
the rotted old oakstump


the skiffboat nerd i heard them talk
why this is strange i trow
where are those lights so many and fair
that signal made but now


strange by my faith the hermit said
and they answerd not our cheer
the planks look warpd and see those sails
how thin they are and sere
i never saw aught like to them
unless perchance it were


the skeletons of leaves that lag
my forest brook along
when the ivytod is heavy with snow
and the owlet whoops to the wolf below
that eats the shewolfs young


dear lord it has a fiendish look
the pilot made reply
i am afeardpush on push on
said the hermit cheerily


the boat came closer to the ship
but i ne spake ne stirrd
the boat came close beneath the ship
and strait a sound was heard


under the water it rumbled on
still louder and more dread
it reachd the ship it split the bay
the ship went down like lead


stunnd by that loud and dreadful sound
which sky and ocean smote
like one that hath been seven days drownd
my body lay afloat
but swift as dreams myself i found
within the pilots boat


upon the whirl where sank the ship
the boat spun round and round
and all was still save that the hill
was telling of the sound


i movd my lips the pilot shriekd
and fell down in a fit
the holy hermit raisd his eyes
and prayd where he did sit


i took the oars the pilots boy
who now doth crazy go
laughd loud and long and all the while
his eyes went to and fro
ha ha quoth hefull plain i see
the devil knows how to row


and now all in mine own countree
i stood on the firm land
the hermit steppd forth from the boat
and scarcely he could stand


o shrieve me shrieve me holy man
the hermit crossd his brow
say quick quoth he i bid thee say
what manner man art thou


forthwith this frame of mine was wrenchd
with a woeful agony
which forcd me to begin my tale
and then it left me free


since then at an uncertain hour
now oftimes and now fewer
that anguish comes and makes me tell
my ghastly aventure


i pass like night from land to land
i have strange power of speech
the moment that his face i see
i know the man that must hear me
to him my tale i teach


what loud uproar bursts from that door
the weddingguests are there
but in the gardenbower the bride
and bridemaids singing are
and hark the little vesperbell
which biddeth me to prayer


o weddingguest this soul hath been
alone on a wide wide sea
so lonely twas that god himself
scarce seemed there to be


o sweeter than the marriagefeast
tis sweeter far to me
to walk together to the kirk
with a goodly company


to walk together to the kirk
and all together pray
while each to his great father bends
old men and babes and loving friends
and youths and maidens gay


farewell farewell but this i tell
to thee thou weddingguest
he prayeth well who loveth well
both man and bird and beast


he prayeth best who loveth best
all things both great and small
for the dear god who loveth us
he made and loveth all


the marinere whose eye is bright
whose beard with age is hoar
is gone and now the weddingguest
turnd from the bridegrooms door


he went like one that hath been stunnd
and is of sense forlorn
a sadder and a wiser man
he rose the morrow morn


in xanadu did kubla khan
a stately pleasuredome decree
where alph the sacred river ran
through caverns measureless to man
down to a sunless sea


so twice five miles of fertile ground
with walls and towers were girdled round
and there were gardens bright with sinuous rills
where blossomed many an incensebearing tree
and here were forests ancient as the hills
enfolding sunny spots of greenery


but oh that deep romantic chasm which slanted
down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover
a savage place as holy and enchanted
as eer beneath a waning moon was haunted
by woman wailing for her demonlover


and from this chasm with ceaseless turmoil seething
as if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing
a mighty fountain momently was forced
amid whose swift halfintermitted burst
huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail
or chaffy grain beneath the threshers flail
and mid these dancing rocks at once and ever
it flung up momently the sacred river


five miles meandering with a mazy motion
through wood and dale the sacred river ran
then reached the caverns measureless to man
and sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean
and mid this tumult kubla heard from far
ancestral voices prophesying war


the shadow of the dome of pleasure
floated midway on the waves
where was heard the mingled measure
from the fountain and the caves
it was a miracle of rare device
a sunny pleasuredome with caves of ice


a damsel with a dulcimer
in a vision once i saw
it was an abyssinian maid
and on her dulcimer she played
singing of mount abora


could i revive within me
her symphony and song
to such a deep delight twould win me
that with music loud and long
i would build that done in air
that sunny dome those caves of ice
and all who heard should see them there
and all should cry beware beware
his flashing eyes his floating hair
weave a circle round him thrice
and close your eyes with holy dread
for he on honeydew hath fed
and drunk the milk of paradise


eternal twins that conquer death and time
perpetual advocates in heaven and earth
fair chaste immaculate and all divine
glorious alone before the first mans birth
your twofold charities celestial lights
bow your sunrising eyes planets of joy
upon these orphan poems in whose rights
conceit first claimed his birthright to enjoy
if pitiful you shun the song of death
or fear the stain of loves lifedropping blood
o know then you are pure and purer faith
shall still keep white the flower the fruit and bud
love moveth all things you that love shall move
all things in him and he in you shall love


grace full of grace though in these verses here
my love complains of others than of thee
yet thee alone i loved and they by me
thou yet unknown only mistaken were
like him which feels a heat now here now there
blames now this cause now that until he see
the fire indeed from whence they caused be
which fire i now do know is you my dear
thus diverse loves dispersed in my verse
in thee alone for ever i unite
and fully unto thee more to rehearse
to him i fly for grace that rules above
that by my grace i may live in delight
or by his grace i never more may love


severed from sweet content my lives sole light
banished by overweening wit from my desire
this poor acceptance only i require
that though my fault have forced me from thy sight
yet that thou wouldst my sorrows to requite
review these sonnets pictures of thy praise
wherein each woe thy wondrous worth doth raise
though first thy worth bereft me of delight
see them forsaken for i them forsook
forsaken first of thee next of my sense
and when thou deignst on their black tears to look
shed not one tear my tears to recompence
but joy in this though fate gainst me repine
my verse still lives to witness thee divine


resolved to love unworthy to obtain
i do no favour crave but humble wise
to thee my sighs in verse i sacrifice
only some pity and no help to gain
hear then and as my heart shall aye remain
a patient object to thy lightning eyes
a patient ear bring thou to thundring cries
fear not the crack when i the blow sustain
so as thine eye bred mine ambitious thought
so shall thine ear make proud my voice for joy
lo dear what wonders great by thee are wrought
when i but little favour do enjoy
the voice is made the ear for to rejoice
and your ear giveth pleasure to my voice


blame not my heart for flying up so high
sith thou art cause that it this flight begun
for earthly vapours drawn up by the sun
comets become and night suns in the sky
mine humble heart so with thy heavenly eye
drawn up aloft all low desires doth shun
raise thou me up as thou my heart hast done
so during night in heaven remain may i
i say again blame not my high desire
sith of us both the cause thereof depends
in thee doth shine in me doth burn a fire
fire draws up other and itself ascends
thine eye a fire and so draws up my love
my love a fire and so ascends above


fly low dear love thy sun dost thou not see
take heed do not so near his rays aspire
lest for thy pride inflamed with wreakful ire
it burn thy wings as it hath burned me
thou haply sayst thy wings immortal be
and so cannot consumed be with fire
and one is hope the other is desire
and that the heavens bestowed them both on thee
a muses words made thee with hope to fly
an angels face desire hath begot
thyself engendered by a goddess eye
yet for all this immortal thou art not
of heavenly eye though thou begotten art
yet art thou born but of a mortal heart


a friend of mine pitying my hopeless love
hoping by killing hope my love to stay
let not quoth he thy hope thy heart betray
impossible it is her heart to move
but sith resolved love cannot remove
as long as thy divine perfections stay
thy godhead then he sought to take away
dear seek revenge and him a liar prove
gods only do impossibilities
impossible saith he thy grace to gain
show then the power of divinities
by granting me thy favour to obtain
so shall thy foe give to himself the lie
a goddess thou shall prove and happy i


thine eye the glass where i behold my heart
mine eye the window through the which thine eye
may see my heart and there thyself espy
in bloody colours how thou painted art
thine eye the pile is of a murdering dart
mine eye the sight thou takst thy level by
to hit my heart and never shootst awry
mine eye thus helps thine eye to work my smart
thine eye a fire is both in heat and light
mine eye of tears a river doth become
o that the water of mine eye had might
to quench the flames that from thine eye doth come
or that the fires kindled by thine eye
the flowing streams of mine eyes could make dry


mine eye with all the deadly sins is fraught
first _proud_ sith it presumed to look so high
a watchman being made stood gazing by
and _idle_ took no heed till i was caught
and _envious_ bears envy that by thought
should in his absence be to her so nigh
to kill my heart mine eye let in her eye
and so consent gave to a _murder_ wrought
and _covetous_ it never would remove
from her fair hair gold so doth please his sight
_unchaste_ a baud between my heart and love
a _glutton_ eye with tears drunk every night
these sins procured have a goddess ire
wherefore my heart is damned in loves sweet fire


falsely doth envy of your praises blame
my tongue my pen my heart of flattery
because i said there was no sun but thee
it called my tongue the partial trump of fame
and saith my pen hath flattered thy name
because my pen did to my tongue agree
and that my heart must needs a flatterer be
which taught both tongue and pen to say the same
no no i flatter not when thee i call
the sun sith that the sun was never such
but when the sun thee i compared withal
doubtless the sun i flattered too much
witness mine eyes i say the truth in this
they have seen thee and know that so it is


much sorrow in itself my love doth move
more my despair to love a hopeless bliss
my folly most to love whom sure to miss
o help me but this last grief to remove
all pains if you command it joy shall prove
and wisdom to seek joy then say but this
because my pleasure in thy torment is
i do command thee without hope to love
so when this thought my sorrow shall augment
that my own folly did procure my pain
then shall i say to give myself content
obedience only made me love in vain
it was your will and not my want of wit
i have the pain bear you the blame of it


my ladys presence makes the roses red
because to see her lips they blush with shame
the lilys leaves for envy pale became
and her white hands in them this envy bred
the marigold the leaves abroad doth spread
because the suns and her power is the same
the violet of purple colour came
dyed in the blood she made my heart to shed
in brief all flowers from her their virtue take
from her sweet breath their sweet smells do proceed
the living heat which her eyebeams doth make
warmeth the ground and quickeneth the seed
the rain wherewith she watereth the flowers
falls from mine eyes which she dissolves in showers


heralds at arms do three perfections quote
to wit most fair most rich most glittering
so when those three concur within one thing
needs must that thing of honour be a note
lately i did behold a rich fair coat
which wished fortune to mine eyes did bring
a lordly coat yet worthy of a king
in which one might all these perfections note
a field of lilies roses proper bare
two stars in chief the crest was waves of gold
how glittering twas might by the stars appear
the lilies made it fair for to behold
and rich it was as by the gold appeareth
but happy he that in his arms it weareth


if true love might true loves reward obtain
dumb wonder only might speak of my joy
but too much worth hath made thee too much coy
and told me long ago i sighed in vain
not then vain hope of undeserved gain
hath made me paint in verses mine annoy
but for thy pleasure that thou mightst enjoy
thy beautys praise in glasses of my pain
see then thyself though me thou wilt not hear
by looking on my verse for pain in verse
love doth in pain beauty in love appear
so if thou wouldst my verses meaning see
expound them thus when i my love rehearse
none loves like he that is none fair like me


it may be love my death doth not pretend
although he shoots at me but thinks it fit
thus to bewitch thee for thy benefit
causing thy will to my wish to condescend
for witches which some murder do intend
do make a picture and do shoot at it
and in that part where they the picture hit
the partys self doth languish to his end
so love too weak by force thy heart to taint
within my heart thy heavenly shape doth paint
suffering therein his arrows to abide
only to thend he might by witches art
within my heart pierce through thy pictures side
and through thy pictures side might wound my heart


the sun his journey ending in the west
taketh his lodging up in thetis bed
though from our eyes his beams be banished
yet with his light th antipodes be blest
now when the suntime brings my sun to rest
which me too oft of rest hath hindered
and whiter skin with white sheet covered
and softer cheek doth on soft pillow rest
then i o sun of suns and light of lights
wish me with those antipodes to be
which see and feel thy beams and heat by nights
well though the night both cold and darksome is
yet half the days delight the night grants me
i feel my suns heat though his light i miss


lady in beauty and in favour rare
of favour not of due i favour crave
nature to thee beauty and favour gave
fair then thou art and favour thou mayst spare
nor when on me bestowed your favours are
less favour in your face you shall not have
if favour then a wounded soul may save
of murders guilt dear lady then beware
my loss of life a million fold were less
than the least loss should unto you befall
yet grant this gift which gift when i possess
both i have life and you no loss at all
for by your favour only i do live
and favour you may well both keep and give


my reason absent did mine eyes require
to watch and ward and such foes to descry
as they should neer my heart approaching spy
but traitor eyes my hearts death did conspire
corrupted with hopes gifts let in desire
to burn my heart and sought no remedy
though store of water were in either eye
which well employed might well have quenched the fire
reason returned love and fortune made
judges to judge mine eyes to punishment
fortune sith they by sight my heart betrayed
from wished sight adjudged them banishment
love sith by fire murdered my heart was found
adjudged them in tears for to be drowned


wonder it is and pity ist that she
in whom all beautys treasure we may find
that may unrich the body and the mind
towards the poor should use no charity
my love has gone a begging unto thee
and if that beauty had not been more kind
that pity long ere this he had been pined
but beauty is content his food to be
o pity have when such poor orphans beg
love naked boy hath nothing on his back
and though he wanteth neither arm nor leg
yet maimed he is sith he his sight doth lack
and yet though blind he beauty can behold
and yet though naked he feels more heat than cold


pity refusing my poor love to feed
a beggar starved for want of help he lies
and at your mouth the door of beauty cries
that thence some alms of sweet grants might proceed
but as he waiteth for some almes deed
a cherry tree before the door he spies
o dear quoth he two cherries may suffice
two only may save life in this my need
but beggars can they nought but cherries eat
pardon my love he is a goddess son
and never feedeth but on dainty meat
else need he not to pine as he hath done
for only the sweet fruit of this sweet tree
can give food to my love and life to me


the fowler hides as closely as he may
the net where caught the silly bird should be
lest he the threatening poison should but see
and so for fear be forced to fly away
my lady so the while she doth assay
in curled knots fast to entangle me
put on her veil to th end i should not flee
the golden net wherein i am a prey
alas most sweet what need is of a net
to catch a bird that is already taen
sith with your hand alone you may it get
for it desires to fly into the same
what needs such art my thoughts then to entrap
when of themselves they fly into your lap


sweet hand the sweet but cruel bow thou art
from whence at me five ivory arrows fly
so with five wounds at once i wounded lie
bearing my breast the print of every dart
saint francis had the like yet felt no smart
where i in living torments never die
his wounds were in his hands and feet where i
all these five helpless wounds feel in my heart
now as saint francis if a saint am i
the bow that shot these shafts a relic is
i mean the hand which is the reason why
so many for devotion thee would kiss
and some thy glove kiss as a thing divine
this arrows quiver and this relics shrine


fair sun if you would have me praise your light
when night approacheth wherefore do you fly
time is so short beauties so many be
as i have need to see them day and night
that by continual view my verses might
tell all the beams of your divinity
which praise to you and joy should be to me
you living by my verse i by your sight
i by your sight and not you by my verse
need mortal skill immortal praise rehearse
no no though eyes were blind and verse were dumb
your beauty should be seen and your fame known
for by the wind which from my sighs do come
your praises round about the world are blown


uncivil sickness hast thou no regard
but dost presume my dearest to molest
and without leave darst enter in that breast
whereto sweet love approach yet never dared
spare thou her health which my life hath not spared
too bitter such revenge of my unrest
although with wrongs my thought she hath opprest
my wrongs seek not revenge they crave reward
cease sickness cease in her then to remain
and come and welcome harbour thou in me
whom love long since hath taught to suffer in
so she which hath so oft my pain increased
o god that i might so revenged be
by my poor pain might have her pain released


woe to mine eyes the organs of mine ill
hate to my heart for not concealing joy
a double curse upon my tongue be still
whose babbling lost what else i might enjoy
when first mine eyes did with thy beauty joy
they to my heart thy wondrous virtues told
who fearing lest thy beams should him destroy
whateer he knew did to my tongue unfold
my telltale tongue in talking over bold
what they in private council did declare
to thee in plain and public terms unrolled
and so by that made thee more coyer far
what in thy praise he spoke that didst thou trust
and yet my sorrows thou dost hold unjust


of an athenian young man have i read
who on blind fortunes picture doated so
that when he could not buy it to his bed
on it he gazing died for very woe
my fortunes picture art thou flinty dame
that settest golden apples to my sight
but wilt by no means let me taste the same
to drown in sight of land is double spite
of fortune as thou learndst to be unkind
so learn to be unconstant to disdain
the wittiest women are to sport inclined
honour is pride and pride is nought but pain
let others boast of choosing for the best
tis substances not names must make us blest


needs must i leave and yet needs must i love
in vain my wit doth tell in verse my woe
despair in me disdain in thee doth show
how by my wit i do my folly prove
all this my heart from love can never move
love is not in my heart no lady no
my heart is love itself till i forego
my heart i never can my love remove
how can i then leave love i do intend
not to crave grace but yet to wish it still
not to praise thee but beauty to commend
and so by beautys praise praise thee i will
for as my heart is love love not in me
so beauty thou beauty is not in thee


sweet sovereign since so many minds remain
obedient subjects at thy beautys call
so many hearts bound in thy hairs as thrall
so many eyes die with one looks disdain
go seek the honour that doth thee pertain
that the fifth monarchy may thee befall
thou hast such means to conquer men withal
as all the world must yield or else be slain
to fight thou needst no weapons but thine eyes
thine hair hath gold enough to pay thy men
and for their food thy beauty will suffice
for men and armour lady care have none
for one will sooner yield unto thee then
when he shall meet thee naked all alone


when your perfections to my thoughts appear
they say among themselves o happy we
whichever shall so rare an object see
but happy heart if thoughts less happy were
for their delights have cost my heart full dear
in whom of love a thousand causes be
and each cause breeds a thousand loves in me
and each love more than thousand hearts can bear
how can my heart so many loves then hold
which yet by heaps increase from day to day
but like a ship thats oercharged with gold
must either sink or hurl the gold away
but hurl not love thou canst not feeble heart
in thine own blood thou therefore drowned art


fools be they that inveigh gainst mahomet
whos but a moral of loves monarchy
but a dull adamant as straw by jet
he in an iron chest was drawn on high
in midst of meccas temple roof some say
he now hangs without touch or stay at all
that mahomet is she to whom i pray
may neer man pray so ineffectual
mine eyes loves strange exhaling adamants
unwares to my hearts temples height have wrought
the iron idol that compassion wants
who my oft tears and travails sets at nought
iron hath been transformed to gold by art
her face limbs flesh and all gold save her heart


ready to seek out death in my disgrace
my mistress gan to smooth her gathered brows
whereby i am reprieved for a space
o hope and fear who half your torments knows
it is some mercy in a blackmouthed judge
to haste his prisoners end if he must die
dear if all other favour you shall grudge
do speedy execution with your eye
with one sole look you leave in me no soul
count it a loss to lose a faithful slave
would god that i might hear my last bell toll
so in your bosom i might dig a grave
doubtful delay is worse than any fever
or help me soon or cast me off for ever


each day new proofs of new despair i find
that is new deaths no marvel then though i
make exile my last help to thend mine eye
should not behold the death to me assigned
not that from death absence might save my mind
but that it might take death more patiently
like him the which by judge condemned to die
to suffer with more ease his eyes doth blind
your lips in scarlet clad my judges be
pronouncing sentence of eternal no
despair the hangman that tormenteth me
the death i suffer is the life i have
for only life doth make me die in woe
and only death i for my pardon crave


the richest relic rome did ever view
was caesars tomb on which with cunning hand
joves triple honours the three fair graces stand
telling his virtues in their virtues true
this rome admired but dearest dear in you
dwelleth the wonder of the happiest land
and all the world to neptunes furthest strand
for what rome shaped hath living life in you
thy naked beauty bounteously displayed
enricheth monarchies of hearts with love
thine eyes to hear complaints are open laid
thine eyes kind looks requite all pains i prove
that of my death i dare not thee accuse
but pride in me that baser chance refuse


why thus unjustly say my cruel fate
dost thou adjudge my luckless eyes and heart
the one to live exiled from that sweet smart
where th other pines imprisoned without date
my luckless eyes must never more debate
of those bright beams that eased my love apart
and yet my heart bound to them with loves dart
must there dwell ever to bemoan my state
o had mine eyes been suffered there to rest
often they had my hearts unquiet eased
or had my heart with banishment been blest
mine eye with beauty never had been pleased
but since these cross effects hath fortune wrought
dwell heart with her eyes view her in my thought


hope like the hyaena coming to be old
alters his shape is turned into despair
pity my hoary hopes maid of clear mould
think not that frowns can ever make thee fair
what harm is it to kiss to laugh to play
beautys no blossom if it be not used
sweet dalliance keeps the wrinkles long away
repentance follows them that have refused
to bring you to the knowledge of your good
i seek i sue o try and then believe
each image can be chaste thats carved of wood
you show you live when men you do relieve
iron with wearing shines rust wasteth treasure
on earth but love there is no other pleasure


ay me poor wretch my prayer is turned to sin
i say i love my mistress says tis lust
thus most we lose where most we seek to win
wit will make wicked what is neer so just
and yet i can supplant her false surmise
lust is a fire that for an hour or twain
giveth a scorching blaze and then he dies
love a continual furnace doth maintain
a furnace well this a furnace may be called
for it burns inward yields a smothering flame
sighs which like boiled leads smoking vapour scald
i sigh apace at echo of sighs name
long have i served no short blaze is my love
hid joys there are that maids scorn till they prove


i do not now complain of my disgrace
o cruel fair one fair with cruel crost
nor of the hour season time nor place
nor of my foil for any freedom lost
nor of my courage by misfortune daunted
nor of my wit by overweening struck
nor of my sense by any sound enchanted
nor of the force of fierypointed hook
nor of the steel that sticks within my wound
nor of my thoughts by worser thoughts defaced
nor of the life i labour to confound
but i complain that being thus disgraced
fired feared frantic fettered shot through slain
my death is such as i may not complain


if ever sorrow spoke from soul that loves
as speaks a spirit in a man possest
in me her spirit speaks my soul it moves
whose sighswolln words breed whirlwinds in my breast
or like the echo of a passing bell
which sounding on the water seems to howl
so rings my heart a fearful heavy knell
and keeps all night in consort with the owl
my cheeks with a thin ice of tears are clad
mine eyes like morning stars are bleared and red
what resteth then but i be raging mad
to see that she my cares chief conduithead
when all streams else help quench my burning heart
shuts up her springs and will no grace impart


you secret vales you solitary fields
you shores forsaken and you sounding rocks
if ever groaning heart hath made you yield
or words half spoke that sense in prison locks
then mongst night shadows whisper out my death
that when myself hath sealed my lips from speaking
each telltale echo with a weeping breath
may both record my truth and true loves breaking
you pretty flowers that smile for summers sake
pull in your heads before my watry eyes
do turn the meadows to a standing lake
by whose untimely floods your glory dies
for lo mine heart resolved to moistening air
feedeth mine eyes which double tear for tear


his shadow to narcissus well presented
how fair he was by such attractive love
so if thou wouldst thyself thy beauty prove
vulgar breathmirrors might have well contented
and to their prayers eternally consented
oaths vows and sighs if they believe might move
but more thou forcst making my pen approve
thy praise to all least any had dissented
when this hath wrought thou which before wert known
but unto some of all art now required
and thine eyes wonders wronged because not shown
the world with daily orisons desired
thy chaste fair gifts with learnings breath is blown
and thus my pen hath made thy sweets admired


i am no model figure or sign of care
but his eternal heartsconsuming essence
in whom griefs commentaries written are
drawing gross passion into pure quintessence
not thine eyes fire but fire of thine eyes disdain
fed by neglect of my continual grieving
attracts the true lifes spirit of my pain
and gives it thee which gives me no relieving
within thine arms sad elegies i sing
unto thine eyes a true heart lovetorn lay i
thou smellst from me the savours sorrows bring
my tears to taste my truth to touch display i
lo thus each sense dear fair one i importune
but being care thou flyest me as ill fortune


but being care thou flyest me as ill fortune
care the consuming canker of the mind
the discord that disorders sweet hearts tune
th abortive bastard of a coward mind
the lightfoot lackey that runs post by death
bearing the letters which contain our end
the busy advocate that sells his breath
denouncing worst to him is most his friend
o dear this care no interest holds in me
but holy care the guardian of thy fair
thine honours champion and thy virtues fee
the zeal which thee from barbarous times shall bear
this care am i this care my life hath taken
dear to my soul then leave me not forsaken


dear to my soul then leave me not forsaken
fly not my heart within thy bosom sleepeth
even from myself and sense i have betaken
me unto thee for whom my spirit weepeth
and on the shore of that salt teary sea
couched in a bed of unseen seeming pleasure
where in imaginary thoughts thy fair self lay
but being waked robbed of my lifes best treasure
i call the heavens air earth and seas to hear
my love my truth and black disdained estate
beating the rocks with bellowings of despair
which still with plaints my words reverberate
sighing alas what shall become of me
whilst echo cries what shall become of me


prometheus for stealing living fire
from heavens king was judged eternal death
in selfsame flame with unrelenting ire
bound fast to caucasus low foot beneath
so i for stealing living beautys fire
into my verse that it may always live
and change his forms to shapes of my desire
thou beautys queen self sentence like dost give
bound to thy feet in chains of life i lie
for to thine eyes i never dare aspire
and in thy beautys brightness do i fry
as poor prometheus in the scalding fire
which tears maintain as oil the lamp revives
only my succour in thy favour lies


one sun unto my lifes day gives true light
one moon dissolves my stormy night of woes
one star my fate and happy fortune shows
one saint i serve one shrine with vows i dight
one sun transfixd hath burnt my heart outright
one moon opposed my love in darkness throws
one star hath bid my thoughts my wrongs disclose
saints scorn poor swains shrines do my vows no right
yet if my love be found a holy fire
pure unstained without idolatry
and she nathless in hate of my desire
lives to repose her in my misery
my sun my moon my star my saint my shrine
mine be the torment but the guilt be thine


to live in hell and heaven to behold
to welcome life and die a living death
to sweat with heat and yet be freezing cold
to grasp at stars and lie the earth beneath
to treat a maze that never shall have end
to burn in sighs and starve in daily tears
to climb a hill and never to descend
giants to kill and quake at childish fears
to pine for food and watch th hesperian tree
to thirst for drink and nectar still to draw
to live accursd whom men hold blest to be
and weep those wrongs which never creature saw
if this be love if love in these be founded
my heart is love for these in it are grounded


a carver having loved too long in vain
hewed out the portraiture of venus son
in marble rock upon the which did rain
small drizzling drops that from a fount did run
imagining the drops would either wear
his fury out or quench his living flame
but when he saw it bootless did appear
he swore the water did augment the same
so i that seek in verse to carve thee out
hoping thy beauty will my flame allay
viewing my verse and poems all throughout
find my will rather to my love obey
that with the carver i my work do blame
finding it still th augmenter of my flame


astronomers the heavens do divide
into eight houses where the god remains
all which in thy perfections do abide
for in thy feet the queen of silence reigns
about thy waist joves messenger doth dwell
inchanting me as i thereat admire
and on thy dugs the queen of love doth tell
her godheads power in scrolls of my desire
thy beauty is the worlds eternal sun
thy favours force a cowards heart to dare
and in thy hairs jove and his riches won
thy frowns hold saturn thines the fixed stars
pardon me then divine to love thee well
since thou art heaven and i in heaven would dwell


weary of love my thoughts of love complained
till reason told them there was no such power
and bade me view fair beautys richest flower
to see if there a naked boy remained
dear to thine eyes eyes that my soul hath pained
thoughts turned them back in that unhappy hour
to see if love kept there his royal bower
for if not there then no place him contained
there was he not nor boy nor golden bow
yet as thou turned thy chaste fair eye aside
a flame of fire did from thine eyelids go
which burnt my heart through my sore wounded side
then with a sigh reason made thoughts to cry
there is no god of love save that thine eye


forgive me dear for thundering on thy name
sure tis thyself that shows my love distrest
for fire exhaled in freezing clouds possessed
warring for way makes all the heavens exclaim
thy beauty so the brightest living flame
wrapt in my cloudy heart by winter prest
scorning to dwell within so base a nest
thunders in me thy everlasting flame
o that my heart might still contain that fire
or that the fire would always light my heart
then shouldst thou not disdain my true desire
or think i wronged thee to reveal to my smart
for as the fire through freezing clouds doth break
so not myself but thou in me wouldst speak


my heart mine eye accuseth of his death
saying his wanton sight bred his unrest
mine eye affirms my hearts unconstant faith
hath been his bane and all his joys repressed
my heart avows mine eye let in the fire
which burns him with an everliving light
mine eye replies my greedy hearts desire
let in those floods which drown him day and night
thus wars my heart which reason doth maintain
and calls my eye to combat if he dare
the whilst my soul impatient of disdain
wrings from his bondage unto death more near
save that my love still holdeth him in hand
a kingdom thus divided cannot stand


unhappy day unhappy month and season
when first proud love my joys away adjourning
poured into mine eye to her eye turning
a deadly juice unto my green thoughts reason
prisoner i am unto the eye i gaze on
eternally my loves flame is in burning
a mortal shaft still wounds me in my mourning
thus prisoned burnt and slain the spirit soul and reason
what tides me then since these pains which annoy me
in my despair are evermore increasing
the more i love less is my pains releasing
that cursed be the fortune which destroys me
the hour the month the season and the cause
when love first made me thrall to lovers laws


love hath i followed all too long nought gaining
and sighed i have in vain to sweet what smarteth
but from his brow a fiery arrow parteth
thinking that i should him resist not plaining
but cowardly my heart submiss remaining
yields to receive what shaft thy fair eye darteth
well do i see thine eye my bale imparteth
and that save death no hope i am detaining
for what is he can alter fortunes sliding
one in his bed consumes his life away
other in wars another in the sea
the like effects in me have their abiding
for heavens avowed my fortune should be such
that i should die by loving far too much


my god my god how much i love my goddess
whose virtues rare unto the heavens arise
my god my god how much i love her eyes
one shining bright the other full of hardness
my god my god how much i love her wisdom
whose works may ravish heavens richest maker
of whose eyes joys if i might be partaker
then to my soul a holy rest would come
my god how much i love to hear her speak
whose hands i kiss and ravished oft rekisseth
when she stands wotless whom so much she blesseth
say then what mind this honest love would break
since her perfections pure withouten blot
makes her beloved of thee she knoweth not


the first created held a joyous bower
a flowering field the worlds sole wonderment
high paradise from whence a womans power
enticed him to fall to endless banishment
this on the banks of euphrates did stand
till the first mover by his wondrous might
planted it in thine eyes thy face thy hands
from whence the world receives his fairest light
thy cheeks contain choice flowers thy eyes two suns
thy hands the fruit that no life blood can stain
and in thy breath that heavenly music wons
which when thou speakst angels their voices strain
as from the first thy sex exiled me
so to this next let me be called by thee


fair grace of graces muse of muses all
thou paradise thou only heaven i know
what influence hath bred my hateful woe
that i from thee and them am forced to fall
thou falled from me from thee i never shall
although my fortunes thou hast brought so low
yet shall my faith and service with thee go
for live i do on heaven and thee to call
banishd all grace no graces with me dwell
compelled to muse my muses from me fly
excluded heaven what can remain but hell
exiled from paradise in hate i lie
cursing my stars albeit i find it true
i lost all these when i lost love and you


what viewed i dear when i thine eyes beheld
love in his glory no him thyrsis saw
and stood the boy whilst he his darts did draw
whose painted pride to baser swains he telled
saw i two suns that sight is seen but seld
yet can their brood that teach the holy law
gaze on their beams and dread them not a straw
where princely looks are by their eyes repelled
what saw i then doubtless it was amen
armed with strong thunder and a lightnings flame
who bridegroom like with power was riding then
meaning that none should see him when he came
yet did i gaze and thereby caught the wound
which burns my heart and keeps my body sound


when tedious much and over weary long
cruel disdain reflecting from her brow
hath been the cause that i endured such wrong
and rest thus discontent and weary now
yet when posterity in time to come
shall find th uncancelled tenour of her vow
and her disdain be then confessed of some
how much unkind and long i find it now
o yet even thenthough then will be too late
to comfort me dead many a day ere then
they shall confess i did not force her heart
and time shall make it known to other men
that neer had her disdain made me despair
had she not been so excellently fair


had she not been so excellently fair
my muse had never mourned in lines of woe
but i did too inestimable weigh her
and thats the cause i now lament me so
yet not for her contempt do i complain me
complaints may ease the mind but that is all
therefore though she too constantly disdain me
i can but sigh and grieve and so i shall
yet grieve i not because i must grieve ever
and yet alas waste tears away in vain
i am resolved truly to persever
though she persisteth in her old disdain
but that which grieves me most is that i see
those which most fair the most unkindest be


thus long imposed to everlasting plaining
divinely constant to the worthiest fair
and moved by eternally disdaining
aye to persever in unkind despair
because now silence wearily confined
in tedious dying and a dumb restraint
breaks forth in tears from mine unable mind
to ease her passion by a poor complaint
o do not therefore to thyself suggest
that i can grieve to have immured so long
upon the matter of mine own unrest
such grief is not the tenour of my song
that bide so zealously so bad a wrong
my grief is this unless i speak and plain me
thou wilt persever ever to disdain me


thou wilt persever ever to disdain me
and i shall then die when thou will repent it
o do not therefore from complaint restrain me
and take my life from me to me that lent it
for whilst these accents weepingly exprest
in humble lines of reverentest zeal
have issue to complaint from mine unrest
they but thy beautys wonder shall reveal
and though the grieved muse of some other lover
whose less devotions knew but woes like mine
would rather seek occasion to discover
how little pitiful and how much unkind
they other not so worthy beauties find
o i not so but seek with humble prayer
means how to move th unmercifullest fair


as draws the golden meteor of the day
exhaled matter from the ground to heaven
and by his secret nature there to stay
the thing fast held and yet of hold bereaven
so by th attractive excellence and might
born to the power of thy transparent eyes
drawn from myself ravished with thy delight
whose dumb conceits divinely sirenise
lo in suspense of fear and hope upholden
diversely poised with passions that pain me
no resolution dares my thoughts embolden
since tis not i but thou that dost sustain me
o if theres none but thou can work my woe
wilt thou be still unkind and kill me so


wilt thou be still unkind and kill me so
whose humbled vows with sorrowful appeal
do still persist and did so long ago
intreat for pity with so pure a zeal
suffice the world shall for the world can say
how much thy power hath power and what it can
never was victorhand yet moved to slay
the rendered captive or the yielding man
then o why should thy womanthought impose
death and disdain on him that yields his breath
to free his soul from discontent and woes
and humble sacrifice to a certain death
o since the world knows what the power can do
what weret for thee to save and love me too


i meet not mine by others discontent
for none compares with me in true devotion
yet though my tears and sighs to her be spent
her cruel heart disdains what they do motion
yet though persisting in eternal hate
to aggravate the cause of my complaining
her fury neer confineth with a date
i will not cease to love for her disdaining
such puny thoughts of unresolved ground
whose inaudacity dares but base conceit
in me and my love never shall be found
those coward thoughts unworthy minds await
but those that love well have not yet begun
persever ever and have never done


persever ever and have never done
you weeping accent of my weary song
o do not you eternal passions shun
but be you true and everlasting long
say that she doth requite you with disdain
yet fortified with hope endure your fortune
though cruel now she will be kind again
such haps as those such loves as yours importune
though she protests the faithfullest severity
inexecrable beauty is inflicting
kindness in time will pity your sincerity
though now it be your fortunes interdicting
for some can say whose loves have known like passion
women are kind by kind and coy for fashion


give period to my matter of complaining
fair wonder of our times admiring eye
and entertain no more thy long disdaining
or give me leave at last that i may die
for who can live perpetually secluded
from death to life that loathes her discontent
lest by some hope seducively deluded
such thoughts aspire to fortunate event
but i that now have drawn malpleasant breath
under the burden of thy cruel hate
o i must long and linger after death
and yet i dare not give my life her date
for if i die and thou repent t have slain me
twill grieve me more than if thou didst disdain me


twill grieve me more than if thou didst disdain me
that i should die and thou because i die so
and yet to die it should not know to pain me
if cruel beauty were content to bid so
death to my life life to my long despair
prolonged by her given to my love and days
are means to tell how truly she is fair
and i can die to testify her praise
yet not to die though fairness me despiseth
is cause why in complaint i thus persever
though death me and my love inparadiseth
by interdicting me from her for ever
i do not grieve that i am forced to die
but die to think upon the reason why


my tears are true though others be divine
and sing of wars and troys new rising frame
meeting heroic feet in every line
that tread high measures in the scene of fame
and i though disaccustoming my muse
and sing but low songs in an humble vein
may one day raise my style as others use
and turn elizon to a higher strain
when reintombing from oblivious ages
in better stanzas her surviving wonder
i may opposed against the monster rage
that part desert and excellence asunder
that she though coy may yet survive to see
her beautys wonder lives again in me


sometimes in verse i praised sometimes in verse sighed
no more shall pen with love and beauty mell
but to my heart alone my heart shall tell
how unseen flames do burn it day and night
lest flames give light light bring my love to sight
and my love prove my folly to excel
wherefore my love burns like the fire of hell
wherein is fire and yet there is no light
for if one never loved like me then why
skillless blames he the thing he doth not know
and he that so hath loved should favour show
for he hath been a fool as well as i
thus shall henceforth more pain more folly have
and folly past may justly pardon crave


fair by inheritance whom born we see
both in the wondrous year and on the day
wherein the fairest planet beareth sway
the heavens to thee this fortune doth decree
thou of a world of hearts in time shall be
a monarch great and with one beautys ray
so many hosts of hearts thy face shall slay
as all the rest for love shall yield to thee
but even as alexander when he knew
his fathers conquests wept lest he should leave
no kingdom unto him for to subdue
so shall thy mother thee of praise bereave
so many hearts already she hath slain
as few behind to conquer shall remain


delight in your bright eyes my death did breed
as light and glittering weapons babes allure
to play with fire and sword and so procure
then to be burnt and hurt ere they take heed
thy beauty so hath made me burn and bleed
yet shall my ashes and my blood assure
thy beautys fame forever to endure
for thy fames life from my death doth proceed
because my heart to ashes burned giveth
life to thy fame thou right a phoenix art
and like a pelican thy beauty liveth
by sucking blood out of my breast and heart
lo why with wonder we may thee compare
unto the pelican and phoenix rare


eyes curious to behold what nature can create
come see come see and write what wonder you do see
causing by true report our next posterity
curse fortune for that they were born too late
come then and come ye all come soon lest that
the time should be too short and men too few should be
for all be few to write her least parts history
though they should ever write and never write but that
millions look on her eyes millions think on her wit
millions speak of her millions write of her hand
the whole eye on the lip i do not understand
millions too few to praise but some one part of it
as either of her eye or lip or hand to write
the light or black the taste or red the soft or white


lady of ladies the delight alone
for which to heaven earth doth no envy bear
seeing and hearing thee we see and hear
such voice such light as never sung nor shone
the want of heaven i grant yet we may moan
not for the pleasure of the angels there
as though in face or voice they like thee were
but that they many be and thou but one
the basest notes which from thy voice proceed
the treble of the angels do exceed
so that i fear their choir to beautify
lest thou to some in heaven shall sing and shine
lo when i hear thee sing the reason why
sighs of my breast keep time with notes of thine


not that thy hand is soft is sweet is white
thy lips sweet roses breast sweet lily is
that love esteems these three the chiefest bliss
which nature ever made for lips delight
but when these three to show their heavenly might
such wonders do devotion then for this
commandeth us with humble zeal to kiss
such things as work miracles in our sight
a lute of senseless wood by nature dumb
touched by thy hand doth speak divinely well
and from thy lips and breast sweet tunes do come
to my dead heart the which new life do give
of greater wonders heard we never tell
than for the dumb to speak the dead to live


when beauty to the world vouchsafes this bliss
to show the one whose other there is not
the whitest skins red blushing shame doth blot
and in the reddest cheeks pale envy is
the fair and foul come thus alike by this
for when the sun hath our horizon got
venus herself doth shine no more god wot
than the least star that takes the light from his
the poor in beauty thus content remain
to see their jealous cause revenged in thee
and their fair foes afflicted with like pain
lo the clear proof of thy divinity
for unto god is only due this praise
the highest to pluck down the low to raise


miracle of the world i never will deny
that former poets praise the beauty of their days
but all those beauties were but figures of thy praise
and all those poets did of thee but prophesy
thy coming to the world hath taught us to descry
what petrarchs laura meant for truth the lip bewrays
lo why th italians yet which never saw thy rays
to find out petrarchs sense such forged glosses try
the beauties which he in a veil enclosed beheld
but revelations were within his surest heart
by which in parables thy coming he foretold
his songs were hymns of thee which only now before
thy image should be sung for thou that goddess art
which only we without idolatry adore


now now i love indeed and suffer more
in one day now then i did in a year
great flames they be which but small sparkles were
and wounded now i was but pricked before
no marvel then though more than heretofore
i weep and sigh how can great wounds be there
where moisture runs not out and ever where
the fire is great of smoke there must be store
my heart was hitherto but like green wood
which must be dried before it will burn bright
my former love served but my heart to dry
now cupid for his fire doth find it good
for now it burneth clear and shall give light
for all the world your beauty to espy


dear though from me your gratious looks depart
and of that comfort do myself bereave
which both i did deserve and did receive
triumph not over much in this my smart
nay rather they which now enjoy thy heart
for fear just cause of mourning should conceive
lest thou inconstant shouldst their trust deceive
which like unto the weather changing art
for in foul weather birds sing often will
in hope of fair and in fair time will cease
for fear fair time should not continue still
so they may mourn which have thy heart possessed
for fear of change and hope of change may ease
their hearts whom grief of change doth now molest


if ever any justly might complain
of unrequited service it is i
change is the thanks i have for loyalty
and only her reward is her disdain
so as just spite did almost me constrain
through torment her due praises to deny
for he which vexed is with injury
by speaking ill doth ease his heart of pain
but what shall torture make me wrong her name
no no a prisner constant thinks it shame
though he were racked his first truth to gainsay
her true given praise my first confession is
though her disdain do rack me night and day
this i confessed and will deny in this


my mothers maids when they did sew and spin
they sang sometime a song of the field mouse
that for because her livelihood was but thin


would needs go seek her townish sisters house
she thought herself endured too much pain
the stormy blasts her cave so sore did souse


that when the furrows swimmed with the rain
she must lie cold and wet in sorry plight
and worse than that bare meat there did remain


to comfort her when she her house had dight
sometime a barly corn sometime a bean
for which she laboured hard both day and night


in harvest time whilst she might go and glean
and where store was stroyed with the flood
then welaway for she undone was clean


then was she fain to take instead of food
sleep if she might her hunger to beguile
my sister quoth she hath a living good


and hence from me she dwelleth not a mile
in cold and storm she lieth warm and dry
in bed of down the dirt doth not defile
her tender foot she laboureth not as i


my lute awake perform the last
labor that thou and i shall waste
and end that i have now begun
and when this song is sung and past
my lute be still for i have done


as to be heard where ear is none
as lead to grave in marble stone
my song may pierce her heart as soon
should we then sing or sigh or moan
no no my lute for i have done


the rock doth not so cruelly
repulse the waves continually
as she my suit and affection
so that i am past remedy
whereby my lute and i have done


proud of the spoil that thou hast got
of simple hearts thorough loves shot
by whom unkind thou hast them won
think not he hath his bow forgot
although my lute and i have done


vengeance shall fall on thy disdain
that makest but game of earnest pain
trow not alone under the sun
unquit to cause thy lovers plain
although my lute and i have done


may chance thee lie withered and old
in winter nights that are so cold
plaining in vain unto the moon
thy wishes then dare not be told
care then who list for i have done


and then may chance thee to repent
the time that thou hast lost and spent
to cause thy lovers sigh and swoon
then shalt thou know beauty but lent
and wish and want as i have done


now cease my lute this is the last
labor that thou and i shall waste
and ended is that we begun
now is thy song both sung and past
my lute be still for i have done


since so ye please to hear me plain
and that ye do rejoice my smart
me list no lenger to remain
to such as be so overthwart


but cursed be that cruel heart
which hath procurd a careless mind
for me and mine unfeigned smart
and forceth me such faults to find


more than too much i am assured
of thine intent whereto to trust
a speedless proof i have endured
and now i leave it to them that lust


and wilt thou leave me thus
say nay say nay for shame
to save thee from the blame
of all my grief and grame
and wilt thou leave me thus
say nay say nay


and wilt thou leave me thus
that hath loved thee so long
in wealth and woe among
and is thy heart so strong
as for to leave me thus
say nay say nay


and wilt thou leave me thus
that hath given thee my heart
never for to depart
neither for pain nor smart
and wilt thou leave me thus
say nay say nay


and wilt thou leave me thus
and have no more pitye
of him that loveth thee
alas thy cruelty
and wilt thou leave me thus
say nay say nay


in court to serve decked with fresh array
of sugared meats feeling the sweet repast
the life in banquets and sundry kinds of play
amid the press of worldly looks to waste
hath with it joined oft times such bitter taste
that whoso joyes such kind of life to hold
in prison joyes fettered with chains of gold


they flee from me that sometime did me seek
with naked foot stalking in my chamber
i have seen them gentle tame and meek
that now are wild and do not remember
that sometime they put themselves in danger
to take bread at my hand and now they range
busily seeking with a continual change


thanked be fortune it hath been otherwise
twenty times better but once in special
in thin array after a pleasant guise
when her loose gown from her shoulders did fall
and she me caught in her arms long and small
and therewith all sweetly did me kiss
and softly said dear heart how like you this


it was no dream i lay broad waking
but all is turned thorough my gentleness
into a strange fashion of forsaking
and i have leave to go of her goodness
and she also to use newfangleness
but since that i so kindely am served
i fain sould know what she hath deserved


wonder of these glory of other times
o thou whom envy evn is forced tadmire
great patroness of these my humble rhymes
which thou from out thy greatness dost inspire
since only thou has deigned to raise them higher
vouchsafe now to accept them as thine own
begotten by thy hand and my desire
wherein my zeal and thy great might is shown
and seeing this unto the world is known
o leave not still to grace thy work in me
let not the quickening seed be overthrown
of that which may be born to honor thee
whereof the travail i may challenge mine
but yet the glory madam must be thine


unto the boundless ocean of thy beauty
runs this poor river charged with streams of zeal
returning thee the tribute of my duty
which here my love my youth my plaints reveal
here i unclasp the book of my charged soul
where i have cast th accounts of all my care
here have i summed my sighs here i enrol
how they were spent for thee look what they are
look on the dear expenses of my youth
and see how just i reckon with thine eyes
examine well thy beauty with my truth
and cross my cares ere greater sums arise
read it sweet maid though it be done but slightly
who can show all his love doth love but lightly


go wailing verse the infants of my love
minervalike brought forth without a mother
present the image of the cares i prove
witness your fathers grief exceeds all other
sigh out a story of her cruel deeds
with interrupted accents of despair
a monument that whosoever reads
may justly praise and blame my loveless fair
say her disdain hath dried up my blood
and starved you in succours still denying
press to her eyes importune me some good
waken her sleeping pity with your crying
knock at her hard heart beg till you have moved her
and tell thunkind how dearly i have loved her


if so it hap this offspring of my care
these fatal anthems lamentable songs
come to their view who like afflicted are
let them yet sigh their own and moan my wrongs
but untouched hearts with unaffected eye
approach not to behold my souls distress
clearsighted you soon note what is awry
whilst blinded souls mine errors never guess
you blinded souls whom youth and error lead
you outcast eaglets dazzled with your sun
do you and none but you my sorrows read
you best can judge the wrongs that she hath done
that she hath done the motive of my pain
who whilst i love doth kill me with disdain


these plaintive verse the posts of my desire
which haste for succour to her slow regard
bear not report of any slender fire
forging a grief to win a fames reward
nor are my passions limned for outward hue
for that no colours can depaint my sorrows
delia herself and all the world may view
best in my face where cares have tilled deep furrows
no bays i seek to deck my mourning brow
o cleareyed rector of the holy hill
my humble accents bear the olive bough
of intercession but to move her will
these lines i use tunburden mine own heart
my love affects no fame nor steems of art


whilst youth and error led my wandering mind
and set my thoughts in heedless ways to range
all unawares a goddess chaste i find
dianalike to work my sudden change
for her no sooner had mine eye bewrayed
but with disdain to see me in that place
with fairest hand the sweet unkindest maid
casts watercold disdain upon my face
which turned my sport into a harts despair
which still is chased while i have any breath
by mine own thoughts set on me by my fair
my thoughts like hounds pursue me to my death
those that i fostered of mine own accord
are made by her to murder thus their lord


fair is my love and cruel as shes fair
her brow shades frowns although her eyes are sunny
her smiles are lightning though her pride despair
and her disdains are gall her favours honey
a modest maid decked with a blush of honour
whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love
the wonder of all eyes that look upon her
sacred on earth designed a saint above
chastity and beauty which were deadly foes
live reconciled friends within her brow
and had she pity to conjoin with those
then who had heard the plaints i utter now
o had she not been fair and thus unkind
my muse had slept and none had known my mind


for had she not been fair and thus unkind
then had no finger pointed at my lightness
the world had never known what i do find
and clouds obscure had shaded still her brightness
then had no censors eye these lines surveyed
nor graver brows have judged my muse so vain
no sun my blush and error had bewrayed
nor yet the world had heard of such disdain
then had i walked with bold erected face
no downcast look had signified my miss
but my degraded hopes with such disgrace
did force me groan out griefs and utter this
for being full should i not then have spoken
my sense oppressed had failed and heart had broken


thou poor heart sacrificed unto the fairest
hast sent the incense of thy sighs to heaven
and still against her frowns fresh vows repairest
and made thy passions with her beauty even
and you mine eyes the agents of my heart
told the dumb message of my hidden grief
and oft with careful tunes with silent art
did treat the cruel fair to yield relief
and you my verse the advocates of love
have followed hard the process of my case
and urged that title which doth plainly prove
my faith should win if justice might have place
yet though i see that nought we do can move
tis not disdain must make me cease to love


if this be love to draw a weary breath
to paint on floods till the shore cry to thair
with downward looks still reading on the earth
these sad memorials of my loves despair
if this be love to war against my soul
lie down to wail rise up to sigh and grieve
the neverresting stone of care to roll
still to complain my griefs whilst none relieve
if this be love to clothe me with dark thoughts
haunting untrodden paths to wail apart
my pleasures horror music tragic notes
tears in mine eyes and sorrow at my heart
if this be love to live a living death
then do i love and draw this weary breath


then do i love and draw this weary breath
for her the cruel fair within whose brow
i written find the sentence of my death
in unkind letters wrote she cares not how
thou power that rulst the confines of the night
laughterloving goddess worldly pleasures queen
intenerate that heart that sets so light
the truest love that ever yet was seen
and cause her leave to triumph in this wise
upon the prostrate spoil of that poor heart
that serves a trophy to her conquering eyes
and must their glory to the world impart
once let her know shhath done enough to prove me
and let her pity if she cannot love me


tears vows and prayers gain the hardest hearts
tears vows and prayers have i spent in vain
tears cannot soften flint nor vows convert
prayers prevail not with a quaint disdain
i lose my tears where i have lost my love
i vow my faith where faith is not regarded
i pray in vain a merciless to move
so rare a faith ought better be rewarded
yet though i cannot win her will with tears
though my souls idol scorneth all my vows
though all my prayers be to so deaf ears
no favour though the cruel fair allows
yet will i weep vow pray to cruel she
flint frost disdain wears melts and yields we see


my spotless love hovers with purest wings
about the temple of the proudest frame
where blaze those lights fairest of earthly things
which clear our clouded world with brightest flame
mambitious thoughts confined in her face
affect no honour but what she can give
my hopes do rest in limits of her grace
i weigh no comfort unless she relieve
for she that can my heart imparadise
holds in her fairest hand what dearest is
my fortunes wheels the circle of her eyes
whose rolling grace deign once a turn of bliss
all my lifes sweet consists in her alone
so much i love the most unloving one


behold what hap pygmalion had to frame
and carve his proper grief upon a stone
my heavy fortune is much like the same
i work on flint and thats the cause i moan
for hapless lo even with mine own desires
i figured on the table of my heart
the fairest form that the worlds eye admires
and so did perish by my proper art
and still i toil to change the marble breast
of her whose sweetest grace i do adore
yet cannot find her breathe unto my rest
hard is her heart and woe is me therefore
o happy he that joyed his stone and art
unhappy i to love a stony heart


those snary locks are those same nets my dear
wherewith my liberty thou didst surprise
love was the flame that fired me so near
the dart transpiercing were those crystal eyes
strong is the net and fervent is the flame
deep is the wound my sighs can well report
yet i do love adore and praise the same
that holds that burns that wounds in this sort
and list not seek to break to quench to heal
the bond the flame the wound that festereth so
by knife by liquor or by salve to deal
so much i please to perish in my woe
yet lest long travails be above my strength
good delia loose quench heal me now at length


if that a loyal heart and faith unfeigned
if a sweet languish with a chaste desire
if hungerstarven thoughts so long retained
fed but with smoke and cherished but with fire
and if a brow with cares characters painted
bewray my love with broken words half spoken
to her which sits in my thoughts temple sainted
and lays to view my vulturegnawn heart open
if i have done due homage to her eyes
and had my sighs still tending on her name
if on her love my life and honour lies
and she thunkindest maid still scorns the same
let this suffice that all the world may see
the fault is hers though mine the hurt must be


happy in sleep waking content to languish
embracing clouds by night in daytime mourn
my joys but shadows touch of truth my anguish
griefs ever springing comforts never born
and still expecting when she will relent
grown hoarse with crying mercy mercy give
so many vows and prayers having spent
that weary of my life i loathe to live
and yet the hydra of my cares renews
still newborn sorrows of her fresh disdain
and still my hope the summer winds pursues
finding no end nor period of my pain
this is my state my griefs do touch so nearly
and thus i live because i love her dearly


why should i sing in verse why should i frame
these sad neglected notes for her dear sake
why should i offer up unto her name
the sweetest sacrifice my youth can make
why should i strive to make her live for ever
that never deigns to give me joy to live
why should mafflicted muse so much endeavour
such honour unto cruelty to give
if her defects have purchased her this fame
what should her virtues do her smiles her love
if this her worst how should her best inflame
what passions would her milder favours move
favours i think would sense quite overcome
and that makes happy lovers ever dumb


since the first look that led me to this error
to this thoughts maze to my confusion tending
still have i lived in grief in hope in terror
the circle of my sorrows never ending
yet cannot leave her love that holds me hateful
her eyes exact it though her heart disdains me
see what reward he hath that serves thungrateful
so true and loyal love no favour gains me
still must i whet my young desires abated
upon the flint of such a heart rebelling
and all in vain her pride is so innated
she yields no place at all for pitys dwelling
oft have i told her that my soul did love her
and that with tears yet all this will not move her


restore thy tresses to the golden ore
yield cythereas son those arks of love
bequeath the heavens the stars that i adore
and to the orient do thy pearls remove
yield thy hands pride unto the ivory white
tarabian odours give thy breathing sweet
restore thy blush unto aurora bright
to thetis give the honour of thy feet
let venus have the graces she resigned
and thy sweet voice give back unto the spheres
but yet restore thy fierce and cruel mind
to hyrcan tigers and to ruthless bears
yield to the marble thy hard heart again
so shalt thou cease to plague and i to pain


what it is to breathe and live without life
how to be pale with anguish red with fear
thave peace abroad and nought within but strife
wish to be present and yet shun tappear
how to be bold far off and bashful near
how to think much and have no words to speak
to crave redress yet hold affliction dear
to have affection strong a body weak
never to find yet evermore to seek
and seek that which i dare not hope to find
taffect this life and yet this life disleek
grateful tanother to myself unkind
this cruel knowledge of these contraries
delia my heart hath learned out of those eyes


if beauty thus be clouded with a frown
that pity shines no comfort to my bliss
and vapours of disdain so overgrown
that my lifes light wholly indarkened is
why should i more molest the world with cries
the air with sighs the earth below with tears
since i live hateful to those ruthful eyes
vexing with untuned moan her dainty ears
if i have loved her dearer than my breath
my breath that calls the heaven to witness it
and still hold her most dear until my death
and if that all this cannot move one whit
yet sure she cannot but must think apart
she doth me wrong to grieve so true a heart


come time the anchor hold of my desire
my last resort whereto my hopes appeal
cause once the date of her disdain texspire
make her the sentence of her wrath repeal
rob her fair brow break in on beauty steal
power from those eyes which pity cannot spare
deal with those dainty cheeks as she doth deal
with this poor heart consumed with despair
this heart made now the prospective of care
by loving her the cruelst fair that lives
the cruelst fair that sees i pine for her
and never mercy to thy merit gives
let her not still triumph over the prize
of mine affections taken by her eyes


time cruel time come and subdue that brow
which conquers all but thee and thee too stays
as if she were exempt from scythe or bow
from love or years unsubject to decays
or art thou grown in league with those fair eyes
that they may help thee to consume our days
or dost thou spare her for her cruelties
being merciless like thee that no man weighs
and yet thou seest thy power she disobeys
cares not for thee but lets thee waste in vain
and prodigal of hours and years betrays
beauty and youth topinion and disdain
yet spare her time let her exempted be
she may become more kind to thee or me


these sorrowing sighs the smoke of mine annoy
these tears which heat of sacred flame distils
are those due tributes that my faith doth pay
unto the tyrant whose unkindness kills
i sacrifice my youth and blooming years
at her proud feet and she respects not it
my flower untimelys withered with my tears
by winter woes for spring of youth unfit
she thinks a look may recompense my care
and so with looks prolongs my longlooked ease
as short that bliss so is the comfort rare
yet must that bliss my hungry thoughts appease
thus she returns my hopes so fruitless ever
once let her love indeed or eye me never


false hope prolongs my ever certain grief
traitor to me and faithful to my love
a thousand times it promised me relief
yet never any true effect i prove
oft when i find in her no truth at all
i banish her and blame her treachery
yet soon again i must her back recall
as one that dies without her company
thus often as i chase my hope from me
straightway she hastes her unto delias eyes
fed with some pleasing look there shall she be
and so sent back and thus my fortune lies
looks feed my hope hope fosters me in vain
hopes are unsure when certain is my pain


look in my griefs and blame me not to mourn
from care to care that leads a life so bad
thorphan of fortune born to be her scorn
whose clouded brow doth make my days so sad
long are their nights whose cares do never sleep
loathsome their days who never sun yet joyed
the impression of her eyes do pierce so deep
that thus i live both day and night annoyed
yet since the sweetest root yields fruit so sour
her praise from my complaint i may not part
i love theffect the cause being of this power
ill praise her face and blame her flinty heart
whilst we both make the world admire at us
her for disdain and me for loving thus


reignin my thoughts fair hand sweet eye rare voice
possess me whole my hearts triumvirate
yet heavy heart to make so hard a choice
of such as spoil thy poor afflicted state
for whilst they strive which shall be lord of all
all my poor life by them is trodden down
they all erect their trophies on my fall
and yield me nought that gives them their renown
when back i look i sigh my freedom past
and wail the state wherein i present stand
and see my fortune ever like to last
finding me reined with such a heavy hand
what can i do but yield and yield i do
and serve all three and yet they spoil me too


whilst by thy eyes pursued my poor heart flew
into the sacred refuge of thy breast
thy rigour in that sanctuary slew
that which thy succring mercy should have blest
no privilege of faith could it protect
faith being with blood and five years witness signed
wherein no show gave cause of least suspect
for well thou sawst my love and how i pined
yet no mild comfort would thy brow reveal
no lightning looks which falling hopes erect
what boots to laws of succour to appeal
ladies and tyrants never laws respect
then there i die from whence my life should come
and by that hand whom such deeds ill become


still in the trace of one perplexed thought
my ceaseless cares continually run on
seeking in vain what i have ever sought
one in my love and her hard heart still one
i who did never joy in other sun
and have no stars but those that must fulfil
the work of rigour fatally begun
upon this heart whom cruelty will kill
injurious deliayet i love thee still
and will whilst i shall draw this breath of mine
ill tell the world that i deserved but ill
and blame myself texcuse that heart of thine
see then who sins the greater of us twain
i in my love or thou in thy disdain


oft do i marvel whether delias eyes
are eyes or else two radiant stars that shine
for how could nature ever thus devise
of earth on earth a substance so divine
stars sure they are whose motions rule desires
and calm and tempest follow their aspects
their sweet appearing still such power inspires
that makes the world admire so strange effects
yet whether fixed or wandering stars are they
whose influence rules the orb of my poor heart
fixed sure they are but wandering make me stray
in endless errors whence i cannot part
stars then not eyes move you with milder view
your sweet aspect on him that honours you


the star of my mishap imposed this pain
to spend the april of my years in grief
finding my fortune ever in the wane
with still fresh cares supplied with no relief
yet thee i blame not though for thee tis done
but these weak wings presuming to aspire
which now are melted by thine eyes bright sun
that makes me fall from off my high desire
and in my fall i cry for help with speed
no pitying eye looks back upon my fears
no succour find i now when most i need
my heats must drown in thocean of my tears
which still must bear the title of my wrong
caused by those cruel beams that were so strong


and yet i cannot reprehend the flight
or blame thattempt presuming so to soar
the mounting venture for a high delight
did make the honour of the fall the more
for who gets wealth that puts not from the shore
danger hath honours great designs their fame
glory doth follow courage goes before
and though thevent oft answers not the same
suffice that high attempts have never shame
the mean observer whom base safety keeps
lives without honour dies without a name
and in eternal darkness ever sleeps
and therefore delia tis to me no blot
to have attempted though attained thee not


raising my hopes on hills of high desire
thinking to scale the heaven of her heart
my slender means presumed too high a part
her thunder of disdain forced me retire
and threw me down to pain in all this fire
where lo i languish in so heavy smart
because thattempt was far above my art
her pride brooked not poor souls should come so nigh her
yet i protest my high desiring will
was not to dispossess her of her right
her sovereignty should have remained still
i only sought the bliss to have her sight
her sight contented thus to see me spill
framed my desires fit for her eyes to kill


why dost thou delia credit so thy glass
gazing thy beauty deigned thee by the skies
and dost not rather look on him alas
whose state best shows the force of murdering eyes
the broken tops of lofty trees declare
the fury of a mercywanting storm
and of what force thy wounding graces are
upon myself you best may find the form
then leave thy glass and gaze thyself on me
that mirror shows what power is in thy face
to view your form too much may danger be
narcissus changed ta flower in such a case
and you are changed but not ta hyacinth
i fear your eye hath turned your heart to flint


i once may see when years shall wreck my wrong
and golden hairs shall change to silver wire
and those bright rays that kindle all this fire
shall fail in force their working not so strong
then beauty now the burden of my song
whose glorious blaze the world doth so admire
must yield up all to tyrant times desire
then fade those flowers that decked her pride so long
when if she grieve to gaze her in her glass
which then presents her whiterwithered hue
go you my verse go tell her what she was
for what she was she best shall find in you
your fiery heat lets not her glory pass
but phoenixlike shall make her live anew


look delia how westeem the halfblown rose
the image of thy blush and summers honour
whilst yet her tender bud doth undisclose
that full of beauty time bestows upon her
no sooner spreads her glory in the air
but straight her wideblown pomp comes to decline
she then is scorned that late adorned the fair
so fade the roses of those cheeks of thine
no april can revive thy withered flowers
whose springing grace adorns thy glory now
swift speedy time feathered with flying hours
dissolves the beauty of the fairest brow
then do not thou such treasure waste in vain
but love now whilst thou mayst be loved again


but love whilst that thou mayst be loved again
now whilst thy may hath filled thy lap with flowers
now whilst thy beauty bears without a stain
now use thy summer smiles ere winter lowers
and whilst thou spreadst unto the rising sun
the fairest flower that ever saw the light
now joy thy time before thy sweet be done
and delia think thy morning must have night
and that thy brightness sets at length to west
when thou wilt close up that which now thou showest
and think the same becomes thy fading best
which then shall most inveil and shadow most
men do not weigh the stalk for that it was
when once they find her flower her glory pass


when men shall find thy flower thy glory pass
and thou with careful brow sitting alone
received hast this message from thy glass
that tells the truth and says that all is gone
fresh shalt thou see in me the wounds thou madst
though spent thy flame in me the heat remaining
i that have loved thee thus before thou fadst
my faith shall wax when thou art in thy waning
the world shall find this miracle in me
that fire can burn when all the matters spent
then what my faith hath been thyself shalt see
and that thou wast unkind thou mayst repent
thou mayst repent that thou hast scorned my tears
when winter snows upon thy sable hairs


when winter snows upon thy sable hairs
and frost of age hath nipped thy beauties near
when dark shall seem thy day that never clears
and all lies withered that was held so dear
then take this picture which i here present thee
limned with a pencil not all unworthy
here see the gifts that god and nature lent thee
here read thyself and what i suffered for thee
this may remain thy lasting monument
which happily posterity may cherish
these colours with thy fading are not spent
these may remain when thou and i shall perish
if they remain then thou shalt live thereby
they will remain and so thou canst not die


thou canst not die whilst any zeal abound
in feeling hearts than can conceive these lines
though thou a laura hast no petrarch found
in base attire yet clearly beauty shines
and i though born within a colder clime
do feel mine inward heat as greati know it
he never had more faith although more rhyme
i love as well though he could better show it
but i may add one feather to thy fame
to help her flight throughout the fairest isle
and if my pen could more enlarge thy name
then shouldst thou live in an immortal style
for though that laura better limned be
suffice thou shalt be loved as well as she


be not displeased that these my papers should
bewray unto the world how fair thou art
or that my wits have showed the best they could
the chastest flame that ever warmed heart
think not sweet delia this shall be thy shame
my muse should sound thy praise with mournful warble
how many live the glory of whose name
shall rest in ice while thine is graved in marble
thou mayst in after ages live esteemed
unburied in these lines reserved in pureness
these shall entomb those eyes that have redeemed
me from the vulgar thee from all obscureness
although my careful accents never moved thee
yet count it no disgrace that i loved thee


delia these eyes that so admireth thine
have seen those walls which proud ambition reared
to check the world how they entombed have lain
within themselves and on them ploughs have eared
yet never found that barbarous hand attained
the spoil of fame deserved by virtuous men
whose glorious actions luckily had gained
theternal annals of a happy pen
and therefore grieve not if thy beauties die
though time do spoil thee of the fairest veil
that ever yet covered mortality
and must instar the needle and the rail
that grace which doth more than inwoman thee
lives in my lines and must eternal be


most fair and lovely maid look from the shore
see thy leander striving in these waves
poor soul quite spent whose force can do no more
now send forth hope for now calm pity saves
and waft him to thee with those lovely eyes
a happy convoy to a holy land
now show thy power and where thy virtue lies
to save thine own stretch out the fairest hand
stretch out the fairest hand a pledge of peace
that hand that darts so right and never misses
i shall forget old wrongs my griefs shall cease
and that which gave me wounds ill give it kisses
once let the ocean of my care find shore
that thou be pleased and i may sigh no more


read in my face a volume of despairs
the wailing iliads of my tragic woe
drawn with my blood and painted with my cares
wrought by her hand that i have honoured so
who whilst i burn she sings at my souls wrack
looking aloft from turret of her pride
there my souls tyrant joys her in the sack
of her own seat whereof i made her guide
there do these smokes that from affliction rise
serve as an incense to a cruel dame
a sacrifice thricegrateful to her eyes
because their power serves to exact the same
thus ruins she to satisfy her will
the temple where her name was honoured still


my delia hath the waters of mine eyes
the ready handmaids on her grace tattend
that never fail to ebb but ever rise
for to their flow she never grants an end
the ocean never did attend more duly
upon his sovereigns course the nights pale queen
nor paid the impost of his waves more truly
than mine unto her cruelty hath been
yet nought the rock of that hard heart can move
where beat these tears with zeal and fury drives
and yet id rather languish in her love
than i would joy the fairest she that lives
and if i find such pleasure to complain
what should i do then if i should obtain


how long shall i in mine affliction mourn
a burden to myself distressed in mind
when shall my interdicted hopes return
from out despair wherein they live confined
when shall her troubled brow charged with disdain
reveal the treasure which her smiles impart
when shall my faith the happiness attain
to break the ice that hath congealed her heart
unto herself herself my love doth summon
if love in her hath any power to move
and let her tell me as she is a woman
whether my faith hath not deserved her love
i know her heart cannot but judge with me
although her eyes my adversaries be


beauty sweet love is like the morning dew
whose short refresh upon the tender green
cheers for a time but till the sun doth show
and straight tis gone as it had never been
soon doth it fade that makes the fairest flourish
short is the glory of the blushing rose
the hue which thou so carefully dost nourish
yet which at length thou must be forced to lose
when thou surcharged with burden of thy years
shalt bend thy wrinkles homeward to the earth
and that in beautys lease expired appears
the date of age the kalends of our death
but ah no more this must not be foretold
for women grieve to think they must be old


i must not grieve my love whose eyes would read
lines of delight whereon her youth might smile
flowers have a time before they come to seed
and she is young and now must sport the while
ah sport sweet maid in season of these years
and learn to gather flowers before they wither
and where the sweetest blossoms first appears
let love and youth conduct thy pleasures thither
lighten forth smiles to clear the clouded air
and calm the tempest which my sighs do raise
pity and smiles do best become the fair
pity and smiles shall yield thee lasting praise
make me to say when all my griefs are gone
happy the heart that sighed for such a one


ah whither poor forsaken wilt thou go
to go from sorrow and thine own distress
when every place presents like face of woe
and no remove can make thy sorrows less
yet go forsaken leave these woods these plains
leave her and all and all for her that leaves
thee and thy love forlorn and both disdains
and of both wrongful deems and ill conceives
seek out some place and see if any place
can give the least release unto thy grief
convey thee from the thought of thy disgrace
steal from thyself and be thy cares own thief
but yet what comforts shall i hereby gain
bearing the wound i needs must feel the pain


drawn with thattractive virtue of her eyes
my touched heart turns it to that happy coast
my joyful north where all my fortune lies
the level of my hopes desired most
there where my delia fairer than the sun
decked with her youth whereon the world doth smile
joys in that honour which her eyes have won
theternal wonder of our happy isle
flourish fair albion glory of the north
neptunes best darling held between his arms
divided from the world as better worth
kept for himself defended from all harms
still let disarmed peace deck her and thee
and musefoe mars abroad far fostered be


carecharmer sleep son of the sable night
brother to death in silent darkness born
relieve my languish and restore the light
with dark forgetting of my care return
and let the day be time enough to mourn
the shipwreck of my illadventured youth
let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn
without the torment of the nights untruth
cease dreams the images of daydesires
to model forth the passions of the morrow
never let rising sun approve you liars
to add more grief to aggravate my sorrow
still let me sleep embracing clouds in vain
and never wake to feel the days disdain


let others sing of knights and paladins
in aged accents and untimely words
paint shadows in imaginary lines
which well the reach of their high wits records
but i must sing of thee and those fair eyes
authentic shall my verse in time to come
when yet thunborn shall say lo where she lies
whose beauty made him speak that else was dumb
these are the arks the trophies i erect
that fortify thy name against old age
and these thy sacred virtues must protect
against the dark and times consuming rage
though therror of my youth in them appear
suffice they show i lived and loved thee dear


as to the roman that would free his land
his error was his honour and renown
and more the fame of his mistaking hand
than if he had the tyrant overthrown
so delia hath mine error made me known
and my deceived attempt deserved more fame
than if had the victory mine own
and thy hard heart had yielded up the same
and so likewise renowned is thy blame
thy cruelty thy glory o strange case
that errors should be graced that merit shame
and sin of frowns bring honour to the face
yet happy delia that thou wast unkind
though happier far if thou wouldst change thy mind


like as the lute delights or else dislikes
as is his art that plays upon the same
so sounds my muse according as she strikes
on my heartstrings high tuned unto her fame
her touch doth cause the warble of the sound
which here i yield in lamentable wise
a wailing descant on the sweetest ground
whose due reports give honour to her eyes
else harsh my style untunable my muse
hoarse sounds the voice that praiseth not her name
if any pleasing relish here i use
then judge the world her beauty gives the same
for no ground else could make the music such
nor other hand could give so sweet a touch


none other fame mine unambitious muse
affected ever but teternise thee
all other honours do my hopes refuse
which meaner prized and momentary be
for god forbid i should my papers blot
with mercenary lines with servile pen
praising virtues in them that have them not
basely attending on the hopes of men
no no my verse respects not thames nor theatres
nor seeks it to be known unto the great
but avon poor in fame and poor in waters
shall have my song where delia hath her seat
avon shall be my thames and she my song
no other prouder brooks shall hear my wrong


unhappy pen and illaccepted lines
that intimate in vain my chaste desire
my chaste desire which from dark sorrow shines
enkindled by her eyes celestial fire
celestial fire and unrespecting powers
which pity not the wounds made by their might
showed in these lines the work of careful hours
the sacrifice here offered to her sight
but since she weighs them not this rests for me
ill moan myself and hide the wrong i have
and so content me that her frowns should be
to minfant style the cradle and the grave
what though my muse no honour get thereby
each bird sings to herself and so will i


lo here the impost of a faith entire
that love doth pay and her disdain extorts
behold the message of a chaste desire
that tells the world how much my grief imports
these tributary passions beautys due
i send those eyes the cabinets of love
that cruelty herself might grieve to view
thaffliction her unkind disdain doth move
and how i live cast down from off all mirth
pensive alone only but with despair
my joys abortive perish in their birth
my griefs longlived and care succeeding care
this is my state and delias heart is such
i say no more i fear i said too much

into these loves who but for passion looks
at this first sight here let him lay them by
and seek elsewhere in turning other books
which better may his labour satisfy
no farfetched sigh shall ever wound my breast
love from mine eye a tear shall never wring
nor in ah mes my whining sonnets drest
a libertine fantasticly i sing
my verse is the true image of my mind
ever in motion still desiring change
to choice of all variety inclined
and in all humours sportively i range
my muse is rightly of the english strain
that cannot long one fashion entertain


like an adventurous seafarer am i
who hath some long and dangrous voyage been
and called to tell of his discovery
how far he sailed what countries he had seen
proceeding from the port whence he put forth
shows by his compass how his course he steered
when east when west when south and when by north
as how the pole to every place was reared
what capes he doubled of what continent
the gulfs and straits that strangely he had past
where most becalmed where with foul weather spent
and on what rocks in peril to be cast
thus in my love time calls me to relate
my tedious travels and oftvarying fate


my heart was slain and none but you and i
who should i think the murder should commit
since but yourself there was no creature by
but only i guiltless of murdering it
it slew itself the verdict on the view
do quit the dead and me not accessary
well well i fear it will be proved by you
the evidence so great a proof doth carry
but o see see we need inquire no further
upon your lips the scarlet drops are found
and in your eye the boy that did the murder
your cheeks yet pale since first he gave the wound
by this i see however things be past
yet heaven will still have murder out at last


taking my pen with words to cast my woe
duly to count the sum of all my cares
i find my griefs innumerable grow
the recknings rise to millions of despairs
and thus dividing of my fatal hours
the payments of my love i read and cross
subtracting set my sweets unto my sours
my joys arrearage leads me to my loss
and thus mine eyes a debtor to thine eye
which by extortion gaineth all their looks
my heart hath paid such grievous usury
that all their wealth lies in thy beautys books
and all is thine which hath been due to me
and i a bankrupt quite undone by thee


bright star of beauty on whose eyelids sit
a thousand nymphlike and enamoured graces
the goddesses of memory and wit
which there in order take their several places
in whose dear bosom sweet delicious love
lays down his quiver which he once did bear
since he that blessed paradise did prove
and leaves his mothers lap to sport him there
let others strive to entertain with words
my soul is of a braver mettle made
i hold that vile which vulgar wit affords
in mes that faith which time cannot invade
let what i praise be still made good by you
be you most worthy whilst i am most true


nothing but no and ia and i and no
how falls it out so strangely you reply
i tell ye fair ill not be answered so
with this affirming no denying i
i say i love you slightly answer i
i say you love you pule me out a no
i say i die you echo me with i
save me i cry you sigh me out a no
must woe and i have naught but no and i
no i am i if i no more can have
answer no more with silence make reply
and let me take myself what i do crave
let no and i with i and you be so
then answer no and i and i and no


how many paltry foolish painted things
that now in coaches trouble every street
shall be forgotten whom no poet sings
ere they be well wrapped in their winding sheet
where i to thee eternity shall give
when nothing else remaineth of these days
and queens hereafter shall be glad to live
upon the alms of thy superfluous praise
virgins and matrons reading these my rhymes
shall be so much delighted with thy story
that they shall grieve they lived not in these times
to have seen thee their sexs only glory
so shalt thou fly above the vulgar throng
still to survive in my immortal song


love in a humour played the prodigal
and bade my senses to a solemn feast
yet more to grace the company withal
invites my heart to be the chiefest guest
no other drink would serve this gluttons turn
but precious tears distilling from mine eyne
which with my sighs this epicure doth burn
quaffing carouses in this costly wine
where in his cups oercome with foul excess
straightways he plays a swaggering ruffians part
and at the banquet in his drunkenness
slew his dear friend my kind and truest heart
a gentle warning friends thus may you see
what tis to keep a drunkard company


theres nothing grieves me but that age should haste
that in my days i may not see thee old
that where those two clear sparkling eyes are placed
only two loopholes that i might behold
that lovely arched ivorypolished brow
defaced with wrinkles that i might but see
thy dainty hair so curled and crisped now
like grizzled moss upon some aged tree
thy cheek now flush with roses sunk and lean
thy lips with age as any wafer thin
thy pearly teeth out of thy head so clean
that when thou feedst thy nose shall touch thy chin
these lines that now thou scornst which should delight thee
then would i make thee read but to despite thee


as other men so i myself do muse
why in this sort i wrest invention so
and why these giddy metaphors i use
leaving the path the greater part do go
i will resolve you im a lunatic
and ever this in madmen you shall find
what they last thought of when the brain grew sick
in most distraction they keep that in mind
thus talking idly in this bedlam fit
reason and i you must conceive are twain
tis nine years now since first i lost my wit
bear with me then though troubled be my brain
with diet and correction men distraught
not too far past may to their wits be brought


to nothing fitter can i thee compare
than to the son of some rich pennyfather
who having now brought on his end with care
leaves to his son all he had heaped together
this new rich novice lavish of his chest
to one man gives doth on another spend
then here he riots yet amongst the rest
haps to lend some to one true honest friend
thy gifts thou in obscurity dost waste
false friends thy kindness born but to deceive thee
thy love that is on the unworthy placed
time hath thy beauty which with age will leave thee
only that little which to me was lent
i give thee back when all the rest is spent


youre not alone when you are still alone
o god from you that i could private be
since you one were i never since was one
since you in me myself since out of me
transported from myself into your being
though either distant present yet to either
senseless with too much joy each other seeing
and only absent when we are together
give me my self and take your self again
devise some means but how i may forsake you
so much is mine that doth with you remain
that taking what is mine with me i take you
you do bewitch me o that i could fly
from my self you or from your own self i


that learned father which so firmly proves
the soul of man immortal and divine
and doth the several offices define
_anima_ gives her that name as she the body moves
_amor_ then is she love embracing charity
_animus_ moving a will in us it is the mind
_mens_ retaining knowledge still the same in kind
_memoria_ as intellectual it is memory
_ratio_ in judging reason only is her name
_sensus_ in speedy apprehension it is sense
_conscientia_ in right and wrong they call her conscience
_spiritus_ the spirit when it to godward doth inflame
these of the soul the several functions be
which my heart lightened by thy love doth see


letters and lines we see are soon defaced
metals do waste and fret with cankers rust
the diamond shall once consume to dust
and freshest colours with foul stains disgraced
paper and ink can paint but naked words
to write with blood of force offends the sight
and if with tears i find them all too light
and sighs and signs a silly hope affords
o sweetest shadow how thou servst my turn
which still shalt be as long as there is sun
nor whilst the world is never shall be done
whilst moon shall shine or any fire shall burn
that everything whence shadow doth proceed
may in his shadow my loves story read


if he from heaven that filched that living fire
condemned by jove to endless torment be
i greatly marvel how you still go free
that far beyond prometheus did aspire
the fire he stole although of heavenly kind
which from above he craftily did take
of lifeless clods us living men to make
he did bestow in temper of the mind
but you broke into heavens immortal store
where virtue honour wit and beauty lay
which taking thence you have escaped away
yet stand as free as eer you did before
yet old prometheus punished for his rape
thus poor thieves suffer when the greater scape


since to obtain thee nothing me will stead
i have a medcine that shall cure my love
the powder of her heart dried when shes dead
that gold nor honour neer had power to move
mixed with her tears that neer her true love crost
nor at fifteen neer longed to be a bride
boiled with her sighs in giving up the ghost
that for her late deceased husband died
into the same then let a woman breathe
that being chid did never word reply
with one thrice marrieds prayers that did bequeath
a legacy to stale virginity
if this receipt have not the power to win me
little ill say but think the devils in me


mongst all the creatures in this spacious round
of the birds kind the phoenix is alone
which best by you of living things is known
none like to that none like to you is found
your beauty is the hot and splendrous sun
the precious spices be your chaste desire
which being kindled by that heavenly fire
your life so like the phoenixs begun
yourself thus burned in that sacred flame
with so rare sweetness all the heavens perfuming
again increasing as you are consuming
only by dying born the very same
and winged by fame you to the stars ascend
so you of time shall live beyond the end


stay speedy time behold before thou pass
from age to age what thou hast sought to see
one in whom all the excellencies be
in whom heaven looks itself as in a glass
time look thou too in this translucent glass
and thy youth past in this pure mirror see
as the worlds beauty in his infancy
what it was then and thou before it was
pass on and to posterity tell this
yet see thou tell but truly what hath been
say to our nephews that thou once hast seen
in perfect human shape all heavenly bliss
and bid them mourn nay more despair with thee
that she is gone her like again to see


to this our world to learning and to heaven
three nines there are to every one a nine
one number of the earth the other both divine
one woman now makes three odd numbers even
nine orders first of angels be in heaven
nine muses do with learning still frequent
these with the gods are ever resident
nine worthy women to the world were given
my worthy one to these nine worthies addeth
and my fair muse one muse unto the nine
and my good angel in my soul divine
with one more order these nine orders gladdeth
my muse my worthy and my angel then
makes every one of these three nines a ten


you cannot love my pretty heart and why
there was a time you told me that you would
but how again you will the same deny
if it might please you would to god you could
what will you hate nay that you will not neither
nor love nor hate how then what will you do
what will you keep a mean then betwixt either
or will you love me and yet hate me too
yet serves not this what next what other shift
you will and will not what a coil is here
i see your craft now i perceive your drift
and all this while i was mistaken there
your love and hate is this i now do prove you
you love in hate by hate to make me love you


an evil spirit your beauty haunts me still
wherewith alas i have been long possessed
which ceaseth not to tempt me to each ill
nor give me once but one poor minutes rest
in me it speaks whether i sleep or wake
and when by means to drive it out i try
with greater torments then it me doth take
and tortures me in most extremity
before my face it lays down my despairs
and hastes me on unto a sudden death
now tempting me to drown myself in tears
and then in sighing to give up my breath
thus am i still provoked to every evil
by this good wicked spirit sweet angeldevil


a witless gallant a young wench that wooed
yet his dull spirit her not one jot could move
intreated me as eer i wished his good
to write him but one sonnet to his love
when i as fast as eer my pen could trot
poured out what first from quick invention came
nor never stood one word thereof to blot
much like his wit that was to use the same
but with my verses he his mistress won
who doated on the dolt beyond all measure
but see for you to heaven for phrase i run
and ransack all apollos golden treasure
yet by my troth this fool his love obtains
and i lose you for all my wit and pains


with fools and children good discretion bears
then honest people bear with love and me
nor older yet nor wiser made by years
amongst the rest of fools and children be
love still a baby plays with gauds and toys
and like a wanton sports with every feather
and idiots still are running after boys
then fools and children fittst to go together
he still as young as when he first was born
nor wiser i than when as young as he
you that behold us laugh us not to scorn
give nature thanks you are not such as we
yet fools and children sometimes tell in play
some wise in show more fools indeed than they


love banished heaven in earth was held in scorn
wandring abroad in need and beggary
and wanting friends though of a goddess born
yet craved the alms of such as passed by
i like a man devout and charitable
clothed the naked lodged this wandering guest
with sighs and tears still furnishing his table
with what might make the miserable blest
but this ungrateful for my good desert
enticed my thoughts against me to conspire
who gave consent to steal away my heart
and set my breast his lodging on a fire
well well my friends when beggars grow thus bold
no marvel then though charity grow cold


i hear some say this man is not in love
who can he love a likely thing they say
read but his verse and it will easily prove
o judge not rashly gentle sir i pray
because i loosely trifle in this sort
as one that fain his sorrows would beguile
you now suppose me all this time in sport
and please yourself with this conceit the while
ye shallow censrers sometimes see ye not
in greatest perils some men pleasant be
where fame by death is only to be got
they resolute so stands the case with me
where other men in depth of passion cry
i laugh at fortune as in jest to die


o why should nature niggardly restrain
that foreign nations relish not our tongue
else should my lines glide on the waves of rhine
and crown the pyrens with my living song
but bounded thus to scotland get you forth
thence take you wing unto the orcades
there let my verse get glory in the north
making my sighs to thaw the frozen seas
and let the bards within that irish isle
to whom my muse with fiery wings shall pass
call back the stiffnecked rebels from exile
and mollify the slaughtering gallow glass
and when my flowing numbers they rehearse
let wolves and bears be charmed with my verse


i ever love where never hope appears
yet hope draws on my neverhoping care
and my lifes hope would die but for despair
my never certain joy breeds ever certain fears
uncertain dread gives wings unto my hope
yet my hopes wings are laden so with fear
as they cannot ascend to my hopes sphere
though fear gives them more than a heavenly scope
yet this large room is bounded with despair
so my love is still fettered with vain hope
and liberty deprives him of his scope
and thus am i imprisoned in the air
then sweet despair awhile hold up thy head
or all my hope for sorrow will be dead


is not love here as tis in other climes
and differeth it as do the several nations
or hath it lost the virtue with the times
or in this island altreth with the fashions
or have our passions lesser power than theirs
who had less art them lively to express
is nature grown less powerful in their heirs
or in our fathers did she more transgress
i am sure my sighs come from a heart as true
as any mans that memory can boast
and my respects and services to you
equal with his that loves his mistress most
or nature must be partial in my cause
or only you do violate her laws


to such as say thy love i overprize
and do not stick to term my praises folly
against these folks that think themselves so wise
i thus oppose my reasons forces wholly
though i give more than well affords my state
in which expense the most suppose me vain
which yields them nothing at the easiest rate
yet at this price returns me treble gain
they value not unskilful how to use
and i give much because i gain thereby
i that thus take or they that thus refuse
whether are these deceived then or i
in everything i hold this maxim still
the circumstance doth make it good or ill


when conquering love did first my heart assail
unto mine aid i summoned every sense
doubting if that proud tyrant should prevail
my heart should suffer for mine eyes offence
but he with beauty first corrupted sight
my hearing bribed with her tongues harmony
my taste by her sweet lips drawn with delight
my smelling won with her breaths spicery
but when my touching came to play his part
the king of senses greater than the rest
he yields love up the keys unto my heart
and tells the others how they should be blest
and thus by those of whom i hoped for aid
to cruel love my soul was first betrayed


those priests which first the vestal fire begun
which might be borrowed from no earthly flame
devised a vessel to receive the sun
being stedfastly opposed to the same
where with sweet wood laid curiously by art
on which the sun might by reflection beat
receiving strength for every secret part
the fuel kindled with celestial heat
thy blessed eyes the sun which lights this fire
my holy thoughts they be the vestal flame
thy precious odours be my chaste desires
my breasts the vessel which includes the same
thou art my vesta thou my goddess art
thy hallowed temple only is my heart


methinks i see some crooked mimic jeer
and tax my muse with this fantastic grace
turning my papers asks what have we here
making withal some filthy antic face
i fear no censure nor what thou canst say
nor shall my spirit one jot of vigour lose
thinkst thou my wit shall keep the packhorse way
that every dudgeon low invention goes
since sonnets thus in bundles are imprest
and every drudge doth dull our satiate ear
thinkst thou my love shall in those rags be drest
that every dowdy every trull doth wear
up to my pitch no common judgment flies
i scorn all earthly dungbred scarabies


our floods queen thames for ships and swans is crowned
and stately severn for her shore is praised
the crystal trent for fords and fish renowned
and avons fame to albions cliff is raised
carlegion chester vaunts her holy dee
york many wonders of her ouse can tell
the peak her dove whose banks so fertile be
and kent will say her medway doth excel
cotswold commends her isis to the thame
our northern borders boast of tweeds fair flood
our western parts extol their wilis fame
and the old lea brags of the danish blood
ardens sweet ankor let thy glory be
that fair idea only lives by thee


whilst yet mine eyes do surfeit with delight
my woful heart imprisoned in my breast
wisheth to be transformed to my sight
that it like those by looking might be blest
but whilst mine eyes thus greedily do gaze
finding their objects oversoon depart
these now the others happiness do praise
wishing themselves that they had been my heart
that eyes were heart or that the heart were eyes
as covetous the others use to have
but finding nature their request denies
this to each other mutually they crave
that since the one cannot the other be
that eyes could think of that my heart could see


marvel not love though i thy power admire
ravished a world beyond the farthest thought
and knowing more than ever hath been taught
that i am only starved in my desire
marvel not love though i thy power admire
aiming at things exceeding all perfection
to wisdoms self to minister direction
that i am only starved in my desire
marvel not love though i thy power admire
though my conceit i further seem to bend
than possibly invention can extend
and yet am only starved in my desire
if thou wilt wonder heres the wonder love
that this to me doth yet no wonder prove


some misbelieving and profane in love
when i do speak of miracles by thee
may say that thou art flattered by me
who only write my skill in verse to prove
see miracles ye unbelieving see
a dumbborn muse made to express the mind
a cripple hand to write yet lame by kind
one by thy name the other touching thee
blind were mine eyes till they were seen of thine
and mine ears deaf by thy fame healed be
my vices cured by virtues sprung from thee
my hopes revived which long in grave had lien
all unclean thoughts foul spirits cast out in me
only by virtue that proceeds from thee


thou purblind boy since thou hast been so slack
to wound her heart whose eyes have wounded me
and suffered her to glory in my wrack
thus to my aid i lastly conjure thee
by hellish styx by which the thundrer swears
by thy fair mothers unavoided power
by hecates names by proserpines sad tears
when she was wrapt to the infernal bower
by thine own loved psyche by the fires
spent on thine altars flaming up to heaven
by all true lovers sighs vows and desires
by all the wounds that ever thou hast given
i conjure thee by all that i have named
to make her love or cupid be thou damned


dear why should you command me to my rest
when now the night doth summon all to sleep
methinks this time becometh lovers best
night was ordained together friends to keep
how happy are all other living things
which though the day disjoin by several flight
the quiet evening yet together brings
and each returns unto his love at night
o thou that art so courteous else to all
why shouldst thou night abuse me only thus
that every creature to his kind dost call
and yet tis thou dost only sever us
well could i wish it would be ever day
if when night comes you bid me go away


sitting alone love bids me go and write
reason plucks back commanding me to stay
boasting that she doth still direct the way
or else love were unable to indite
love growing angry vexed at the spleen
and scorning reasons maimed argument
straight taxeth reason wanting to invent
where she with love conversing hath not been
reason reproached with this coy disdain
despiteth love and laugheth at her folly
and love contemning reasons reason wholly
thought it in weight too light by many a grain
reason put back doth out of sight remove
and love alone picks reason out of love


some when in rhyme they of their loves do tell
with flames and lightnings their exordiums paint
some call on heaven some invocate on hell
and fates and furies with their woes acquaint
elizium is too high a seat for me
i will not come in styx or phlegethon
the thricethree muses but too wanton be
like they that lust i care not i will none
spiteful erinnys frights me with her looks
my manhood dares not with foul ate mell
i quake to look on hecates charming books
i still fear bugbears in apollos cell
i pass not for minerva nor astrea
only i call on my divine idea


my heart the anvil where my thoughts do beat
my words the hammers fashioning my desire
my breast the forge including all the heat
love is the fuel which maintains the fire
my sighs the bellows which the flame increaseth
filling mine ears with noise and nightly groaning
toiling with pain my labour never ceaseth
in grievous passions my woes still bemoaning
my eyes with tears against the fire striving
whose scorching gleed my heart to cinders turneth
but with those drops the flame again reviving
still more and more it to my torment burneth
with sisyphus thus do i roll the stone
and turn the wheel with damned ixion


why do i speak of joy or write of love
when my heart is the very den of horror
and in my soul the pains of hell i prove
with all his torments and infernal terror
what should i say what yet remains to do
my brain is dry with weeping all too long
my sighs be spent in uttring of my woe
and i want words wherewith to tell my wrong
but still distracted in loves lunacy
and bedlamlike thus raving in my grief
now rail upon her hair then on her eye
now call her goddess then i call her thief
now i deny her then i do confess her
now do i curse her then again i bless her


some men there be which like my method well
and much commend the strangeness of my vein
some say i have a passing pleasing strain
some say that in my humour i excel
some who not kindly relish my conceit
they say as poets do i use to feign
and in bare words paint out by passions pain
thus sundry men their sundry minds repeat
i pass not i how men affected be
nor who commends or discommends my verse
it pleaseth me if i my woes rehearse
and in my lines if she my love may see
only my comfort still consists in this
writing her praise i cannot write amiss


why should your fair eyes with such sovreign grace
disperse their rays on every vulgar spirit
whilst i in darkness in the selfsame place
get not one glance to recompense my merit
so doth the plowman gaze the wandring star
and only rest contented with the light
that never learned what constellations are
beyond the bent of his unknowing sight
o why should beauty custom to obey
to their gross sense apply herself so ill
would god i were as ignorant as they
when i am made unhappy by my skill
only compelled on this poor good to boast
heavens are not kind to them that know them most


whilst thus my pen strives to eternise thee
age rules my lines with wrinkles in my face
where in the map of all my misery
is modelled out the world of my disgrace
whilst in despite of tyrannising times
medealike i make thee young again
proudly thou scornst my worldoutwearing rhymes
and murtherst virtue with thy coy disdain
and though in youth my youth untimely perish
to keep thee from oblivion and the grave
ensuing ages yet my rhymes shall cherish
where i intombed my better part shall save
and though this earthly body fade and die
my name shall mount upon eternity


muses which sadly sit about my chair
drowned in the tears extorted by my lines
with heavy sighs whilst thus i break the air
painting my passions in these sad designs
since she disdains to bless my happy verse
the strong built trophies to her living fame
ever henceforth my bosom be your hearse
wherein the world shall now entomb her name
enclose my music you poor senseless walls
sith she is deaf and will not hear my moans
soften yourselves with every tear that falls
whilst i like orpheus sing to trees and stones
which with my plaint seem yet with pity moved
kinder than she whom i so long have loved


plainpathed experience the unlearneds guide
her simple followers evidently shows
sometimes what schoolmen scarcely can decide
nor yet wise reason absolutely knows
in making trial of a murder wrought
if the vile actors of the heinous deed
near the dead body happily be brought
oft t hath been proved the breathless corse will bleed
she coming near that my poor heart hath slain
long since departed to the world no more
the ancient wounds no longer can contain
but fall to bleeding as they did before
but what of this should she to death be led
it furthers justice but helps not the dead


in pride of wit when high desire of fame
gave life and courage to my labring pen
and first the sound and virtue of my name
won grace and credit in the ears of men
with those the thronged theatres that press
i in the circuit for the laurel strove
where the full praise i freely must confess
in heat of blood a modest mind might move
with shouts and claps at every little pause
when the proud round on every side hath rung
sadly i sit unmoved with the applause
as though to me it nothing did belong
no public glory vainly i pursue
all that i seek is to eternise you


cupid i hate thee which id have thee know
a naked starveling ever mayst thou be
poor rogue go pawn thy fascia and thy bow
for some poor rags wherewith to cover thee
or if thoult not thy archery forbear
to some base rustic do thyself prefer
and when corns sown or grown into the ear
practice thy quiver and turn crowkeeper
or being blind as fittest for the trade
go hire thyself some bungling harpers boy
they that are blind are minstrels often made
so mayst thou live to thy fair mothers joy
that whilst with mars she holdeth her old way
thou her blind son mayst sit by them and play


thou leaden brain which censurst what i write
and sayst my lines be dull and do not move
i marvel not thou feelst not my delight
which never feltst my fiery touch of love
but thou whose pen hath like a packhorse served
whose stomach unto gall hath turned thy food
whose senses like poor prisoners hungerstarved
whose grief hath parched thy body dried thy blood
thou which hast scorned life and hated death
and in a moment mad sober glad and sorry
thou which hast banned thy thoughts and curst thy birth
with thousand plagues more than in purgatory
thou thus whose spirit love in his fire refines
come thou and read admire applaud my lines


as in some countries far remote from hence
the wretched creature destined to die
having the judgment due to his offence
by surgeons begged their art on him to try
which on the living work without remorse
first make incision on each mastering vein
then staunch the bleeding then transpierce the corse
and with their balms recure the wounds again
then poison and with physic him restore
not that they fear the hopeless man to kill
but their experience to increase the more
even so my mistress works upon my ill
by curing me and killing me each hour
only to show her beautys sovereign power


calling to mind since first my love begun
thuncertain times oft varying in their course
how things still unexpectedly have run
ast please the fates by their resistless force
lastly mine eyes amazedly have seen
essexs great fall tyrone his peace to gain
the quiet end of that long living queen
this kings fair entrance and our peace with spain
we and the dutch at length ourselves to sever
thus the world doth and evermore shall reel
yet to my goddess am i constant ever
howeer blind fortune turn her giddy wheel
though heaven and earth prove both to me untrue
yet am i still inviolate to you


what dost thou mean to cheat me of my heart
to take all mine and give me none again
or have thine eyes such magic or that art
that what they get they ever do retain
play not the tyrant but take some remorse
rebate thy spleen if but for pitys sake
or cruel if thou canst not let us scorse
and for one piece of thine my whole heart take
but what of pity do i speak to thee
whose breast is proof against complaint or prayer
or can i think what my reward shall be
from that proud beauty which was my betrayer
what talk i of a heart when thou hast none
or if thou hast it is a flinty one


clear ankor on whose silversanded shore
my soulshrined saint my fair idea lives
o blessed brook whose milkwhite swans adore
thy crystal stream refined by her eyes
where sweet myrrhbreathing zephyr in the spring
gently distils his nectardropping showers
where nightingales in arden sit and sing
amongst the dainty dewimpearled flowers
say thus fair brook when thou shalt see thy queen
lo here thy shepherd spent his wandring years
and in these shades dear nymph he oft hath been
and here to thee he sacrificed his tears
fair arden thou my tempe art alone
and thou sweet ankor art my helicon


yet read at last the story of my woe
the dreary abstracts of my endless cares
with my lifes sorrow interlined so
smoked with my sighs and blotted with my tears
the sad memorials of my miseries
penned in the grief of mine afflicted ghost
my lifes complaint in doleful elegies
with so pure love as time could never boast
receive the incense which i offer here
by my strong faith ascending to thy fame
my zeal my hope my vows my praise my prayer
my souls oblations to thy sacred name
which name my muse to highest heavens shall raise
by chaste desire true love and virtuous praise


my fair if thou wilt register my love
a world of volumes shall thereof arise
preserve my tears and thou thyself shall prove
a second flood down raining from mine eyes
note but my sighs and thine eyes shall behold
the sunbeams smothered with immortal smoke
and if by thee my prayers may be enrolled
they heaven and earth to pity shall provoke
look thou into my breast and thou shalt see
chaste holy vows for my souls sacrifice
that soul sweet maid which so hath honoured thee
erecting trophies to thy sacred eyes
those eyes to my heart shining ever bright
when darkness hath obscured each other light


when like an eaglet i first found my love
for that the virtue i thereof would know
upon the nest i set it forth to prove
if it were of that kingly kind or no
but it no sooner saw my sun appear
but on her rays with open eyes it stood
to show that i had hatched it for the air
and rightly came from that brave mounting brood
and when the plumes were summed with sweet desire
to prove the pinions it ascends the skies
do what i could it needsly would aspire
to my souls sun those two celestial eyes
thus from my breast where it was bred alone
it after thee is like an eaglet flown


you best discerned of my minds inward eyes
and yet your graces outwardly divine
whose dear remembrance in my bosom lies
too rich a relic for so poor a shrine
you in whom nature chose herself to view
when she her own perfection would admire
bestowing all her excellence on you
at whose pure eyes love lights his hallowed fire
even as a man that in some trance hath seen
more than his wondring utterance can unfold
that rapt in spirit in better worlds hath been
so must your praise distractedly be told
most of all short when i would show you most
in your perfections so much am i lost


in former times such as had store of coin
in wars at home or when for conquests bound
for fear that some their treasure should purloin
gave it to keep to spirits within the ground
and to attend it them as strongly tied
till they returned home when they never came
such as by art to get the same have tried
from the strong spirit by no means force the same
nearer men come that further flies away
striving to hold it strongly in the deep
evn as this spirit so you alone do play
with those rich beauties heavn gives you to keep
pity so left to th coldness of your blood
not to avail you nor do others good


as love and i late harboured in one inn
with proverbs thus each other entertain
in love there is no lack thus i begin
fair words make fools replieth he again
who spares to speak doth spare to speed quoth i
as well saith he too forward as too slow
fortune assists the boldest i reply
a hasty man quoth he neer wanted woe
labour is light where love quoth i doth pay
saith he light burdens heavy if far born
quoth i the main lost cast the by away
you have spun a fair thread he replies in scorn
and having thus awhile each other thwarted
fools as we met so fools again we parted


define my weal and tell the joys of heaven
express my woes and show the pains of hell
declare what fate unlucky stars have given
and ask a world upon my life to dwell
make known the faith that fortune could no move
compare my worth with others base desert
let virtue be the touchstone of my love
so may the heavens read wonders in my heart
behold the clouds which have eclipsed my sun
and view the crosses which my course do let
tell me if ever since the world begun
so fair a rising had so foul a set
and see if time if he would strive to prove
can show a second to so pure a love


since theres no help come let us kiss and part
nay i have done you get no more of me
and i am glad yea glad with all my heart
that thus so cleanly i myself can free
shakes hands for ever cancel all our vows
and when we meet at any time again
be it not seen in either of our brows
that we one jot of former love retain
now at the last gasp of loves latest breath
when his pulse failing passion speechless lies
when faith is kneeling by his bed of death
and innocence is closing up his eyes
now if thou wouldst when all have given him over
from death to life thou mightst him yet recover


when first i ended then i first began
then more i travelled further from my rest
where most i lost there most of all i won
pined with hunger rising from a feast
methinks i fly yet want i legs to go
wise in conceit in act a very sot
ravished with joy amidst a hell of woe
what most i seem that surest am i not
i build my hopes a world above the sky
yet with the mole i creep into the earth
in plenty i am starved with penury
and yet i surfeit in the greatest dearth
i have i want despair and yet desire
burned in a sea of ice and drowned amidst a fire


truce gentle love a parley now i crave
methinks tis long since first these wars begun
nor thou nor i the better yet can have
bad is the match where neither party won
i offer free conditions of fair peace
my heart for hostage that it shall remain
discharge our forces here let malice cease
so for my pledge thou give me pledge again
or if no thing but death will serve thy turn
still thirsting for subversion of my state
do what thou canst raze massacre and burn
let the world see the utmost of thy hate
i send defiance since if overthrown
thou vanquishing the conquest is mine own


thine eyes taught me the alphabet of love
to con my crossrow ere i learned to spell
for i was apt a scholar like to prove
gave me sweet looks whenas i learned well
vows were my vowels when i then begun
at my first lesson in thy sacred name
my consonants the next when i had done
words consonant and sounding to thy fame
my liquids then were liquid crystal tears
my cares my mutes so mute to crave relief
my doleful diphthongs were my lifes despairs
redoubling sighs the accents of my grief
my loves schoolmistress now hath taught me so
that i can read a story of my woe


reading sometime my sorrows to beguile
i find old poets hills and floods admire
one he doth wonder monsterbreeding nile
another marvels sulpjur etnas fire
now broadbrimmed indus then of pindus height
pelion and ossa frosty caucase old
the delian cynthus then olympus weight
slow arar frantic gallus cydnus cold
some ganges ister and of tagus tell
some whirlpool po and sliding hypasis
some old parnassus where the muses dwell
some helicon and some fair simois
ah fools think i had you idea seen
poor brooks and banks had no such wonders been


since holy vestal laws have been neglected
the gods pure fire hath been extinguished quite
no virgin once attending on that light
nor yet those heavenly secrets once respected
till thou alone to pay the heavens their duty
within the temple of thy sacred name
with thine eyes kindling that celestial flame
by those reflecting sunbeams of thy beauty
here chastity that vestal most divine
attends that lamp with eye which never sleepeth
the volumes of religions laws she keepeth
making thy breast that sacred relics shrine
where blessed angels singing day and night
praise him which made that fire which lends that light


my fair look from those turrets of thine eyes
into the ocean of a troubled mind
where my poor soul the bark of sorrow lies
left to the mercy of the waves and wind
see where she floats laden with purest love
which those fair islands of thy looks afford
desiring yet a thousand deaths to prove
than so to cast her ballast overboard
see how her sails be rent her tacklings worn
her cable broke her surest anchor lost
her mariners do leave her all forlorn
yet how she bends towards that blessed coast
lo where she drowns in storms of thy displeasure
whose worthy prize should have enriched thy treasure


if chaste and pure devotion of my youth
or glory of my aprilspringing years
unfeignd love in naked simple truth
a thousand vows a thousand sighs and tears
or if a world of faithful service done
words thoughts and deeds devoted to her honour
or eyes that have beheld her as their sun
with admiration ever looking on her
a life that never joyed but in her love
a soul that ever hath adored her name
a faith that time nor fortune could not move
a muse that unto heaven hath raised her fame
though these nor these deserve to be embraced
yet fair unkind too good to be disgraced


die die my soul and never taste of joy
if sighs nor tears nor vows nor prayers can move
if faith and zeal be but esteemed a toy
and kindness be unkindness in my love
then with unkindness love revenge thy wrong
o sweetst revenge that eer the heavens gave
and with the swan record thy dying song
and praise her still to thy untimely grave
so in loves death shall loves perfection prove
that love divine which i have borne to you
by doom conceald to heavens above
that yet the world unworthy never knew
whose pure idea never tongue exprest
i feel you know the heavens can tell the rest


black pitchy night companion of my woe
the inn of care the nurse of dreary sorrow
why lengthenest thou thy darkest hours so
still to prolong my longtimelookedfor morrow
thou sable shadow image of despair
portrait of hell the airs black mourning weed
recorder of revenge remembrancer of care
the shadow and the veil of every sinful deed
death like to thee so live thou still in death
the grave of joy prison of days delight
let heavens withdraw their sweet ambrosian breath
nor moon nor stars lend thee their shining light
for thou alone renewst that old desire
which still torments me in days burning fire


who list to praise the days delicious light
let him compare it to her heavenly eye
the sunbeams to the lustre of her sight
so may the learned like the simile
the mornings crimson to her lips alike
the sweet of eden to her breaths perfume
the fair elysium to her fairer cheek
unto her veins the only phoenix plume
the angels tresses to her tressd hair
the galaxeia to her more than white
praising the fairest compare it to my fair
still naming her in naming all delight
so may he grace all these in her alone
superlative in all comparison


go you my lines ambassadors of love
with my hearts tribute to her conquering eyes
from whence if you one tear of pity move
for all my woes that only shall suffice
when you minerva in the sun behold
at her perfections stand you then and gaze
where in the compass of a marigold
meridianis sits within a maze
and let invention of her beauty vaunt
when dorus sings his sweet pamelas love
and tell the gods mars is predominant
seated with sol and wears minervas glove
and tell the world that in the world there is
a heaven on earth on earth no heaven but this


many there be excelling in this kind
whose welltricked rhymes with all invention swell
let each commend as best shall like his mind
some sidney constable some daniel
that thus their names familiarly i sing
let none think them disparagd to be
poor men with reverence may speak of a king
and so may these be spoken of by me
my wanton verse neer keeps one certain stay
but now at hand then seeks invention far
and with each little motion runs astray
wild madding jocund and irregular
like me that lust my honest merry rhymes
nor care for critic nor regard the times


eyes with your tears blind if you be
why have these tears such eyes to see
poor eyes if your tears cannot move
my tears eyes then must moan my love
then eyes since you have lost your sight
weep still and tears shall lend you light
till both dissolved and both want might


no no clear eyes you are not blind
but in my tears discern my mind
tears be the language which you speak
which my heart wanting yet must break
my tongue must cease to tell my wrongs
and make my sighs to get them tongues
yet more than this to her belongs


and why not i as hee
thats greatest if as free
in sundry strains that striue
since there so many be
th old _lyrick_ kind reuiue


i will yea and i may
who shall oppose my way
for what is he alone
that of himselfe can say
hees heire of _helicon_


apollo and the nine
forbid no man their shrine
that commeth with hands pure
else be they so diuine
they will not him indure


for they be such coy things
that they care not for kings
and dare let them know it
nor may he touch their springs
that is not borne a poet


the _phocean_ it did proue
whom when foule lust did moue
those mayds vnchast to make
_ fell as with them he stroue
his neck and iustly brake


that instrument ner heard
strooke by the skilfull bard
it strongly to awake
but it th infernalls skard
and made olympus quake


as those prophetike strings
whose sounds with fiery wings
draue fiends from their abode
touchd by the best of kings
that sang the holy ode


so his which women slue
and it int hebrus threw
such sounds yet forth it sent
the bankes to weepe that drue
as downe the streame it went


that by the tortoyse shell
to mayas sonne it fell
the most thereof not doubt
but sure some power did dwell
in him who found it out


the wildest of the field
and ayre with riuers t yeeld
which moud that sturdy glebes
and massie oakes could weeld
to rayse the pyles of _thebes_


and diuersly though strung
so anciently we sung
to it that now scarce knowne
if first it did belong
to _greece_ or if our owne


the _druydes_ imbrewd
with gore on altars rude
with sacrifices crownd
in hollow woods bedewd
adord the trembling sound


though wee be all to seeke
of pindar that great _greeke_
_ to finger it aright
the soule with power to strike
his hand retaynd such might


or him that _rome_ did grace
whose ayres we all imbrace
that scarcely found his peere
nor giueth phoebvs place
for strokes diuinely cleere


the _irish_ i admire
and still cleaue to that lyre
as our musikes mother
and thinke till i expire
apollos such another


as _britons_ that so long
haue held this antike song
and let all our carpers
forbeare their fame to wrong
th are right skilfull harpers


_southerne_ i long thee spare
yet wish thee well to fare
who me pleasedst greatly
as first therefore more rare
handling thy harpe neatly


to those that with despight
shall terme these numbers slight
tell them their iudgements blind
much erring from the right
it is a noble kind


nor is t the verse doth make
that giueth or doth take
tis possible to clyme
to kindle or to slake
although in skeltons ryme


rich statue doublefaced
with marble temples graced
to rayse thy godhead hyer
in flames where altars shining
before thy priests diuining
doe odrous fumes expire


great ianvs i thy pleasure
with all the _thespian_ treasure
doe seriously pursue
to th passed yeere returning
as though the old adiourning
yet bringing in the new


thy ancient vigils yeerely
i haue obserued cleerely
thy feasts yet smoaking bee
since all thy store abroad is
giue something to my goddesse
as hath been vsd by thee


giue her th _eoan_ brightnesse
wingd with that subtill lightnesse
that doth transpierce the ayre
the roses of the morning
the rising heaun adorning
to mesh with flames of hayre


those ceaselesse sounds aboue all
made by those orbes that moue all
and euer swelling there
wrapd vp in numbers flowing
them actually bestowing
for iewels at her eare


o rapture great and holy
doe thou transport me wholly
so well her forme to vary
that i aloft may beare her
whereas i will insphere her
in regions high and starry


and in my choise composures
the soft and easie closures
so amorously shall meet
that euery liuely ceasure
shall tread a perfect measure
set on so equall feet


that spray to fame so fertle
the louercrowning mirtle
in wreaths of mixed bowes
within whose shades are dwelling
those beauties most excelling
inthrond vpon her browes


those paralels so euen
drawne on the face of heauen
that curious art supposes
direct those gems whose cleerenesse
farre off amaze by neerenesse
each globe such fire incloses


her bosome full of blisses
by nature made for kisses
so pure and wondrous cleere
whereas a thousand graces
behold their louely faces
as they are bathing there


o thou selfelittle blindnesse
the kindnesse of vnkindnesse
yet one of those diuine
thy brands to me were leuer
thy _fascia_ and thy quiuer
and thou this quill of mine


this heart so freshly bleeding
vpon it owne selfe feeding
whose woundes still dropping be
o loue thy selfe confounding
her coldnesse so abounding
and yet such heat in me


yet if i be inspired
ile leaue thee so admired
to all that shall succeed
that were they more then many
mongst all there is not any
that time so oft shall read


nor adamant ingraued
that hath been choisely st saued
ideas name outweares
so large a dower as this is
the greatest often misses
the diadem that beares


muse bid the morne awake
sad winter now declines
each bird doth chuse a make
this day s saint valentines
for that good bishops sake
get vp and let vs see
what beautie it shall bee
that fortune vs assignes


but lo in happy howr
the place wherein she lyes
in yonder climbing towr
gilt by the glittring rise
o iove that in a showr
as once that thundrer did
when he in drops lay hid
that i could her surprize


her canopie ile draw
with spangled plumes bedight
no mortall euer saw
so rauishing a sight
that it the gods might awe
and powrfully transpierce
the globie vniuerse
outshooting eury light


my lips ile softly lay
vpon her heaunly cheeke
dyd like the dawning day
as polishd iuorie sleeke
and in her eare ile say
o thou bright morningstarre
tis i that come so farre
my valentine to seeke


each little bird this tyde
doth chuse her loued pheere
which constantly abide
in wedlock all the yeere
as nature is their guide
so may we two be true
this yeere nor change for new
as turtles coupled were


the sparrow swan the doue
though venvs birds they be
yet are they not for loue
so absolute as we
for reason vs doth moue
they but by billing woo
then try what we can doo
to whom each sense is free


which we haue more then they
by liuelyer organs swayd
our appetite each way
more by our sense obayd
our passions to display
this season vs doth fit
then let vs follow it
as nature vs doth lead


one kisse in two lets breake
confounded with the touch
but halfe words let vs speake
our lips imployd so much
vntill we both grow weake
with sweetnesse of thy breath
o smother me to death
long let our ioyes be such


lets laugh at them that chuse
their valentines by lot
to weare their names that vse
whom idly they haue got
such poore choise we refuse
saint valentine befriend
we thus this morne may spend
else muse awake her not


if thus we needs must goe
what shall our one heart doe
this one made of our two


madame two hearts we brake
and from them both did take
the best one heart to make


halfe this is of your heart
mine in the other part
ioynd by our equall art


were it cymented or sowne
by shreds or pieces knowne
we each might find our owne


but tis dissolud and fixd
and with such cunning mixd
no diffrence that betwixt


but how shall we agree
by whom it kept shall be
whether by you or me


it cannot two brests fill
one must be heartlesse still
vntill the other will


it came to me one day
when i willd it to say
with whether it would stay


it told me in your brest
where it might hope to rest
for if it were my ghest


for certainety it knew
that i would still anew
be sending it to you


neuer i thinke had two
such worke so much to doo
a vnitie to woo


yours was so cold and chaste
whilst mine with zeale did waste
like fire with water placd


how did my heart intreat
how pant how did it beat
till it could giue yours heat


till to that temper brought
through our perfection wrought
that blessing eythers thought


in such a height it lyes
from this base worlds dull eyes
that heauen it not enuyes


all that this earth can show
our heart shall not once know
for it too vile and low


priests of apollo sacred be the roome
for this learnd meeting let no barbarous groome
how braue soer he bee
attempt to enter
but of the muses free
none here may venter
this for the _delphian_ prophets is prepard
the prophane vulgar are from hence debard


and since the feast so happily begins
call vp those faire nine with their violins
they are begot by iove
then let vs place them
where no clowne in may shoue
that may disgrace them
but let them neere to young apollo sit
so shall his footpace ouerflow with wit


where be the graces where be those fayre three
in any hand they may not absent bee
they to the gods are deare
and they can humbly
teach vs our selues to beare
and doe things comely
they and the muses rise both from one stem
they grace the muses and the muses them


bring forth your flaggons filld with sparkling wine
whereon swolne bacchvs crowned with a vine
is grauen and fill out
it well bestowing
to eury man about
in goblets flowing
let not a man drinke but in draughts profound
to our god phoebvs let the health goe round


let your iests flye at large yet therewithall
see they be salt but yet not mixd with gall
not tending to disgrace
but fayrely giuen
becomming well the place
modest and euen
that they with tickling pleasure may prouoke
laughter in him on whom the iest is broke


or if the deeds of heroes ye rehearse
let them be sung in so wellordred verse
that each word haue his weight
yet runne with pleasure
holding one stately height
in so braue measure
that they may make the stiffest storme seeme weake
and dampe ioves thunder when it lowdst doth speake


and if yee list to exercise your vayne
or in the sock or in the buskind strayne
let art and nature goe
one with the other
yet so that art may show
nature her mother
the thickbraynd audience liuely to awake
till with shrill claps the theater doe shake


sing hymnes to bacchvs then with hands vpreard
offer to iove who most is to be feard
from him the muse we haue
from him proceedeth
more then we dare to craue
tis he that feedeth
them whom the world would starue then let the lyre
sound whilst his altars endlesse flames expire


maydens why spare ye
or whether not dare ye
correct the blind shooter
because wanton venvs
so oft that doth paine vs
is her sonnes tutor


now in the spring
he proueth his wing
the field is his bower
and as the small bee
about flyeth hee
from flower to flower


and wantonly roues
abroad in the groues
and in the ayre houers
which when it him deweth
his fethers he meweth
in sighes of true louers


and since doomd by fate
that well knew his hate
that hee should be blinde
for very despite
our eyes be his white
so wayward his kinde


if his shafts loosing
ill his mark choosing
or his bow broken
the moane venvs maketh
and care that she taketh
cannot be spoken


to vulcan commending
her loue and straight sending
her doues and her sparrowes
with kisses vnto him
and all but to woo him
to make her sonne arrowes


telling what he hath done
sayth she right mine owne sonne
in her armes she him closes
sweetes on him fans
layd in downe of her swans
his sheets leaues of roses


and feeds him with kisses
which oft when he misses
he euer is froward
the mothers orioying
makes by much coying
the child so vntoward


yet in a fine net
that a spider set
the maydens had caught him
had she not beene neere him
and chanced to heare him
more good they had taught him


most good most faire
or thing as rare
to call yous lost
for all the cost
words can bestow
so poorely show
vpon your prayse
that all the wayes
sense hath come short
whereby report


falls them vnder
that when wonder
more hath seyzed
yet not pleased
that it in kinde
nothing can finde
you to expresse
neuerthelesse
as by globes small
this mightie all


is shewd though farre
from life each starre
a world being
so wee seeing
you like as that
onely trust what
art doth vs teach
and when i reach
at morall things
and that my strings


grauely should strike
straight some mislike
blotteth mine ode
as with the loade
the steele we touch
forced ner so much
yet still remoues
to that it loues


till there it stayes
so to your prayse
i turne euer
and though neuer
from you mouing
happie so louing


wert granted me to choose
how i would end my dayes
since i this life must loose
it should be in your praise
for there is no bayes


can be set aboue you
s impossibly i loue you
and for you sit so hie
whence none may remoue you
in my cleere poesie
that i oft deny
you so ample merit
the freedome of my spirit
maintayning still my cause
your sex not to inherit
vrging the _salique_ lawes
but your vertue drawes


from me euery due
thus still you me pursue
that no where i can dwell
by feare made iust to you
who naturally rebell
of you that excell


that should i still endyte
yet will you want some ryte
that lost in your high praise
i wander to and fro
as seeing sundry waies
yet which the right not know
to get out of this maze


you braue heroique minds
worthy your countries name
that honour still pursue
goe and subdue
whilst loytring hinds
lurke here at home with shame


_britans_ you stay too long
quickly aboard bestow you
and with a merry gale
swell your stretchd sayle
with vowes as strong
as the winds that blow you


your course securely steere
west and by south forth keepe
rocks leeshores nor sholes
when eolvs scowles
you need not feare
so absolute the deepe


and cheerefully at sea
successe you still intice
to get the pearle and gold
and ours to hold
virginia
earths onely paradise


where nature hath in store
fowle venison and fish
and the fruitfullst soyle
without your toyle
three haruests more
all greater then your wish


and the ambitious vine
crownes with his purple masse
the cedar reaching hie
to kisse the sky
the cypresse pine
and vsefull sassafras


to whome the golden age
still natures lawes doth giue
no other cares that tend
but them to defend
from winters rage
that long there doth not liue


when as the lushious smell
of that delicious land
aboue the seas that flowes
the cleere wind throwes
your hearts to swell
approaching the deare strande


in kenning of the shore
thanks to god first giuen
o you the happyst men
be frolike then
let cannons roare
frighting the wide heauen


and in regions farre
such heroes bring yee foorth
as those from whom we came
and plant our name
vnder that starre
not knowne vnto our north


and as there plenty growes
of lawrell euery where
apollos sacred tree
you may it see
a poets browes
to crowne that may sing there


thy voyages attend
industrious hacklvit
whose reading shall inflame
men to seeke fame
and much commend
to aftertimes thy wit


this while we are abroad
shall we not touch our lyre
shall we not sing an ode
shall that holy fire
in vs that strongly glowd
in this cold ayre expire


long since the summer layd
her lustie braurie downe
the autumne halfe is wayd
and boreas gins to frowne
since now i did behold
great brvtes first builded towne


though in the vtmost _peake_
a while we doe remaine
amongst the mountaines bleake
exposd to sleet and raine
no sport our houres shall breake
to exercise our vaine


what though bright phoebvs beames
refresh the southerne ground
and though the princely _thames_
with beautious nymphs abound
and by old _cambers_ streames
be many wonders found


yet many riuers cleare
here glide in siluer swathes
and what of all most deare
_buckstons_ delicious bathes
strong ale and noble cheare
t asswage breeme winters scathes


those grim and horrid caues
whose lookes affright the day
wherein nice nature saues
what she would not bewray
our better leasure craues
and doth inuite our lay


in places farre or neere
or famous or obscure
where wholesome is the ayre
or where the most impure
all times and euerywhere
the muse is still in vre


the ryme nor marres nor makes
nor addeth it nor takes
from that which we propose
things imaginarie
doe so strangely varie
that quickly we them lose


and what s quickly begot
as soone againe is not
this doe i truely know
yea and what s borne with paine
that sense doth longst retaine
gone with a greater flow


yet this critick so sterne
but whom none must discerne
nor perfectly haue seeing
strangely layes about him
as nothing without him
were worthy of being


that i my selfe betray
to that most publique way
where the worlds old bawd
custome that doth humor
and by idle rumor
her dotages applaud


that whilst he still prefers
those that be wholly hers
madnesse and ignorance
i creepe behind the time
from spertling with their crime
and glad too with my chance


o wretched world the while
when the euill most vile
beareth the fayrest face
and inconstant lightnesse
with a scornefull slightnesse
the best things doth disgrace


whilst this strange knowing beast
man of himselfe the least
his enuie declaring
makes vertue to descend
her title to defend
against him much preparing


yet these me not delude
nor from my place extrude
by their resolued hate
their vilenesse that doe know
which to my selfe i show
to keepe aboue my fate


her loud i most
by thee that s lost
though she were wonne with leasure
she was my gaine
but to my paine
thou spoylst me of my treasure


the ship full fraught
with gold farre sought
though ner so wisely helmed
may suffer wracke
in sayling backe
by tempest ouerwhelmed


but shee good sir
did not preferre
you for that i was ranging
but for that shee
found faith in mee
and she loud to be changing


therefore boast not
your happy lot
be silent now you haue her
the time i knew
she slighted you
when i was in her fauour


none stands so fast
but may be cast
by fortune and disgraced
once did i weare
her garter there
where you her gloue haue placed


i had the vow
that thou hast now
and glances to discouer
her loue to mee
and she to thee
reades but old lessons ouer


she hath no smile
that can beguile
but as my thought i know it
yea to a hayre
both when and where
and how she will bestow it


what now is thine
was onely mine
and first to me was giuen
thou laughst at mee
i laugh at thee
and thus we two are euen


but ile not mourne
but stay my turne
the wind may come about sir
and once againe
may bring me in
and help to beare you out sir


the muse should be sprightly
yet not handling lightly
things graue as much loath
things that be slight to cloath
curiously to retayne
the comelinesse in meane
is true knowledge and wit
not me forcd rage doth fit
that i thereto should lacke
tabacco or need sacke


which to the colder braine
is the true _hyppocrene_
nor did i euer care
for great fooles nor them spare
vertue though neglected
is not so deiected
as vilely to descend
to low basenesse their end
neyther each ryming slaue
deserues the name to haue
of poet so the rabble
of fooles for the table
that haue their iests by heart
as an actor his part


might assume them chayres
amongst the muses heyres
_parnassus_ is not clome
by euery such mome
vp whose steep side who swerues
it behoues t haue strong nerues
my resolution such
how well and not how much
to write thus doe i fare
like some few good that care
the euill sort among
how well to liue and not how long


good folke for gold or hyre
but helpe me to a cryer
for my poore heart is runne astray
after two eyes that passd this way


if there be any man
in towne or countrey can
bring me my heart againe
ile please him for his paine
and by these marks i will you show
that onely i this heart doe owe
it is a wounded heart
wherein yet sticks the dart


eury piece sore hurt throughout it
faith and troth writ round about it
it was a tame heart and a deare
and neuer vsd to roame
but hauing got this haunt i feare
twill hardly stay at home
for gods sake walking by the way
if you my heart doe see
either impound it for a stray
or send it backe to me


i pray thee leaue loue me no more
call home the heart you gaue me
i but in vaine that saint adore
that can but will not saue me
these poore halfe kisses kill me quite
was euer man thus serued
amidst an ocean of delight
for pleasure to be sterued


shew me no more those snowie brests
with azure riuerets branched
where whilst mine eye with plentie feasts
yet is my thirst not stanched
o tantalvs thy paines ner tell
by me thou art preuented
tis nothing to be plagud in hell
but thus in heauen tormented


clip me no more in those deare armes
nor thy lifes comfort call me
o these are but too powrfull charmes
and doe but more inthrall me
but see how patient i am growne
in all this coyle about thee
come nice thing let my heart alone
i cannot liue without thee


couentry that dost adorne
the countrey wherein i was borne
yet therein lyes not thy prayse
why i should crowne thy towrs with bayes
tis not thy wall me to thee weds
thy ports nor thy proud pyrameds


nor thy trophies of the bore
but that shee which i adore
which scarce goodnesse selfe can payre
first their breathing blest thy ayre
idea in which name i hide
her in my heart deifid
for what good mans mind can see
onely her ideas be
she in whom the vertues came
in womans shape and tooke her name


she so farre past imitation
as but nature our creation
could not alter she had aymed
more then woman to haue framed
she whose truely written story
to thy poore name shall adde more glory
then if it should haue beene thy chance
t haue bred our kings that conquerd _france_
had she beene borne the former age
that house had beene a pilgrimage


and reputed more diuine
then _walsingham_ or beckets shrine
that princesse to whom thou dost owe
thy freedome whose cleere blushing snow
the enuious sunne saw when as she
naked rode to make thee free
was but her type as to foretell
thou shouldst bring forth one should excell
her bounty by whom thou shouldst haue
more honour then she freedome gaue
and that great queene which but of late
ruld this land in peace and state
had not beene but heauen had sworne
a maide should raigne when she was borne


of thy streets which thou holdst best
and most frequent of the rest
happy _michparke_ eury yeere
on the fourth of _august_ there
let thy maides from floras bowers
with their choyce and daintiest flowers
decke thee vp and from their store
with braue garlands crowne that dore
the old man passing by that way
to his sonne in time shall say


there was that lady borne which long
to afterages shall be sung
who vnawares being passed by
back to that house shall cast his eye
speaking my verses as he goes
and with a sigh shut eury close
deare citie trauelling by thee
when thy rising spyres i see
destined her place of birth
yet me thinkes the very earth


hallowed is so farre as i
can thee possibly descry
then thou dwelling in this place
hearing some rude hinde disgrace
thy citie with some scuruy thing
which some iester forth did bring
speake these lines where thou dost come
and strike the slaue for euer dumbe


faire stood the wind for _france_
when we our sayles aduance
nor now to proue our chance
longer will tarry
but putting to the mayne
at _kaux_ the mouth of _sene_
with all his martiall trayne
landed king harry


and taking many a fort
furnishd in warlike sort
marcheth towrds _agincourt_
in happy howre
skirmishing day by day
with those that stopd his way
where the _french_ genrall lay
with all his power


which in his hight of pride
king henry to deride
his ransome to prouide
to the king sending
which he neglects the while
as from a nation vile
yet with an angry smile
their fall portending


and turning to his men
quoth our braue henry then
though they to one be ten
be not amazed
yet haue we well begunne
battels so brauely wonne
haue euer to the sonne
by fame beene raysed


and for my selfe quoth he
this my full rest shall be
_england_ ner mourne for me
nor more esteeme me
victor i will remaine
or on this earth lie slaine
neuer shall shee sustaine
losse to redeeme me


_poiters_ and _cressy_ tell
when most their pride did swell
vnder our swords they fell
no lesse our skill is
than when our grandsire great
clayming the regall seate
by many a warlike feate
lopd the _french_ lillies


the duke of _yorke_ so dread
the eager vaward led
with the maine henry sped
amongst his henchmen
excester had the rere
a brauer man not there
o lord how hot they were
on the false _frenchmen_


they now to fight are gone
armour on armour shone
drumme now to drumme did grone
to heare was wonder
that with the cryes they make
the very earth did shake
trumpet to trumpet spake
thunder to thunder


well it thine age became
o noble erpingham
which didst the signall ayme
to our hid forces
when from a medow by
like a storme suddenly
the _english_ archery
stuck the _french_ horses


with _spanish_ ewgh so strong
arrowes a clothyard long
that like to serpents stung
piercing the weather
none from his fellow starts
but playing manly parts
and like true _english_ hearts
stuck close together


when downe their bowes they threw
and forth their bilbowes drew
and on the french they flew
not one was tardie
armes were from shoulders sent
scalpes to the teeth were rent
downe the _french_ pesants went
our men were hardie


this while our noble king
his broad sword brandishing
downe the _french_ hoast did ding
as to orwhelme it
and many a deepe wound lent
his armes with bloud besprent
and many a cruell dent
bruised his helmet


gloster that duke so good
next of the royall blood
for famous _england_ stood
with his braue brother
clarence in steele so bright
though but a maiden knight
yet in that furious fight
scarce such another


warwick in bloud did wade
oxford the foe inuade
and cruell slaughter made
still as they ran vp
svffolke his axe did ply
beavmont and willovghby
bare them right doughtily
ferrers and fanhope


vpon saint crispins day
fought was this noble fray
which fame did not delay
to _england_ to carry
o when shall _english_ men
with such acts fill a pen
or _england_ breed againe
such a king harry


vppon this sinfull earth
if man can happy be
and higher then his birth
frend take him thus from me


whome promise not deceiues
that he the breach should rue
nor constant reason leaues
opinion to pursue


to rayse his mean estate
that sooths no wantons sinne
doth that preferment hate
that virtue doth not winne


nor brauery doth admire
nor doth more loue professe
to that he doth desire
then that he doth possesse


loose humor nor to please
that neither spares nor spends
but by discretion weyes
what is to needfull ends


to him deseruing not
not yeelding nor doth hould
what is not his doing what
he ought not what he could


whome the base tyrants will
soe much could neuer awe
as him for good or ill
from honesty to drawe


whose constancy doth rise
boue vndeserued spight
whose valewrs to despise
that most doth him delight


that earely leaue doth take
of th world though to his payne
for virtues onely sake
and not till need constrayne


noe man can be so free
though in imperiall seate
nor eminent as he
that deemeth nothing greate


singe wee the rose
then which no flower there growes
is sweeter
and aptly her compare
with what in that is rare
a parallel none meeter


or made poses
of this that incloses
suche blisses
that naturally flusheth
as she blusheth
when she is robd of kisses


or if strewd
when with the morning dewd
or stilling
or howe to sense exposd
all which in her inclosd
ech place with sweetnes filling


that most renownd
by nature richly crownd
with yellow
of that delitious layre
and as pure her hayre
vnto the same the fellowe


fearing of harme
nature that flower doth arme
from danger
the touch giues her offence
but with reuerence
vnto her selfe a stranger


that redde or white
or mixt the sence delyte
behoulding
in her complexion
all which perfection
such harmony infouldinge


that deuyded
ere it was descided
which most pure
began the greeuous war
of _york_ and _lancaster_
that did many yeeres indure


conflicts as greate
as were in all that heate
i sustaine
by her as many harts
as men on either parts
that with her eies hath slaine


the primrose flower
the first of _floras_ bower
is placed
soo is shee first as best
though excellent the rest
all gracing by none graced


that tenyearestrauelld _greeke_ returnd from sea
ner ioyd so much to see his _ithaca_
as i should you who are alone to me
more then wide _greece_ could to that wanderer be
the winter windes still easterly doe keepe
and with keene frosts haue chained vp the deepe


the sunnes to vs a niggard of his rayes
but reuelleth with our _antipodes_
and seldome to vs when he shewes his head
muffled in vapours he straight hies to bed
in those bleake mountaines can you liue where snowe
maketh the vales vp to the hilles to growe
whereas mens breathes doe instantly congeale
and attomd mists turne instantly to hayle
belike you thinke from this more temperate cost
my sighes may haue the power to thawe the frost
which i from hence should swiftly send you thither
yet not so swift as you come slowly hither


how many a time hath _phebe_ from her wayne
with _phoebus_ fires filld vp her hornes againe
shee through her orbe still on her course doth range
but you keep yours still nor for me will change
the sunne that mounted the sterne lions back
shall with the fishes shortly diue the brack
but still you keepe your station which confines
you nor regard him trauelling the signes
those ships which when you went put out to sea
both to our _groenland_ and _virginia_
are now returnd and customd haue their fraught
yet you arriue not nor returne me ought


the thames was not so frozen yet this yeare
as is my bosome with the chilly feare
of your not comming which on me doth light
as on those climes where halfe the world is night
of euery tedious houre you haue made two
all this long winter here by missing you
minutes are months and when the houre is past
a yeare is ended since the clocke strooke last
when your remembrance puts me on the racke
and i should swound to see an _almanacke_


to reade what silent weekes away are slid
since the dire fates you from my sight haue hid
i hate him who the first deuisor was
of this same foolish thing the howerglasse
and of the watch whose dribbling sands and wheele
with their slow stroakes make mee too much to feele
your slackenesse hither o how i doe ban
him that these dialls against walles began


whose snayly motion of the moouing hand
although it goe yet seeme to me to stand
as though at _adam_ it had first set out
and had been stealing all this while about
and when it backe to the first point should come
it shall be then iust at the generall doome
the seas into themselues retract their flowes
the changing winde from euery quarter blowes
declining winter in the spring doth call
the starrs rise to vs as from vs they fall
those birdes we see that leaue vs in the prime
againe in autumne resalute our clime


sure either nature you from kinde hath made
or you delight else to be retrograde
but i perceiue by your attractiue powers
like an inchantresse you haue charmd the bowers
into short minutes and haue drawne them back
so that of vs at _london_ you doe lack
almost a yeare the spring is scarce begonne
there where you liue and autumne almost done
with vs more eastward surely you deuise
by your strong magicke that the sunne shall rise
where now it setts and that in some few yeares
youl alter quite the motion of the spheares


yes and you meane i shall complaine my loue
to grauelld walkes or to a stupid groue
now your companions and that you the while
as you are cruell will sit by and smile
to make me write to these while passers by
sleightly looke in your louely face where i
see beauties heauen whilst silly blockheads they
like laden asses plod vpon their way
and wonder not as you should point a clowne
vp to the _guards_ or _ariadnes_ crowne


of constellations and his dulnesse tell
heed thinke your words were certainly a spell
or him some piece from _creet_ or _marcus_ show
in all his life which till that time ner saw
painting except in alehouse or old hall
done by some druzzler of the prodigall
nay doe stay still whilst time away shall steale
your youth and beautie and your selfe conceale
from me i pray you you haue now inurd
me to your absence and i haue endurd


your want this long whilst i haue starued bine
for your short letters as you helde it sinne
to write to me that to appease my woe
i reade ore those you writ a yeare agoe
which are to me as though they had bin made
long time before the first _olympiad_
for thankes and curtsies sell your presence then
to tatling women and to things like men
and be more foolish then the _indians_ are
for bells for kniues for glasses and such ware
that sell their pearle and gold but here i stay
so i would not haue you but come away


friend if you thinke my papers may supplie
you with some strange omitted noueltie
which others letters yet haue left vntould
you take me off before i can take hould
of you at all i put not thus to sea
for two monthes voyage to _virginia_
with newes which now a little something here
but will be nothing ere it can come there
i feare as i doe stabbing this word state
i dare not speake of the _palatinate_
although some men make it their hourely theame
and talke whats done in _austria_ and in _beame_
i may not so what _spinola_ intends
nor with his _dutch_ which way prince _maurice_ bends


to other men although these things be free
yet george they must be misteries to mee
i scarce dare praise a vertuous friend thats dead
lest for my lines he should be censured
it was my hap before all other men
to suffer shipwrack by my forward pen
when king iames entred at which ioyfull time
i taught his title to this ile in rime
and to my part did all the muses win
with highpitch _pæans_ to applaud him in
when cowardise had tyed vp euery tongue
and all stood silent yet for him i sung
and when before by danger i was dard
i kickd her from me nor a iot i spard
yet had not my cleere spirit in fortunes scorne
me aboue earth and her afflictions borne


he next my god on whom i built my trust
had left me troden lower then the dust
but let this passe in the extreamest ill
_apollos_ brood must be couragious still
let pies and dawes sit dumb before their death
onely the swan sings at the parting breath
and worthy george by industry and vse
lets see what lines _virginia_ will produce
goe on with ovid as you haue begunne
with the first fiue bookes let your numbers run
glib as the former so shall it liue long
and doe much honour to the _english_ tongue


intice the muses thither to repaire
intreat them gently trayne them to that ayre
for they from hence may thither hap to fly
twards the sad time which but to fast doth hie
for poesie is followd with such spight
by groueling drones that neuer raught her height
that she must hence she may no longer staye
the driery fates prefixed haue the day
of her departure which is now come on
and they command her straight wayes to be gon
that bestiall heard so hotly her pursue
and to her succour there be very few


nay none at all her wrongs that will redresse
but she must wander in the wildernesse
like to the woman which that holy iohn
beheld in _pathmos_ in his vision
as th _english_ now so did the stiffneckt _iewes_
their noble prophets vtterly refuse
and of these men such poore opinions had
they counted _esay_ and _ezechiel_ mad
when _ieremy_ his lamentations writ
they thought the wizard quite out of his wit
such sots they were as worthily to ly
lockt in the chaines of their captiuity


knowledge hath still her eddy in her flow
so it hath beene and it will still be so
that famous _greece_ where learning flourisht most
hath of her muses long since left to boast
th vnlettered _turke_ and rude _barbarian_ trades
where homer sang his lofty _iliads_
and this vaste volume of the world hath taught
much may to passe in little time be brought
as if to _symptoms_ we may credit giue
this very time wherein we two now liue
shall in the compasse wound the muses more
then all the old _english_ ignorance before
base balatry is so beloud and sought
and those braue numbers are put by for naught


which rarely read were able to awake
bodyes from graues and to the ground to shake
the wandring clouds and to our men at armes
gainst pikes and muskets were most powerfull charmes
that but i know insuing ages shall
raise her againe who now is in her fall
and out of dust reduce our scattered rimes
th reiected iewels of these slothfull times
who with the muses would misspend an hower
but let blind gothish barbarisme deuoure


these feuerous dogdays blest by no record
but to be euerlastingly abhord
if you vouchsafe rescription stuffe your quill
with naturall bountyes and impart your skill
in the description of the place that i
may become learned in the soyle thereby
of noble _wyats_ health and let me heare
the gouernour and how our people there


increase and labour what supplyes are sent
which i confesse shall giue me much content
but you may saue your labour if you please
to write to me ought of your sauages
as sauage slaues be in great _britaine_ here
as any one that you can shew me there
and though for this ile say i doe not thirst
yet i should like it well to be the first
whose numbers hence into _virginia_ flew
so noble _sandis_ for this time adue


deare friend be silent and with patience see
what this mad times catastrophe will be
the worlds first wisemen certainly mistooke
themselues and spoke things quite beside the booke


and that which they haue of said of god vntrue
or else expect strange iudgement to insue
this isle is a meere bedlam and therein
we all lye rauing mad in euery sinne
and him the wisest most men use to call
who doth alone the maddest thing of all
he whom the master of all wisedome found
for a marckt foole and so did him propound
the time we liue in to that passe is brought
that only he a censor now is thought
and that base villaine not an age yet gone
which a good man would not haue lookd vpon


now like a god with diuine worship followd
and all his actions are accounted hollowd
this world of ours thus runneth vpon wheeles
set on the head bolt vpright with her heeles
which makes me thinke of what the _ethnicks_ told
th opinion the pythagorists vphold


that the immortall soule doth transmigrate
then i suppose by the strong power of fate


through fools and beasts and lunatiques haue past
are heere imbodyed in this age at last
and though so long we from that time be gone
yet taste we still of that confusion
for certainely theres scarse one found that now
knowes what t approoue or what to disallow
all arsey varsey nothing is its owne
but to our prouerbe all turnd vpside downe


to doe in time is to doe out of season
and that speeds best thats done the farthst from reason
hee s highst that s lowst hee s surest in that s out
he hits the next way that goes farthst about
he getteth vp vnlike to rise at all
he slips to ground as much vnlike to fall
which doth inforce me partly to prefer
the opinion of that mad philosopher
who taught that those allframing powers aboue
as tis supposd made man not out of loue
to him at all but only as a thing
to make them sport with which they vse to bring


as men doe munkeys puppets and such tooles
of laughter so men are but the gods fooles
such are by titles lifted to the sky
as wherefore no man knowes god scarcely why
the vertuous man depressed like a stone
for that dull sot to raise himselfe vpon
he who nere thing yet worthy man durst doe
neuer durst looke vpon his countreys foe
nor durst attempt that action which might get
him fame with men or higher might him set


then the base begger rightly if compard
this drone yet neuer braue attempt that dard
yet dares be knighted and from thence dares grow
to any title empire can bestow
for this beleeue that impudence is now
a cardinall vertue and men it allow
reuerence nay more men study and inuent
new wayes nay glory to be impudent


into the clouds the deuill lately got
and by the moisture doubting much the rot
a medicine tooke to make him purge and cast
which in short time began to worke so fast
that he fell too t and from his backeside flew
a rout of rascall a rude ribauld crew
of base plebeians which no sooner light
vpon the earth but with a suddaine flight
they spread this ile and as _deucalion_ once
ouer his shoulder backe by throwing stones


they became men euen so these beasts became
owners of titles from an obscure name
he that by riot of a mighty rent
hath his late goodly patrimony spent
and into base and wilfull beggery run
this man as he some glorious acte had done
with some great pension or rich guift releeud
when he that hath by industry atchieud
some noble thing contemned and disgracd
in the forlorne hope of the times is placd
as though that god had carelessely left all
that being hath on this terrestriall ball


to fortunes guiding nor would haue to doe
with man nor aught that doth belong him to
or at the least god hauing giuen more
power to the deuill then he did of yore
ouer this world the feind as he doth hate
the vertuous man maligning his estate
all noble things and would haue by his will
to be damnd with him vsing all his skill
by his blacke hellish ministers to vexe
all worthy men and strangely to perplexe


their constancie there by them so to fright
that they should yeeld them wholely to his might
but of these things i vainely doe but tell
where hell is heauen and heaun is now turnd hell
where that which lately blasphemy hath bin
now godlinesse much lesse accounted sin
and a long while i greatly meruaild why
buffoons and bawdes should hourely multiply
till that of late i construed it that they
to present thrift had got the perfect way


when i concluded by their odious crimes
it was for vs no thriuing in these times
as men oft laugh at little babes when they
hap to behold some strange thing in their play
to see them on the suddaine strucken sad
as in their fancie some strange formes they had
which they by pointing with their fingers showe
angry at our capacities so slowe


that by their countenance we no sooner learne
to see the wonder which they so discerne
so the celestiall powers doe sit and smile
at innocent and vertuous men the while
they stand amazed at the world oregone
so farre beyond imagination
with slauish basenesse that the silent sit
pointing like children in describing it


then noble friend the next way to controule
these worldly crosses is to arme thy soule
with constant patience and with thoughts as high
as these be lowe and poore winged to flye
to that exalted stand whether yet they
are got with paine that sit out of the way
of this ignoble age which raiseth none
but such as thinke their black damnation
to be a trifle such so ill that when
they are aduancd those few poore honest men
that yet are liuing into search doe runne
to finde what mischiefe they haue lately done
which so preferres them say thou he doth rise
that maketh vertue his chiefe exercise
and in this base world come what euer shall
hees worth lamenting that for her doth fall


light sonnets hence and to loose louers flie
and mournfull maydens sing an elegie
on those three sheffields ouerwhelmd with waues
whose losse the teares of all the muses craues
a thing so full of pitty as this was
me thinkes for nothing should not slightly passe
treble this losse was why should it not borrowe
through this iles treble parts a treble sorrowe
but fate did this to let the world to knowe
that sorrowes which from common causes growe
are not worth mourning for the losse to beare
but of one onely sonne s not worth one teare


some tenderhearted man as i may spend
some drops perhaps for a deceased friend
some men perhaps their wifes late death may rue
or wifes their husbands but such be but fewe
cares that haue vsd the hearts of men to tuch
so oft and deepely will not now be such
wholl care for loss of maintenance or place
fame liberty or of the princes grace
or sutes in law by base corruption crost
when he shall finde that this which he hath lost
alas is nothing to his which did lose
three sonnes at once so excellent as those


nay it is feard that this in time may breed
hard hearts in men to their owne naturall seed
that in respect of this great losse of theirs
men will scarce mourne the death of their owne heires
through all this ile their losse so publique is
that euery man doth take them to be his
and as a plague which had beginning there
so catching is and raigning euery where
that those the farthest off as much doe rue them
as those the most familiarly that knew them
children with this disaster are wext sage
and like to men that strucken are in age


talke what it is three children at one time
thus to haue drownd and in their very prime
yea and doe learne to act the same so well
that then olde folke they better can it tell
inuention oft that passion vsd to faine
in sorrowes of themselves but slight and meane
to make them seeme great here it shall not need
for that this subiect doth so farre exceed
all forcd expression that what poesie shall
happily thinke to grace it selfe withall
falls so belowe it that it rather borrowes
grace from their griefe then addeth to their sorrowes


for sad mischance thus in the losse of three
to shewe it selfe the vtmost it could bee
exacting also by the selfe same lawe
the vtmost teares that sorrowe had to drawe
all future times hath vtterly preuented
of a more losse or more to be lamented
whilst in faire youth they liuely flourishd here
to their kinde parents they were onely deere
but being dead now euery one doth take
them for their owne and doe like sorrowe make
as for their owne begot as they pretended
hope in the issue which should haue discended
from them againe nor here doth end our sorrow
but those of vs that shall be borne to morrowe


still shall lament them and when time shall count
to what vast number passed yeares shall mount
they from their death shall duly reckon so
as from the deluge former vsd to doe
o cruell _humber_ guilty of their gore
i now beleeue more then i did before
the _brittish_ story whence thy name begun
of kingly _humber_ an inuading _hun_
by thee deuoured fort is likely thou
with blood wert christned bloudthirsty till now


the _ouse_ the _done_ and thou farre clearer _trent_
to drowne the sheffields as you gaue consent
shall curse the time that ere you were infusd
which haue your waters basely thus abusd
the groueling boore yee hinder not to goe
and at his pleasure ferry to and fro
the very best part of whose soule and bloud
compared with theirs is viler then your mud


but wherefore paper doe i idely spend
on those deafe waters to so little end
and vp to starry heauen doe i not looke
in which as in an euerlasting booke
our ends are written o let times rehearse
their fatall losse in their sad aniuerse


madame to shew the smoothnesse of my vaine
neither that i would haue you entertaine
the time in reading me which you would spend
in faire discourse with some knowne honest friend
i write not to you nay and which is more
my powerfull verses striue not to restore
what time and sicknesse haue in you impaird
to other ends my elegie is squard


your beauty sweetnesse and your gracefull parts
that haue drawne many eyes wonne many hearts
of me get little i am so much man
that let them doe their vtmost that they can
i will resist their forces and they be
though great to others yet not so to me
the first time i beheld you i then sawe
that in it selfe which had the power to drawe
my stayd affection and thought to allowe
you some deale of my heart but you have now
got farre into it and you haue the skill
for ought i see to winne vpon me still


when i doe thinke how brauely you haue borne
your many crosses as in fortunes scorne
and how neglectfull you have seemd to be
of that which hath seemd terrible to me
i thought you stupid nor that you had felt
those griefes which often i haue scene to melt
another woman into sighes and teares
a thing but seldome in your sexe and yeares


but when in you i haue perceiud agen
noted by me more then by other men
how feeling and how sensible you are
of your friends sorrowes and with how much care
you seeke to cure them then my selfe i blame
that i your patience should so much misname
which to my vnderstanding maketh knowne
who feeles anothers griefe can feele their owne
when straight me thinkes i heare your patience say
are you the man that studied _seneca_
_plinies_ most learned letters and must i
read you a lecture in philosophie


tauoid the afflictions that haue vsd to reach you
ile learne you more sir then your bookes can teach you
of all your sex yet neuer did i knowe
any that yet so actually could showe
such rules for patience such an easie way
that who so sees it shall be forcd to say
loe what before seemd hard to be discernd
is of this lady in an instant learnd
it is heauens will that you should wronged be
by the malicious that the world might see
your douelike meekenesse for had the base scumme
the spawne of fiends beene in your slander dumbe


your vertue then had perishd neuer prizd
for that the same you had not exercised
and you had lost the crowne you haue and glory
nor had you beene the subiect of my story
whilst they feele hell being damned in their hate
their thoughts like deuils them excruciate
which by your noble suffrings doe torment
them with new paines and giues you this content
to see your soule an innocent hath suffred
and vp to heauen before your eyes be offred
your like we in a burning glasse may see
when the sunnes rayes therein contracted be
bent on some obiect which is purely white
we finde that colour doth dispierce the light


and stands vntainted but if it hath got
some little sully or the least small spot
then it soon fiers it so you still remaine
free because in you they can finde no staine
god doth not loue them least on whom he layes
the greatst afflictions but that he will praise
himselfe most in them and will make them fit
nearst to himselfe who is the lambe to sit
for by that touch like perfect gold he tries them
who are not his vntill the world denies them


and your example may work such effect
that it may be the beginning of a sect
of patient women and that many a day
all husbands may for you their founder pray
nor is to me your innocence the lesse
in that i see you striue not to suppresse
their barbarous malice but your noble heart
prepard to act so difficult a part
with vnremoued constancie is still
the same it was that of your proper ill


the effect proceeds from your owne selfe the cause
like some iust prince who to establish lawes
suffers the breach at his best loud to strike
to learne the vulgar to endure the like
you are a martir thus nor can you be
lesse to the world so valued by me
if as you haue begun you still perseuer
be euer good that i may loue you euer


must i needes write whos hee that can refuse
he wants a minde for her that hath no muse
the thought of her doth heaunly rage inspire
next powerfull to those clouen tongues of fire
since i knew ought time neuer did allowe
me stuffe fit for an elegie till now
when _france_ and _englands_ henries dyd my quill
why i know not but it that time lay still
tis more then greatnesse that my spirit must raise
to obserue custome i vse not to praise
nor the least thought of mine yet ere depended
on any one from whom she was descended
that for their fauour i this way should wooe
as some poor wretched things perhaps may doe


i gaine the end whereat i onely ayme
if by my freedome i may giue her fame
walking then forth being newly vp from bed
o sir quoth one the lady cliftons dead
when but that reason my sterne rage withstood
my hand had sure beene guilty of his blood
if shee be so must thy rude tongue confesse it
quoth i and comst so coldly to expresse it
thou shouldst haue giuen a shreeke to make me feare thee
that might haue slaine what euer had beene neere thee
thou shouldst haue comn like time with thy scalpe bare
and in thy hands thou shouldst haue brought thy haire


casting vpon me such a dreadfull looke
as seene a spirit or thadst beene thunderstrooke
and gazing on me so a little space
thou shouldst haue shot thine eye balls in my face
then falling at my feet thou shouldst haue said
o she is gone and nature with her dead
with this ill newes amazd by chance i past
by that neere groue whereas both first and last
i saw her not three moneths before shee did
when though full summer gan to vaile her pride
and that i sawe men leade home ripened corne
besides aduisd me well i durst haue sworne


the lingring yeare the autumne had adiournd
and the fresh spring had beene againe returnd
her delicacie louelinesse and grace
with such a summer brauery deckt the place
but now alas it lookt forlorne and dead
and where she stood the fading leaues were shed
presenting onely sorrowe to my sight
o god thought i this is her embleme right
and sure i thinke it cannot but be thought
that i to her by prouidence was brought
for that the fates foredooming shee should die
shewed me this wondrous master peece that i
should sing her funerall that the world should know it
that heauen did thinke her worthy of a poet


my hand is fatall nor doth fortune doubt
for what it writes not fire shall ere race out
a thousand silken puppets should haue died
and in their fulsome coffins putrified
ere in my lines you of their names should heare
to tell the world that such there euer were
whose memory shall from the earth decay
before those rags be worne they gaue away
had i her godlike features neuer seene
poore slight report had tolde me she had beene
a hansome lady comely very well
and so might i haue died an infidell


as many doe which neuer did her see
or cannot credit what she was by mee
nature her selfe that before art prefers
to goe beyond all our cosmographers
by charts and maps exactly that haue showne
all of this earth that euer can be knowne
for that she would beyond them all descrie
what art could not by any mortall eye
a map of heauen in her rare features drue
and that she did so liuely and so true
that any soule but seeing it might sweare
that all was perfect heauenly that was there


if euer any painter were so blest
to drawe that face which so much heaun exprest
if in his best of skill he did her right
i wish it neuer may come in my sight
i greatly doubt my faith weake man lest i
should to that face commit idolatry
death might haue tythd her sex but for this one
nay haue tan halfe to haue let her alone
such as their wrinkled temples to supply
cyment them vp with sluttish _mercury_


such as vndrest were able to affright
a valiant man approching him by night
death might haue taken such her end deferd
vntill the time she had beene climaterd
when she would haue bin at threescore yeares and three
such as our best at three and twenty be
with enuie then he might haue ouerthrowne her
when age nor time had power to ceaze vpon her
but when the vnpittying fates her end decreed
they to the same did instantly proceed
for well they knew if she had languishd so
as those which hence by naturall causes goe


so many prayers and teares for her had spoken
as certainly their iron lawes had broken
and had wakd heaun who clearely would haue showd
that change of kingdomes to her death it owd
and that the world still of her end might thinke
it would haue let some neighbouring mountaine sinke
or the vast sea it in on vs to cast
as _seuerne_ did about some fiue yeares past
or some sterne comet his curld top to reare
whose length should measure halfe our hemisphere


holding this height to say some will not sticke
that now i raue and am growne lunatique
you of what sexe so ere you be you lye
tis thou thy selfe is lunatique not i
i charge you in her name that now is gone
that may coniure you if you be not stone
that you no harsh nor shallow rimes decline
vpon that day wherein you shall read mine


such as indeed are falsely termed verse
and will but sit like mothes vpon her herse
nor that no child nor chambermaide nor page
disturbe the rome the whilst my sacred rage
in reading is but whilst you heare it read
suppose before you that you see her dead
the walls about you hung with mournfull blacke
and nothing of her funerall to lacke
and when this period giues you leaue to pause
cast vp your eyes and sigh for my applause


i many a time haue greatly marueild why
men say their friends depart when as they die
how well that word a dying doth expresse
i did not know i freely must confesse
till her departure for whose missed sight
i am enforcd this elegy to write
but since resistlesse fate will haue it so
that she from hence must to _iberia_ goe
and my weak wishes can her not detaine
i will of heauen in policy complaine
that it so long her trauell should adiourne
hoping thereby to hasten her returne


can those of _norway_ for their wage procure
by their blacke spells a winde that shall endure
till from aboard the wished land men see
and fetch the harbour where they long to be
can they by charmes doe this and cannot i
who am the priest of _phoebus_ and so hie
sit in his fauour winne the poets god
to send swift _hermes_ with his snaky rod
to _æolus_ caue commanding him with care
his prosperous winds that he for her prepare
and from that howre wherein shee takes the seas
nature bring on the quiet _halcion_ dayes
and in that hower that bird begin her nest
nay at that very instant that long rest


may seize on _neptune_ who may still repose
and let that bird nere till that hower disclose
wherein she landeth and for all that space
be not a wrinkle seene on _thetis_ face
onely so much breath with a gentle gale
as by the easy swelling of her saile
may at _sebastians_ safely set her downe
where with her goodnes she may blesse the towne
if heauen in iustice would haue plagud by thee
some pirate and grimme _neptune_ thou shouldst be
his executioner or what is his worse
the gripple merchant borne to be the curse


of this braue iland let them for her sake
who to thy safeguard doth her selfe betake
escape vndrownd vnwrackt nay rather let
them be at ease in some safe harbour set
where with much profit they may vent their wealth
that they haue got by villany and stealth
rather great _neptune_ then when thou dost raue
thou once shouldst wet her saile but with a waue
or if some proling rouer shall but dare
to seize the ship wherein she is to fare
let the fell fishes of the maine appeare
and tell those seathiefes that once such they were


as they are now till they assaid to rape
grapecrowned _bacchus_ in a striplings shape
that came aboard them and would faine haue saild
to vinespread _naxus_ but that him they faild
which he perceiuing them so monstrous made
and warnd them how they passengers inuade
ye south and westerne winds now cease to blow
autumne is come there be no flowers to grow
yea from that place respire to which she goes
and to her sailes should show your selfe but foes


but _boreas_ and yee esterne windes arise
to send her soon to _spaine_ but be precise
that in your aide you seeme not still so sterne
as we a summer should no more discerne
for till that here againe i may her see
it will be winter all the yeare with mee
ye swannebegotten lonely brotherstars
so oft auspicious to poore mariners
ye twinbred lights of louely _ledas_ brood
_ioues_ eggeborne issue smile vpon the flood
and in your mildst aspect doe ye appeare
to be her warrant from all future feare


and if thou ship that bearst her doe proue good
may neuer time by wormes consume thy wood
nor rust thy iron may thy tacklings last
till they for reliques be in temples plact
maist thou be ranged with that mighty arke
wherein iust _noah_ did all the world imbarque
with that which after _troyes_ so famous wracke
from ten yeares trauell brought _vlisses_ backe
that argo which to _colchos_ went from _greece_
and in her botome brought the goulden fleece


vnder braue _iason_ or that same of _drake_
wherein he did his famous voyage make
about the world or _candishes_ that went
as far as his about the continent
and yee milde winds that now i doe implore
not once to raise the least sand on the shore
nor once on forfait of your selues respire
when once the time is come of her retire
if then it please you but to doe your due
what for these windes i did ile doe for you


ile wooe you then and if that not suffice
my pen shall prooue you to haue dietyes
ile sing your loues in verses that shall flow
and tell the storyes of your weale and woe
ile prooue what profit to the earth you bring
and how tis you that welcome in the spring
ile raise vp altars to you as to show
the time shall be kept holy when you blow
o blessed winds your will that it may be
to send health to her and her home to me


my dearely loued friend how oft haue we
in winter evenings meaning to be free
to some wellchosen place vsd to retire
and there with moderate meate and wine and fire
haue past the howres contentedly with chat
now talk of this and then discoursd of that
spoke our owne verses twixt our selves if not
other mens lines which we by chance had got
or some stage pieces famous long before
of which your happy memory had store
and i remember you much pleased were
of those who liued long agoe to heare


as well as of those of these latter times
who have inricht our language with their rimes
and in succession how still vp they grew
which is the subiect that i now pursue
for from my cradle you must know that i
was still inclind to noble poesie
and when that once _pueriles_ i had read
and newly had my _cato_ construed
in my small selfe i greatly marueild then
amonst all other what strange kinde of men
these poets were and pleased with the name
to my milde tutor merrily i came


for i was then a proper goodly page
much like a pigmy scarse ten yeares of age
clasping my slender armes about his thigh
o my deare master cannot you quoth i
make me a poet doe it if you can
and you shall see ile quickly bee a man
who me thus answered smiling boy quoth he
if youle not play the wag but i may see
you ply your learning i will shortly read
some poets to you _phoebus_ be my speed
toot hard went i when shortly he began
and first read to me honest _mantuan_


then _virgils eglogues_ being entred thus
me thought i straight had mounted _pegasus_
and in his full careere could make him stop
and bound vpon _parnassus_ byclift top
i scornd your ballet then though it were done
and had for finis _william elderton_
but soft in sporting with this childish iest
i from my subiect haue too long digrest


then to the matter that we tooke in hand
_ioue_ and _apollo_ for the _muses_ stand
then noble _chaucer_ in those former times
the first inrichd our _english_ with his rimes
and was the first of ours that euer brake
into the _muses_ treasure and first spake
in weighty numbers deluing in the mine
of perfect knowledge which he could refine
and coyne for currant and as much as then
the _english_ language could expresse to men
he made it doe and by his wondrous skill
gaue vs much light from his abundant quill


and honest _gower_ who in respect of him
had only sipt at _aganippas_ brimme
and though in yeares this last was him before
yet fell he far short of the others store
when after those foure ages very neare
they with the _muses_ which conuersed were
that princely _surrey_ early in the time
of the eight _henry_ who was then the prime
of _englands_ noble youth with him there came
_wyat_ with reuerence whom we still doe name


amongst our poets _brian_ had a share
with the two former which accompted are
that times best makers and the authors were
of those small poems which the title beare
of songs and sonnets wherein oft they hit
on many dainty passages of wit
_gascoine_ and _churchyard_ after them againe
in the beginning of _elizas_ raine
accoumpted were great meterers many a day
but not inspired with braue fier had they
liud but a little longer they had seene
their works before them to have buried beene
graue morrall _spencer_ after these came on
then whom i am perswaded there was none


since the blind _bard_ his _iliads_ vp did make
fitter a taske like that to vndertake
to set downe boldly brauely to inuent
in all high knowledge surely excellent
the noble _sidney_ with this last arose
that _heroe_ for numbers and for prose
that throughly pacd our language as to show
the plenteous _english_ hand in hand might goe
with _greek_ or _latine_ and did first reduce
our tongue from _lillies_ writing then in vse
talking of stones stars plants of fishes flyes
playing with words and idle similies


as th _english_ apes and very zanies be
of euery thing that they doe heare and see
so imitating his ridiculous tricks
they spake and writ all like meere lunatiques
then _warner_ though his lines were not so trimd
nor yet his poem so exactly limd
and neatly ioynted but the criticke may
easily reprooue him yet thus let me say
for my old friend some passages there be
in him which i protest haue taken me
with almost wonder so fine cleere and new
as yet they haue bin equalled by few


neat _marlow_ bathed in the _thespian_ springs
had in him those braue translunary things
that the first poets had his raptures were
all ayre and fire which made his verses cleere
for that fine madnes still he did retaine
which rightly should possesse a poets braine
and surely _nashe_ though he a proser were
a branch of lawrell yet deserues to beare
sharply _satirick_ was he and that way
he went since that his being to this day


few haue attempted and i surely thinke
those wordes shall hardly be set downe with inke
shall scorch and blast so as his could where he
would inflict vengeance and be it said of thee
_shakespeare_ thou hadst as smooth a comicke vaine
fitting the socke and in thy naturall braine
as strong conception and as cleere a rage
as any one that trafiqud with the stage
amongst these _samuel daniel_ whom if i
may spake of but to sensure doe denie


onely haue heard some wisemen him rehearse
to be too much _historian_ in verse
his rimes were smooth his meeters well did close
but yet his maner better fitted prose
next these learnd _johnson_ in this list i bring
who had drunke deepe of the _pierian_ spring
whose knowledge did him worthily prefer
and long was lord here of the theater
who in opinion made our learnst to sticke
whether in poems rightly dramatique


strong _seneca_ or _plautus_ he or they
should beare the buskin or the socke away
others againe here liued in my dayes
that haue of vs deserued no lesse praise
for their translations then the daintiest wit
that on _parnassus_ thinks he highst doth sit
and for a chaire may mongst the muses call
as the most curious maker of them all
as reuerent _chapman_ who hath brought to vs
_musæus_ _homer_ and _hesiodus_
out of the greeke and by his skill hath reard
them to that height and to our tongue endeard
that were those poets at this day aliue
to see their bookes thus with vs to suruiue


they would think hauing neglected them so long
they had bin written in the _english_ tongue
and _siluester_ who from the _french_ more weake
made _bartas_ of his sixe dayes labour speake
in naturall _english_ who had he there stayd
he had done well and neuer had bewraid
his owne inuention to haue bin so poore
who still wrote lesse in striuing to write more
then dainty _sands_ that hath to _english_ done
smooth sliding _ouid_ and hath made him run
with so much sweetnesse and vnusuall grace
as though the neatnesse of the _english_ pace


should tell the ietting _lattine_ that it came
but slowly after as though stiff and lame
so _scotland_ sent vs hither for our owne
that man whose name i euer would haue knowne
to stand by mine that most ingenious knight
my _alexander_ to whom in his right
i want extreamely yet in speaking thus
i doe but shew the loue that was twixt vs
and not his numbers which were braue and hie
so like his mind was his clear poesie
and my deare _drummond_ to whom much i owe
for his much loue and proud i was to know
his poesie for which two worthy men
i _menstry_ still shall loue and _hauthorneden_


then the two _beamounts_ and my _browne_ arose
my deare companions whom i freely chose
my bosome friends and in their seuerall wayes
rightly borne poets and in these last dayes
men of much note and no lesse nobler parts
such as haue freely tould to me their hearts
as i have mine to them but if you shall
say in your knowledge that these be not all
haue writ in numbers be informd that i
only my selfe to these few men doe tye
whose works oft printed set on euery post
to publique censure subiect haue bin most


for such whose poems be they nere so rare
in priuate chambers that incloistered are
and by transcription daintyly must goe
as though the world vnworthy were to know
their rich composures let those men that keepe
these wonderous reliques in their iudgement deepe
and cry them vp so let such peeces bee
spoke of by those that shall come after me


i passe not for them nor doe meane to run
in quest of these that them applause haue wonne
vpon our stages in these latter dayes
that are so many let them haue their bayes
that doe deserue it let those wits that haunt
those publique circuits let them freely chaunt
their fine composures and their praise pursue
and so my deare friend for this time adue


could there be words found to expresse my losse
there were some hope that this my heauy crosse
might be sustained and that wretched i
might once finde comfort but to haue him die
past all degrees that was so deare to me
as but comparing him with others hee
was such a thing as if some power should say
ile take man on me to shew men the way
what a friend should be but words come so short
of him that when i thus would him report
i am vndone and hauing nought to say
mad at my selfe i throwe my penne away


and beate my breast that there should be a woe
so high that words cannot attaine thereto
tis strange that i from my abundant breast
who others sorrowes haue so well exprest
yet i by this in little time am growne
so poore that i want to expresse mine owne
i thinke the fates perceiuing me to beare
my worldly crosses without wit or feare


nay with what scorne i euer haue derided
those plagues that for me they haue oft prouided
drew them to counsaile nay conspired rather
and in this businesse laid their heads together
to finde some one plague that might me subuert
and at an instant breake my stubborne heart
they did indeede and onely to this end
they tooke from me this more then man or friend
hardhearted fates your worst thus haue you done
then let vs see what lastly you haue wonne


by this your rigour in a course so strict
why see i beare all that you can inflict
and hee from heauen your poore reuenge to view
laments my losse of him but laughes at you
whilst i against you execrations breath
thus are you scornd aboue and curst beneath
me thinks that man vnhappy though he be
is now thrice happy in respect of me
who hath no friend for that in hauing none
he is not stirrd as i am to bemone


my miserable losse who but in vaine
may euer looke to find the like againe
this more then mine own selfe that who had seene
his care of me where euer i had beene
and had not knowne his actiue spirit before
vpon some braue thing working euermore
he would haue sworne that to no other end
he had been borne but onely for my friend
i had been happy if nice nature had
since now my lucke falls out to be so bad
made me vnperfect either of so soft
and yeelding temper that lamenting oft


i into teares my mournefull selfe might melt
or else so dull my losse not to haue felt
i haue by my too deare experience bought
that fooles and mad men whom i euer thought
the most vnhappy are in deede not so
and therefore i lesse pittie can bestowe
since that my sence my sorrowe so can sound
on those in bedlam that are bound
and scarce feele scourging and when as i meete
a foole by children followed in the streete
thinke i poor wretch thou from my griefe art free
nor couldst thou feele it should it light on thee
but that i am a _christian_ and am taught
by him who with his precious bloud me bought


meekly like him my crosses to endure
else would they please me well that for their cure
when as they feele their conscience doth them brand
vpon themselues dare lay a violent hand
not suffering fortune with her murdering knife
stand like a surgeon working on the life
deserting this part that ioynt off to cut
shewing that artire ripping then that gut
whilst the dull beastly world with her squint eye
is to behold the strange anatomie


i am persuaded that those which we read
to be manhaters were not so indeed
the athenian _timon_ and beside him more
of which the _latines_ as the _greekes_ haue store
nor not did they all humane manners hate
nor yet maligne mans dignity and state
but finding our fraile life how euery day
it like a bubble vanisheth away
for this condition did mankinde detest
farre more incertaine then that of the beast


sure heauen doth hate this world and deadly too
else as it hath done it would neuer doe
for if it did not it would nere permit
a man of so much vertue knowledge wit
of naturall goodnesse supernaturall grace
whose courses when considerately i trace
into their ends and diligently looke
they serue me for oeconomike booke
by which this rough world i not onely stemme
in goodnesse but grow learnd by reading them
o pardon me it my much sorrow is
which makes me vse this long parenthesis
had heauen this world not hated as i say
in height of life it had not tane away


a spirit so braue so actiue and so free
that such a one who would not wish to bee
rather then weare a crowne by armes though got
so fast a friend so true a patriot
in things concerning both the worlds so wise
besides so liberall of his faculties
that where he would his industrie bestowe
he would haue done ere one could think to doe
no more talke of the working of the starres
for plenty scarcenesse or for peace or warres
they are impostures therefore get you hence
with all your planets and their influence


no more doe i care into them to looke
then in some idle chiromantick booke
shewing the line of life and _venus_ mount
nor yet no more would i of them account
then what that tells me since what that so ere
might promise man long life of care and feare
by nature freed a conscience cleare and quiet
his health his constitution and his diet
counting a hundred fourscore at the least
propt vp by prayers yet more to be encreast


all these should faile and in his fiftieth yeare
he should expire henceforth let none be deare
to me at all lest for my haplesse sake
before their time heauen from the world them take
and leaue me wretched to lament their ends
as i doe his who was a thousand friends


canst thou depart and be forgotten so
stanhope thou canst not no deare stanhope no
but in despight of death the world shall see
that muse which so much graced was by thee
can black obliuion vtterly outbraue
and set thee vp aboue thy silent graue
i meruaild much the _derbian_ nimphes were dumbe
or of those muses what should be become
that of all those the mountaines there among
not one this while thy _epicedium_sung
but so it is when they of thee were reft
they all those hills and all those riuers left


and sullen growne their former seates remoue
both from cleare _darwin_ and from siluer _doue_
and for thy losse they greeued are so sore
that they haue vowd they will come there no more
but leaue thy losse to me that i should rue thee
vnhappy man and yet i neuer knew thee
me thou didst loue vnseene so did i thee
it was our spirits that loud then and not wee
therefore without profanenesse i may call
the loue betwixt vs loue spirituall


but that which thou affectedst was so true
as that thereby thee perfectly i knew
and now that spirit which thou so loudst still mine
shall offer this a sacrifice to thine
and reare this trophe which for thee shall last
when this most beastly iron age is past
i am perswaded whilst we two haue slept
our soules haue met and to each other wept
that destenie so strongly should forbid
our bodies to conuerse as oft they did
for certainly refined spirits doe know
as doe the angels and doe here belowe
take the fruition of that endlesse blisse
as those aboue doe and what each one is
they see diuinely and as those there doe
they know each others wills so soules can too
about that dismall time thy spirit hence flew
mine much was troubled but why i not knew


in dull and sleepy sounds it often left me
as of it selfe it ment to haue bereft me
i asked it what the cause was of such woe
or what it might be that might vexe it so
but it was deafe nor my demand would here
but when that ill newes came to touch mine eare
i straightwayes found this watchfull sperit of mine
troubled had bin to take it leaue of thine
for when fate found what nature late had done
how much from heauen she for the earth had won
by thy deare birth said that it could not be
in so yong yeares what it perceiud in thee
but nature sure had framd thee long before
and as rich misers of their mighty store


keepe the most precious longst so from times past
she onely had reserued thee till the last
so did thy wisedome not thy youth behold
and tooke thee hence in thinking thou wast old
thy shape and beauty often haue to me
bin highly praysed which i thought might be
truely reported for a spirit so braue
which heauen to thee so bountifully gaue
nature could not in recompence againe
in some rich lodging but to entertaine
let not the world report then that the peake
is but a rude place only vast and bleake


and nothing hath to boast of but her lead
when she can say that happily she bred
thee and when she shall of her wonders tell
wherein she doth all other tracts excell
let her account thee greatst and still to time
of all the rest accord thee for the prime


my noble friend you challenge me to write
to you in verse and often you recite
my promise to you and to send you newes
as tis a thing i very seldome vse
and i must write of state if to _madrid_
a thing our proclamations here forbid
and that word state such latitude doth beare
as it may make me very well to feare
to write nay speake at all these let you know
your power on me yet not that i will showe


the loue i beare you in that lofty height
so cleere expression or such words of weight
as into _spanish_ if they were translated
might make the poets of that realme amated
yet these my least were but that you extort
these numbers from me when i should report
in homespunne prose in good plaine honest words
the newes our wofull _england_ vs affords
the muses here sit sad and mute the while
a sort of swine vnseasonably defile
those sacred springs which from the byclift hill
dropt their pure _nectar_ into euery quill


in this with state i hope i doe not deale
this onely tends the muses commonweale
what canst thou hope or looke for from his pen
who liues with beasts though in the shapes of men
and what a poore few are we honest still
and dare to be so when all the world is ill
i finde this age of our markt with this fate
that honest men are still precipitate
vnder base villaines which till th earth can vent
this her last brood and wholly hath them spent
shall be so then in reuolution shall
vertue againe arise by vices fall


but that shall i not see neither will i
maintaine this as one doth a prophesie
that our king _iames_ to _rome_ shall surely goe
and from his chaire the _pope_ shall ouerthrow
but o this world is so giuen vp to hell
that as the old giants which did once rebell
against the gods so this nowliuing race
dare sin yet stand and ieere heauen in the face
but soft my muse and make a little stay
surely thou art not rightly in thy way
to my good _ieffrayes_ was not i about
to write and see i suddainely am out


this is pure _satire_ that thou speakst and i
was first in hand to write an elegie
to tell my countreys shame i not delight
but doe bemoane t i am no _democrite_
o god though vertue mightily doe grieue
for all this world yet will i not beleeue
but that shees faire and louely and that she
so to the period of the world shall be
else had she beene forsaken sure of all
for that so many sundry mischiefes fall
vpon her dayly and so many take
armes vp against her as it well might make


her to forsake her nature and behind
to leaue no step for future time to find
as she had neuer beene for he that now
can doe her most disgrace him they alow
the times chiefe champion and he is the man
the prize and palme that absolutely wanne
for where kings clossets her free seat hath bin
she neere the lodge not suffered is to inne
for ignorance against her stands in state
like some great porter at a pallace gate
so dull and barbarous lately are we growne
and there are some this slauery that haue sowne


that for mans knowledge it enough doth make
if he can learne to read an almanacke
by whom that trash of _amadis de gaule_
is held an author most authenticall
and things we haue like noblemen that be
in little time which i haue hope to see
vpon their footclothes as the streets they ride
to haue their hornebookes at their girdles tid
but all their superfluity of spite
on vertues handmaid poesy doth light
and to extirpe her all their plots they lay
but to her ruine they shall misse the way
for his alone the monuments of wit
aboue the rage of tyrants that doe sit


and from their strength not one himselfe can saue
but they shall tryumph or his hated graue
in my conceipt friend thou didst neuer see
a righter madman then thou hast of me
for now as _elegiack_ i bewaile
these poor base times then suddainely i raile
and am _satirick_ not that i inforce
my selfe to be so but euen as remorse
or hate in the proud fulnesse of their hight
master my fancy iust so doe i write


but gentle friend as soone shall i behold
that stone of which so many haue vs tould
yet neuer any to this day could make
the great _elixar_ or to vndertake
the _rosecrosse_ knowledge which is much like that
a tarryingiron for fooles to labour at
as euer after i may hope to see
a plague vpon this beastly world for me


wit so respected as it was of yore
and if hereafter any it restore
it must be those that yet for many a yeare
shall be vnborne that must inhabit here
and such in vertue as shall be ashamd
almost to heare their ignorant grandsires namd
with whom so many noble spirits then liud
that were by them of all reward depriud
my noble friend i would i might haue quit
this age of these and that i might haue writ


before all other how much the braue pen
had here bin honoured of the _english_ men
goodnesse and knowledge held by them in prise
how hatefull to them ignorance and vice
but it falls out the contrary is true
and so my _ieffreyes_ for this time adue


accursed death what neede was there at all
of thee or who to councell thee did call
the subiect whereupon these lines i spend
for thee was most vnfit her timelesse end
too soone thou wroughtst too neere her thou didst stand
thou shouldst haue lent thy leane and meager hand
to those who oft the help thereof beseech
and can be cured by no other leech
in this wide world how many thousands be
that hauing past fourescore doe call for thee
the wretched debtor in the iayle that lies
yet cannot this his creditor suffice


doth woe thee oft with many a sigh and teare
yet thou art coy and him thou wilt not heare
the captiue slaue that tuggeth at the oares
and vnderneath the bulls tough sinewes rores
begs at thy hand in lieu of all his paines
that thou wouldst but release him of his chaines
yet thou a niggard listenest not thereto
with one short gaspe which thou mightst easily do
but thou couldst come to her ere there was neede
and euen at once destroy both flower and seede


but cruell death if thou so barbarous be
to those so goodly and so young as shee
that in their teeming thou wilt shew thy spight
either from marriage thou wilt maides affright
or in their wedlock widowes liues to chuse
their husbands bed and vtterly refuse
fearing conception so shalt thou thereby
extirpate mankinde by thy cruelty
if after direfull tragedy thou thirst
extinguish _himens_ torches at the first
build funerall pyles and the sad pauement strewe
with mournfull cypresse and the paleleaud yewe


away with roses myrtle and with bayes
ensignes of mirth and iollity as these
neuer at nuptials vsed be againe
but from the church the new bride entertaine
with weeping _nenias_ euer and among
as at departings be sad _requiems_ song
_lucina_ by th olde poets that wert sayd
women in childebirth euermore to ayde
because thine altars long haue layne neglected
nor as they should thy holy fiers reflected
vpon thy temples therefore thou doest flye
and wilt not helpe them in necessitie
thinking vpon thee i doe often muse
whether for thy deare sake i should accuse


nature or fortune fortune then i blame
and doe impute it as her greatest shame
to hast thy timelesse end and soone agen
i vexe at nature nay i curse her then
that at the time of need she was no stronger
that we by her might haue enioyd thee longer
but whilst of these i with my selfe debate
i call to minde how flintyhearted fate
seaseth the olde the young the faire the foule
no thing on earth can destinie controule
but yet that fate which hath of life bereft thee
still to eternall memory hath left thee
which thou enioyst by the deserued breath
that many a great one hath not after death


in days of old there lived of mighty fame
a valiant prince and theseus was his name
a chief who more in feats of arms excelld
the rising nor the setting sun beheld
of athens he was lord much land he won
and added foreign countries to his crown
in scythia with the warrior queen he strove
whom first by force he conquerd then by love
he brought in triumph back the beauteous dame
with whom her sister fair emilia came


with honour to his home let theseus ride
with love to friend and fortune for his guide
and his victorious army at his side


i pass their warlike pomp their proud array
their shouts their songs their welcome on the way


but were it not too long i would recite
the feats of amazons the fatal fight
betwixt the hardy queen and hero knight


the town besieged and how much blood it cost
the female army and the athenian host
the spousals of hippolita the queen
what tilts and tourneys at the feast were seen
the storm at their return the ladies fear
but these and other things i must forbear
the field is spacious i design to sow
with oxen far unfit to draw the plough
the remnant of my tale is of a length
to tire your patience and to waste my strength
and trivial accidents shall be forborne
that others may have time to take their turn


as was at first enjoind us by mine host
that he whose tale is best and pleases most
should win his supper at our common cost


and therefore where i left i will pursue
this ancient story whether false or true
in hope it may be mended with a new


the prince i mentiond full of high renown
in this array drew near the athenian town
when in his pomp and utmost of his pride
marching he chanced to cast his eye aside
and saw a choir of mourning dames who lay
by two and two across the common way
at his approach they raised a rueful cry
and beat their breasts and held their hands on high
creeping and crying till they seized at last
his coursers bridle and his feet embraced
tell me said theseus what and whence you are
and why this funeral pageant you prepare
is this the welcome of my worthy deeds
to meet my triumph in illomend weeds
or envy you my praise and would destroy
with grief my pleasures and pollute my joy
or are you injured and demand relief
name your request and i will ease your grief


the most in years of all the mourning train
began but swooned first away for pain
then scarce recoverd spoke nor envy we
thy great renown nor grudge thy victory
tis thine o king the afflicted to redress
and fame has filld the world with thy success
we wretched women sue for that alone
which of thy goodness is refused to none
let fall some drops of pity on our grief
if what we beg be just and we deserve relief
for none of us who now thy grace implore
but held the rank of sovereign queen before
till thanks to giddy chance which never bears
that mortal bliss should last for length of years
she cast us headlong from our high estate
and here in hope of thy return we wait
and long have waited in the temple nigh
built to the gracious goddess clemency
but reverence thou the power whose name it bears
relieve the oppressd and wipe the widows tears


i wretched i have other fortune seen
the wife of capaneus and once a queen
at thebes he fell cursed be the fatal day
and all the rest thou seest in this array
to make their moan their lords in battle lost
before that town besieged by our confederate host
but creon old and impious who commands
the theban city and usurps the lands
denies the rites of funeral fires to those
whose breathless bodies yet he calls his foes
unburnd unburied on a heap they lie
such is their fate and such his tyranny
no friend has leave to bear away the dead
but with their lifeless limbs his hounds are fed
at this she shriekd aloud the mournful train
echoed her grief and grovelling on the plain
with groans and hands upheld to move his mind
besought his pity to their helpless kind


the prince was touchd his tears began to flow
and as his tender heart would break in two
he sighd and could not but their fate deplore
so wretched now so fortunate before
then lightly from his lofty steed he flew
and raising one by one the suppliant crew
to comfort each full solemnly he swore
that by the faith which knights to knighthood bore
and whateer else to chivalry belongs
he would not cease till he revenged their wrongs
that greece should see performd what he declared
and cruel creon find his just reward


he said no more but shunning all delay
rode on nor enterd athens on his way
but left his sister and his queen behind
and waved his royal banner in the wind
where in an argent field the god of war
was drawn triumphant on his iron car


red was his sword and shield and whole attire
and all the godhead seemd to glow with fire
even the ground glitterd where the standard flew
and the green grass was dyed to sanguine hue
high on his pointed lance his pennon bore
his cretan fight the conquerd minotaur
the soldiers shout around with generous rage
and in that victory their own presage
he praised their ardour inly pleased to see
his host the flower of grecian chivalry


all day he marchd and all the ensuing night
and saw the city with returning light
the process of the war i need not tell
how theseus conquerd and how creon fell
or after how by storm the walls were won
or how the victor sackd and burnd the town
how to the ladies he restored again
the bodies of their lords in battle slain


and with what ancient rites they were interrd
all these to fitter times shall be deferrd
i spare the widows tears their woeful cries
and howling at their husbands obsequies
how theseus at these funerals did assist
and with what gifts the mourning dames dismissd


thus when the victor chief had creon slain
and conquerd thebes he pitchd upon the plain
his mighty camp and when the day returnd
the country wasted and the hamlets burnd
and left the pillagers to rapine bred
without control to strip and spoil the dead


there in a heap of slain among the rest
two youthful knights they found beneath a load oppressd
of slaughterd foes whom first to death they sent
the trophies of their strength a bloody monument
both fair and both of royal blood they seemd
whom kinsmen to the crown the heralds deemd
that day in equal arms they fought for fame
their swords their shields their surcoats were the same
close by each other laid they pressd the ground
their manly bosoms pierced with many a grisly wound
nor well alive nor wholly dead they were
but some faint signs of feeble life appear


the wandering breath was on the wing to part
weak was the pulse and hardly heaved the heart
these two were sisters sons and arcite one
much famed in fields with valiant palamon
from these their costly arms the spoilers rent
and softly both conveyd to theseus tent
whom known of creons line and cured with care
he to his city sent as prisoners of the war
hopeless of ransom and condemnd to lie
in durance doomd a lingering death to die


this done he marchd away with warlike sound
and to his athens turnd with laurels crownd
where happy long he lived much loved and more renownd


but in a tower and never to be loosed
the woful captive kinsmen are enclosed
thus year by year they pass and day by day
till once twas on the morn of cheerful may
the young emilia fairer to be seen
than the fair lily on the flowery green
more fresh than may herself in blossoms new
for with the rosy colour strove her hue
waked as her custom was before the day
to do the observance due to sprightly may
for sprightly may commands our youth to keep
the vigils of her night and breaks their sluggard sleep
each gentle breast with kindly warmth she moves
inspires new flames revives extinguishd loves
in this remembrance emily ere day
arose and dressd herself in rich array
fresh as the month and as the morning fair
adown her shoulders fell her length of hair
a riband did the braided tresses bind
the rest was loose and wantond in the wind
aurora had but newly chased the night
and purpled oer the sky with blushing light


when to the garden walk she took her way
to sport and trip along in cool of day
and offer maiden vows in honour of the may


at every turn she made a little stand
and thrust among the thorns her lily hand
to draw the rose and every rose she drew
she shook the stalk and brushd away the dew
then partycolourd flowers of white and red
she wove to make a garland for her head
this done she sung and carolld out so clear
that men and angels might rejoice to hear
even wondering philomel forgot to sing
and learnd from her to welcome in the spring
the tower of which before was mention made
within whose keep the captive knights were laid
built of a large extent and strong withal
was one partition of the palace wall
the garden was enclosed within the square
where young emilia took the morning air


it happend palamon the prisoner knight
restless for woe arose before the light
and with his jailers leave desired to breathe
an air more wholesome than the damps beneath
this granted to the tower he took his way
cheerd with the promise of a glorious day


then cast a languishing regard around
and saw with hateful eyes the temples crownd
with golden spires and all the hostile ground


he sighd and turnd his eyes because he knew
twas but a larger jail he had in view
then lookd below and from the castles height
beheld a nearer and more pleasing sight


the garden which before he had not seen
in springs new livery clad of white and green
fresh flowers in wide parterres and shady walks between


this viewd but not enjoyd with arms across
he stood reflecting on his countrys loss
himself an object of the public scorn
and often wishd he never had been born
at last for so his destiny required
with walking giddy and with thinking tired
he through a little window cast his sight
though thick of bars that gave a scanty light
but even that glimmering served him to descry
the inevitable charms of emily


scarce had he seen but seized with sudden smart
stung to the quick he felt it at his heart
struck blind with overpowering light he stood
then started back amazed and cried aloud


young arcite heard and up he ran with haste
to help his friend and in his arms embraced
and askd him why he lookd so deadly wan
and whence and how his change of cheer began
or who had done the offence but if said he
your grief alone is hard captivity
for love of heaven with patience undergo
a cureless ill since fate will have it so
so stood our horoscope in chains to lie
and saturn in the dungeon of the sky
or other baleful aspect ruled our birth
when all the friendly stars were under earth
whateer betides by destiny tis done
and better bear like men than vainly seek to shun
nor of my bonds said palamon again
nor of unhappy planets i complain
but when my mortal anguish caused my cry
that moment i was hurt through either eye


pierced with a random shaft i faint away
and perish with insensible decay
a glance of some new goddess gave the wound
whom like actaeon unaware i found


look how she walks along yon shady space
not juno moves with more majestic grace
and all the cyprian queen is in her face


if thou art venus for thy charms confess
that face was formd in heaven nor art thou less
disguised in habit undisguised in shape
oh help us captives from our chains to scape
but if our doom be past in bonds to lie
for life and in a loathsome dungeon die
then be thy wrath appeased with our disgrace
and show compassion to the theban race
oppressd by tyrant power while yet he spoke
arcite on emily had fixd his look


the fatal dart a ready passage found
and deep within his heart infixd the wound
so that if palamon were wounded sore
arcite was hurt as much as he or more
then from his inmost soul he sighd and said
the beauty i behold has struck me dead
unknowingly she strikes and kills by chance
poison is in her eyes and death in every glance
oh i must ask nor ask alone but move
her mind to mercy or must die for love
thus arcite and thus palamon replies
eager his tone and ardent were his eyes


speakst thou in earnest or in jesting vein
jesting said arcite suits but ill with pain
it suits far worse said palamon again


and bent his brows with men who honour weigh
their faith to break their friendship to betray
but worst with thee of noble lineage born
my kinsman and in arms my brother sworn
have we not plighted each our holy oath
that one should be the common good of both


one soul should both inspire and neither prove
his fellows hindrance in pursuit of love
to this before the gods we gave our hands
and nothing but our death can break the bands
this binds thee then to further my design
as i am bound by vow to further thine
nor canst nor darst thou traitor on the plain
appeach my honour or thine own maintain
since thou art of my council and the friend
whose faith i trust and on whose care depend
and wouldst thou court my ladys love which i
much rather than release would choose to die
but thou false arcite never shall obtain
thy bad pretence i told thee first my pain
for first my love began ere thine was born
thou as my council and my brother sworn
art bound to assist my eldership of right
or justly to be deemd a perjured knight


thus palamon but arcite with disdain
in haughty language thus replied again
forsworn thyself the traitors odious name
i first return and then disprove thy claim
if love be passion and that passion nursed
with strong desires i loved the lady first
canst thou pretend desire whom zeal inflamed
to worship and a power celestial named
thine was devotion to the blest above
i saw the woman and desired her love
first ownd my passion and to thee commend
the important secret as my chosen friend
suppose which yet i grant not thy desire
a moment elder than my rival fire
can chance of seeing first thy title prove
and knowst thou not no law is made for love
law is to things which to free choice relate
love is not in our choice but in our fate


laws are but positive loves power we see
is natures sanction and her first decree
each day we break the bond of human laws
for love and vindicate the common cause
laws for defence of civil rights are placed
love throws the fences down and makes a general waste
maids widows wives without distinction fall
the sweeping deluge love comes on and covers all


if then the laws of friendship i transgress
i keep the greater while i break the less
and both are mad alike since neither can possess


both hopeless to be ransomd never more
to see the sun but as he passes oer
like aesops hounds contending for the bone
each pleaded right and would be lord alone
the fruitless fight continued all the day
a cur came by and snatchd the prize away
as courtiers therefore jostle for a grant
and when they break their friendship plead their want
so thou if fortune will thy suit advance
love on nor envy me my equal chance
for i must love and am resolved to try
my fate or failing in the adventure die


great was their strife which hourly was renewd
till each with mortal hate his rival viewd
now friends no more nor walking hand in hand
but when they met they made a surly stand
and glared like angry lions as they passd
and wishd that every look might be their last


it chanced at length pirithous came to attend
this worthy theseus his familiar friend
their love in early infancy began
and rose as childhood ripend into man


companions of the war and loved so well
that when one died as ancient stories tell
his fellow to redeem him went to hell


but to pursue my tale to welcome home
his warlike brother is pirithous come
arcite of thebes was known in arms long since
and honourd by this young thessalian prince
theseus to gratify his friend and guest
who made our arcites freedom his request
restored to liberty the captive knight
but on these hard conditions i recite
that if hereafter arcite should be found
within the compass of athenian ground
by day or night or on whateer pretence
his head should pay the forfeit of the offence
to this pirithous for his friend agreed
and on his promise was the prisoner freed


unpleased and pensive hence he takes his way
at his own peril for his life must pay
who now but arcite mourns his bitter fate
finds his dear purchase and repents too late
what have i gaind he said in prison pent
if i but change my bonds for banishment
and banishd from her sight i suffer more
in freedom than i felt in bonds before
forced from her presence and condemnd to live
unwelcome freedom and unthankd reprieve


heaven is not but where emily abides
and where shes absent all is hell besides
next to my day of birth was that accursed
which bound my friendship to pirithous first
had i not known that prince i still had been
in bondage and had still emilia seen
for though i never can her grace deserve
tis recompence enough to see and serve
o palamon my kinsman and my friend
how much more happy fates thy love attend
thine is the adventure thine the victory
well has thy fortune turnd the dice for thee
thou on that angels face mayst feed thine eyes
in prison no but blissful paradise
thou daily seest that sun of beauty shine
and lovest at least in loves extremest line


i mourn in absence loves eternal night
and who can tell but since thou hast her sight
and art a comely young and valiant knight


fortune a various power may cease to frown
and by some ways unknown thy wishes crown
but i the most forlorn of human kind
nor help can hope nor remedy can find
but doomd to drag my loathsome life in care
for my reward must end it in despair
fire water air and earth and force of fates
that governs all and heaven that all creates
nor art nor natures hand can ease my grief
nothing but death the wretchs last relief
then farewell youth and all the joys that dwell
with youth and life and life itself farewell


but why alas do mortal men in vain
of fortune fate or providence complain
god gives us what he knows our wants require
and better things than those which we desire
some pray for riches riches they obtain
but watchd by robbers for their wealth are slain
some pray from prison to be freed and come
when guilty of their vows to fall at home
murderd by those they trusted with their life
a favourd servant or a bosom wife


such dearbought blessings happen every day
because we know not for what things to pray
like drunken sots about the street we roam
well knows the sot he has a certain home
yet knows not how to find the uncertain place
and blunders on and staggers every pace
thus all seek happiness but few can find
for far the greater part of men are blind
this is my case who thought our utmost good
was in one word of freedom understood
the fatal blessing came from prison free
i starve abroad and lose the sight of emily


thus arcite but if arcite thus deplore
his sufferings palamon yet suffers more
for when he knew his rival freed and gone
he swells with wrath he makes outrageous moan
he frets he fumes he stares he stamps the ground
the hollow tower with clamours rings around
with briny tears he bathed his fetterd feet
and droppd all oer with agony of sweat
alas he cried i wretch in prison pine
too happy rival while the fruit is thine


thou livest at large thou drawst thy native air
pleased with thy freedom proud of my despair
thou mayst since thou hast youth and courage joind
a sweet behaviour and a solid mind
assemble ours and all the theban race
to vindicate on athens thy disgrace
and after by some treaty made possess
fair emily the pledge of lasting peace
so thine shall be the beauteous prize while i
must languish in despair in prison die
thus all the advantage of the strife is thine
thy portion double joys and double sorrows mine


the rage of jealousy then fired his soul
and his face kindled like a burning coal
now cold despair succeeding in her stead
to livid paleness turns the glowing red
his blood scarce liquid creeps within his veins
like water which the freezing wind constrains
then thus he said eternal deities
who rule the world with absolute decrees
and write whatever time shall bring to pass
with pens of adamant on plates of brass
what is the race of human kind your care
beyond what all his fellowcreatures are


he with the rest is liable to pain
and like the sheep his brotherbeast is slain
cold hunger prisons ills without a cure
all these he must and guiltless oft endure
or does your justice power or prescience fail
when the good suffer and the bad prevail
what worse to wretched virtue could befall
if fate or giddy fortune governd all
nay worse than other beasts is our estate
them to pursue their pleasures you create
we bound by harder laws must curb our will
and your commands not our desires fulfil


then when the creature is unjustly slain
yet after death at least he feels no pain
but man in life surcharged with woe before
not freed when dead is doomd to suffer more
a serpent shoots his sting at unaware
an ambushd thief forelays a traveller
the man lies murderd while the thief and snake
one gains the thickets and one threads the brake
this let divines decide but well i know
just or unjust i have my share of woe
through saturn seated in a luckless place
and junos wrath that persecutes my race
or mars and venus in a quartile move
my pangs of jealousy for arcites love


let palamon oppressd in bondage mourn
while to his exiled rival we return
by this the sun declining from his height
the day had shortend to prolong the night
the lengthend night gave length of misery
both to the captive lover and the free
for palamon in endless prison mourns
and arcite forfeits life if he returns
the banishd never hopes his love to see
nor hopes the captive lord his liberty
tis hard to say who suffers greater pains
one sees his love but cannot break his chains
one free and all his motions uncontrolld
beholds whateer he would but what he would behold
judge as you please for i will haste to tell
what fortune to the banishd knight befell


when arcite was to thebes returnd again
the loss of her he loved renewd his pain
what could be worse than never more to see
his life his soul his charming emily
he raved with all the madness of despair
he roard he beat his breast he tore his hair
dry sorrow in his stupid eyes appears
for wanting nourishment he wanted tears
his eyeballs in their hollow sockets sink
bereft of sleep he loathes his meat and drink
he withers at his heart and looks as wan
as the pale spectre of a murderd man


that pale turns yellow and his face receives
the faded hue of sapless boxen leaves
in solitary groves he makes his moan
walks early out and ever is alone
nor mixd in mirth in youthful pleasures shares
but sighs when songs and instruments he hears


his spirits are so low his voice is drownd
he hears as from afar or in a swound
like the deaf murmurs of a distant sound


uncombd his locks and squalid his attire
unlike the trim of love and gay desire
but full of museful mopings which presage
the loss of reason and conclude in rage


this when he had endured a year and more
now wholly changed from what he was before
it happend once that slumbering as he lay
he dreamd his dream began at break of day
that hermes oer his head in air appeard
and with soft words his drooping spirits cheerd
his hat adornd with wings disclosed the god
and in his hand he bore the sleepcompelling rod
such as he seemd when at his sires command
on argus head he laid the snaky wand
arise he said to conquering athens go
there fate appoints an end to all thy woe


the fright awakend arcite with a start
against his bosom bounced his heaving heart
but soon he said with scarcerecoverd breath
and thither will i go to meet my death
sure to be slain but death is my desire
since in emilias sight i shall expire
by chance he spied a mirror while he spoke
and gazing there beheld his alterd look
wondering he saw his features and his hue
so much were changed that scarce himself he knew
a sudden thought then starting in his mind
since i in arcite cannot arcite find
the world may search in vain with all their eyes
but never penetrate through this disguise
thanks to the change which grief and sickness give
in low estate i may securely live


and see unknown my mistress day by day
he said and clothed himself in coarse array
a labouring hind in show then forth he went
and to the athenian towers his journey bent
one squire attended in the same disguise
made conscious of his masters enterprise
arrived at athens soon he came to court
unknown unquestiond in that thick resort
proffering for hire his service at the gate
to drudge draw water and to run or wait


so fair befell him that for little gain
he served at first emilias chamberlain
and watchful all advantages to spy
was still at hand and in his masters eye
and as his bones were big and sinews strong
refused no toil that could to slaves belong
but from deep wells with engines water drew
and used his noble hands the wood to hew
he passd a year at least attending thus
on emily and calld philostratus
but never was there man of his degree
so much esteemd so well beloved as he
so gentle of condition was he known
that through the court his courtesy was blown


all think him worthy of a greater place
and recommend him to the royal grace
that exercised within a higher sphere
his virtues more conspicuous might appear
thus by the general voice was arcite praised
and by great theseus to high favour raised
among his menial servants first enrolld
and largely entertaind with sums of gold
besides what secretly from thebes was sent
of his own income and his annual rent
this well employd he purchased friends and fame
but cautiously conceald from whence it came
thus for three years he lived with large increase
in arms of honour and esteem in peace
to theseus person he was ever near
and theseus for his virtues held him dear


while arcite lives in bliss the story turns
where hopeless palamon in prison mourns
for six long years immured the captive knight
had draggd his chains and scarcely seen the light
lost liberty and love at once he bore
his prison paind him much his passion more
nor dares he hope his fetters to remove
nor ever wishes to be free from love


but when the sixth revolving year was run
and may within the twins received the sun
were it by chance or forceful destiny
which forms in causes first whateer shall be
assisted by a friend one moonless night
this palamon from prison took his flight
a pleasant beverage he prepared before
of wine and honey mixd with added store
of opium to his keeper this he brought
who swallowd unaware the sleepy draught
and snored secure till morn his senses bound
in slumber and in long oblivion drownd
short was the night and careful palamon
sought the next covert eer the rising sun


a thickspread forest near the city lay
to this with lengthend strides he took his way
for far he could not fly and feard the day


safe from pursuit he meant to shun the light
till the brown shadows of the friendly night
to thebes might favour his intended flight


when to his country come his next design
was all the theban race in arms to join
and war on theseus till he lost his life
or won the beauteous emily to wife


thus while his thoughts the lingering day beguile
to gentle arcite let us turn our style
who little dreamt how nigh he was to care
till treacherous fortune caught him in the snare
the morning lark the messenger of day
saluted in her song the morning gray
and soon the sun arose with beams so bright
that all the horizon laughd to see the joyous sight
he with his tepid rays the rose renews
and licks the drooping leaves and dries the dews
when arcite left his bed resolved to pay
observance to the month of merry may
forth on his fiery steed betimes he rode
that scarcely prints the turf on which he trode
at ease he seemd and prancing oer the plains
turnd only to the grove his horses reins
the grove i named before and lighted there
a woodbine garland sought to crown his hair
then turnd his face against the rising day
and raised his voice to welcome in the may


for thee sweet month the groves green liveries wear
if not the first the fairest of the year
for thee the graces lead the dancing hours
and natures ready pencil paints the flowers
when thy short reign is past the feverish sun
the sultry tropic fears and moves more slowly on
so may thy tender blossoms fear no blight
nor goats with venomd teeth thy tendrils bite
as thou shalt guide my wandering feet to find
the fragrant greens i seek my brows to bind


his vows addressd within the grove he strayd
till fate or fortune near the place conveyd
his steps where secret palamon was laid


full little thought of him the gentle knight
who flying death had there conceald his flight
in brakes and brambles hid and shunning mortal sight


and less he knew him for his hated foe
but feard him as a man he did not know
but as it has been said of ancient years
that fields are full of eyes and woods have ears
for this the wise are ever on their guard
for unforeseen they say is unprepared
uncautious arcite thought himself alone
and less than all suspected palamon
who listening heard him while he searchd the grove
and loudly sung his roundelay of love
but on the sudden stoppd and silent stood
as lovers often muse and change their mood


now high as heaven and then as low as hell
now up now down as buckets in a well
for venus like her day will change her cheer
and seldom shall we see a friday clear
thus arcite having sung with alterd hue
sunk on the ground and from his bosom drew
a desperate sigh accusing heaven and fate
and angry junos unrelenting hate


cursed be the day when first i did appear
let it be blotted from the calendar
lest it pollute the month and poison all the year


still will the jealous queen pursue our race
cadmus is dead the theban city was


yet ceases not her hate for all who come
from cadmus are involved in cadmus doom
i suffer for my blood unjust decree
that punishes anothers crime on me
in mean estate i serve my mortal foe
the man who caused my countrys overthrow


this is not all for juno to my shame
has forced me to forsake my former name
arcite i was philostratus i am


that side of heaven is all my enemy
mars ruind thebes his mother ruind me
of all the royal race remains but one
besides myself the unhappy palamon
whom theseus holds in bonds and will not free
without a crime except his kin to me
yet these and all the rest i could endure
but loves a malady without a cure
fierce love has pierced me with his fiery dart
he fires within and hisses at my heart
your eyes fair emily my fate pursue
i suffer for the rest i die for you
of such a goddess no time leaves record
who burnd the temple where she was adored
and let it burn i never will complain
pleased with my sufferings if you knew my pain


at this a sickly qualm his heart assaild
his ears ring inward and his senses faild
no word missd palamon of all he spoke
but soon to deadly pale he changed his look
he trembled every limb and felt a smart
as if cold steel had glided through his heart
no longer staid but starting from his place
discoverd stood and showd his hostile face
false traitor arcite traitor to thy blood
bound by thy sacred oath to seek my good
now art thou found forsworn for emily
and darest attempt her love for whom i die
so hast thou cheated theseus with a wile
against thy vow returning to beguile
under a borrowd name as false to me
so false thou art to him who set thee free
but rest assured that either thou shalt die
or else renounce thy claim in emily
for though unarmd i am and freed by chance
am here without my sword or pointed lance
hope not base man unquestioned hence to go
for i am palamon thy mortal foe


arcite who heard his tale and knew the man
his sword unsheathd and fiercely thus began
now by the gods who govern heaven above
wert thou not weak with hunger mad with love
that word had been thy last or in this grove
this hand should force thee to renounce thy love


the surety which i gave thee i defy
fool not to know that love endures no tie
and jove but laughs at lovers perjury


know i will serve the fair in thy despite
but since thou art my kinsman and a knight
here have my faith tomorrow in this grove
our arms shall plead the titles of our love
and heaven so help my right as i alone
will come and keep the cause and quarrel both unknown
with arms of proof both for myself and thee
choose thou the best and leave the worst to me
and that at better ease thou mayst abide
bedding and clothes i will this night provide
and needful sustenance that thou mayst be
a conquest better won and worthy me
his promise palamon accepts but prayd
to keep it better than the first he made
thus fair they parted till the morrows dawn
for each had laid his plighted faith to pawn


oh love thou sternly dost thy power maintain
and wilt not bear a rival in thy reign
tyrants and thou all fellowship disdain


this was in arcite proved and palamon
both in despair yet each would love alone
arcite returnd and as in honour tied
his foe with bedding and with food supplied
then ere the day two suits of armour sought
which borne before him on his steed he brought
both were of shining steel and wrought so pure
as might the strokes of two such arms endure
now at the time and in the appointed place
the challenger and challenged face to face
approach each other from afar they knew
and from afar their hatred changed their hue
so stands the thracian herdsman with his spear
pull in the gap and hopes the hunted bear
and hears him rustling in the wood and sees
his course at distance by the bending trees
and thinks here comes my mortal enemy
and either he must fall in fight or i


this while he thinks he lifts aloft his dart
a generous chilness seizes every part
the veins pour back the blood and fortify the heart


thus pale they meet their eyes with fury burn
none greets for none the greeting will return
but in dumb surliness each armd with care
his foe professd as brother of the war
then both no moment lost at once advance
against each other armd with sword and lance
they lash they foin they pass they strive to bore
their corslets and the thinnest parts explore
thus two long hours in equal arms they stood
and wounded wound till both were bathed in blood
and not a foot of ground had either got
as if the world depended on the spot
fell arcite like an angry tiger fared
and like a lion palamon appeard
or as two boars whom love to battle draws
with rising bristles and with frothy jaws
their adverse breasts with tusks oblique they wound
with grunts and groans the forest rings around
so fought the knights and fighting must abide
till fate an umpire sends their difference to decide


the power that ministers to gods decrees
and executes on earth what heaven foresees
calld providence or chance or fatal sway
comes with resistless force and finds or makes her way
nor kings nor nations nor united power
one moment can retard the appointed hour
and some one day some wondrous chance appears
which happend not in centuries of years
for sure whateer we mortals hate or love
or hope or fear depends on powers above
they move our appetites to good or ill
and by foresight necessitate the will
in theseus this appears whose youthful joy
was beasts of chase in forests to destroy


this gentle knight inspired by jolly may
forsook his easy couch at early day
and to the wood and wilds pursued his way


beside him rode hippolita the queen
and emily attired in lively green
with horns and hounds and all the tuneful cry
to hunt a royal hart within the covert nigh
and as he followd mars before so now
he serves the goddess of the silver bow
the way that theseus took was to the wood
where the two knights in cruel battle stood
the lawn on which they fought the appointed place
in which the uncoupled hounds began the chase
thither forthright he rode to rouse the prey
that shaded by the fern in harbour lay
and thence dislodged was wont to leave the wood
for open fields and cross the crystal flood
approachd and looking underneath the sun
he saw proud arcite and fierce palamon
in mortal battle doubling blow on blow
like lightning flamed their falchions to and fro
and shot a dreadful gleam so strong they strook
there seemd less force required to fell an oak
he gazed with wonder on their equal might
lookd eager on but knew not either knight
resolved to learn he spurrd his fiery steed
with goring rowels to provoke his speed
the minute ended that began the race
so soon he was betwixt them on the place
and with his sword unsheathd on pain of life
commands both combatants to cease their strife
then with imperious tone pursues his threat
what are you why in arms together met


how dares your pride presume against my laws
as in a listed field to fight your cause
unaskd the royal grant no marshal by
as knightly rites require nor judge to try
then palamon with scarce recoverd breath
thus hasty spoke we both deserve the death
and both would die for look the world around
a pair so wretched is not to be found
our lifes a load encumberd with the charge
we long to set the imprisond soul at large


now as thou art a sovereign judge decree
the rightful doom of death to him and me
let neither find thy grace for grace is cruelty


me first oh kill me first and cure my woe
then sheath the sword of justice on my foe
or kill him first for when his name is heard
he foremost will receive his due reward
arcite of thebes is he thy mortal foe
on whom thy grace did liberty bestow


but first contracted that if ever found
by day or night upon the athenian ground
his head should pay the forfeit see returnd
the perjured knight his oath and honour scornd
for this is he who with a borrowd name
and profferd service to thy palace came


now calld philostratus retaind by thee
a traitor trusted and in high degree
aspiring to the bed of beauteous emily


my part remains from thebes my birth i own
and call myself the unhappy palamon
think me not like that man since no disgrace
can force me to renounce the honour of my race
know me for what i am i broke my chain
nor promised i thy prisoner to remain
the love of liberty with life is given
and life itself the inferior gift of heaven
thus without crime i fled but further know
i with this arcite am thy mortal foe
then give me death since i thy life pursue
for safeguard of thyself death is my due
more wouldst thou know i love bright emily
and for her sake and in her sight will die


but kill my rival too for he no less
deserves and i thy righteous doom will bless
assured that what i lose he never shall possess


to this replied the stern athenian prince
and sourly smiled in owning your offence
you judge yourself and i but keep record
in place of law while you pronounce the word
take your desert the death you have decreed
i seal your doom and ratify the deed
by mars the patron of my arms you die
he said dumb sorrow seized the standersby
the queen above the rest by nature good
the pattern formd of perfect womanhood
for tender pity wept when she began
through the bright quire the infectious virtue ran
all dropt their tears even the contended maid
and thus among themselves they softly said
what eyes can suffer this unworthy sight
two youths of royal blood renownd in fight
the mastership of heaven in face and mind
and lovers far beyond their faithless kind
see their wide streaming wounds they neither came
for pride of empire nor desire of fame
kings fight for kingdoms madmen for applause
but love for love alone that crowns the lovers cause
this thought which ever bribes the beauteous kind
such pity wrought in every ladys mind
they left their steeds and prostrate on the place
from the fierce king implored the offenders grace


he paused a while stood silent in his mood
for yet his rage was boiling in his blood
but soon his tender mind the impression felt
as softest metals are not slow to melt
and pity soonest runs in softest minds
then reasons with himself and first he finds
his passion cast a mist before his sense
and either made or magnified the offence
offence of what to whom who judged the cause
the prisoner freed himself by natures laws
born free he sought his right the man he freed
was perjured but his love excused the deed
thus pondering he lookd under with his eyes
and saw the womens tears and heard their cries
which moved compassion more he shook his head
and softly sighing to himself he said
curse on the unpardoning prince whom tears can draw
to no remorse who rules by lions law


and deaf to prayers by no submission bowd
rends all alike the penitent and proud
at this with look serene he raised his head
reason resumed her place and passion fled
then thus aloud he spoke the power of love
in earth and seas and air and heaven above
rules unresisted with an awful nod
by daily miracles declared a god
he blinds the wise gives eyesight to the blind
and moulds and stamps anew the lovers mind
behold that arcite and this palamon
freed from my fetters and in safety gone
what hinderd either in their native soil
at ease to reap the harvest of their toil
but love their lord did otherwise ordain
and brought them in their own despite again
to suffer death deserved for well they know
tis in my power and i their deadly foe
the proverb holds that to be wise and love
is hardly granted to the gods above


see how the madmen bleed behold the gains
with which their master love rewards their pains
for seven long years on duty every day
lo their obedience and their monarchs pay
yet as in duty bound they serve him on
and ask the fools they think it wisely done
nor ease nor wealth nor life itself regard
for tis their maxim love is loves reward
this is not all the fair for whom they strove
nor knew before nor could suspect their love
nor thought when she beheld the sight from far
her beauty was the occasion of the war
but sure a general doom on man is past
and all are fools and lovers first or last
this both by others and myself i know
for i have served their sovereign long ago


oft have been caught within the winding train
of female snares and felt the lovers pain
and learnd how far the god can human hearts constrain


to this remembrance and the prayers of those
who for the offending warriors interpose
i give their forfeit lives on this accord
to do me homage as their sovereign lord
and as my vassals to their utmost might
assist my person and assert my right


this freely sworn the knights their grace obtaind
then thus the king his secret thoughts explaind
if wealth or honour or a royal race
or each or all may win a ladys grace
then either of you knights may well deserve
a princess born and such is she you serve
for emily is sister to the crown
and but too well to both her beauty known
but should you combat till you both were dead
two lovers cannot share a single bed
as therefore both are equal in degree
the lot of both be left to destiny
now hear the award and happy may it prove
to her and him who best deserves her love
depart from hence in peace and free as air
search the wide world and where you please repair
but on the day when this returning sun
to the same point through every sign has run


then each of you his hundred knights shall bring
in royal lists to fight before the king
and then the knight whom fate or happy chance
shall with his friends to victory advance
and grace his arms so far in equal fight
from out the bars to force his opposite
or kill or make him recreant on the plain
the prize of valour and of love shall gain
the vanquishd party shall their claim release
and the long jars conclude in lasting peace
the charge be mine to adorn the chosen ground
the theatre of war for champions so renownd


and take the patrons place of either knight
with eyes impartial to behold the fight
and heaven of me so judge as i shall judge aright


if both are satisfied with this accord
swear by the laws of knighthood on my sword


who now but palamon exults with joy
and ravishd arcite seems to touch the sky
the whole assembled troop was pleased as well
extol the award and on their knees they fell
to bless the gracious king the knights with leave
departing from the place his last commands receive
on emily with equal ardour look
and from her eyes their inspiration took
from thence to thebes old walls pursue their way
each to provide his champions for the day


it might be deemd on our historians part
or too much negligence or want of art
if he forgot the vast magnificence
of royal theseus and his large expense
he first enclosed for lists a level ground
the whole circumference a mile around
the form was circular and all without
a trench was sunk to moat the place about
within an amphitheatre appeard
raised in degrees to sixty paces reard
that when a man was placed in one degree
height was allowd for him above to see


eastward was built a gate of marble white
the like adornd the western opposite
a nobler object than this fabric was
rome never saw nor of so vast a space
for rich with spoils of many a conquerd land
all arts and artists theseus could command
who sold for hire or wrought for better fame
the masterpainters and the carvers came
so rose within the compass of the year
an ages work a glorious theatre
then oer its eastern gate was raised above
a temple sacred to the queen of love
an altar stood below on either hand
a priest with roses crownd who held a myrtle wand
the dome of mars was on the gate opposed
and on the north a turret was enclosed


within the wall of alabaster white
and crimson coral for the queen of night
who takes in sylvan sports her chaste delight


within these oratories might you see
rich carvings portraitures and imagery
where every figure to the life expressd
the godheads power to whom it was addressd
in venus temple on the sides were seen
the broken slumbers of enamourd men
prayers that even spoke and pity seemd to call
and issuing sighs that smoked along the wall
complaints and hot desires the lovers hell
and scalding tears that wore a channel where they fell


and all around were nuptial bonds the ties
of loves assurance and a train of lies
that made in lust conclude in perjuries


beauty and youth and wealth and luxury
and spritely hope and shortenduring joy
and sorceries to raise the infernal powers
and sigils framed in planetary hours
expense and afterthought and idle care
and doubts of motley hue and dark despair
suspicious and fantastical surmise
and jealousy suffused with jaundice in her eyes
discolouring all she viewd in tawny dressd
downlookd and with a cuckoo on her fist
opposed to her on the other side advance
the costly feast the carol and the dance


minstrels and music poetry and play
and balls by night and tournaments by day
all these were painted on the wall and more
with acts and monuments of times before
and others added by prophetic doom
and lovers yet unborn and loves to come
for there the idalian mount and citheron
the court of venus was in colours drawn
before the palacegate in careless dress
and loose array sat portress idleness


there by the fount narcissus pined alone
there samson was with wiser solomon
and all the mighty names by love undone


medeas charms were there circean feasts
with bowls that turnd enamourd youths to beasts
here might be seen that beauty wealth and wit
and prowess to the power of love submit


the spreading snare for all mankind is laid
and lovers all betray and are betrayd
the goddess self some noble hand had wrought
smiling she seemd and full of pleasing thought
from ocean as she first began to rise
and smoothd the ruffled seas and cleard the skies
she trode the brine all bare below the breast
and the green waves but ill conceald the rest
a lute she held and on her head was seen
a wreath of roses red and myrtles green
her turtles fannd the buxom air above
and by his mother stood an infant love


with wings unfledged his eyes were banded oer
his hands a bow his back a quiver bore
supplied with arrows bright and keen a deadly store


but in the dome of mighty mars the red
with different figures all the sides were spread
this temple less in form with equal grace
was imitative of the first in thrace
for that cold region was the loved abode
and sovereign mansion of the warrior god
the landscape was a forest wide and bare
where neither beast nor human kind repair
the fowl that scent afar the borders fly
and shun the bitter blast and wheel about the sky
a cake of scurf lies baking on the ground
and prickly stubs instead of trees are found
or woods with knots and knares deformd and old
headless the most and hideous to behold
a rattling tempest through the branches went
that strippd them bare and one sole way they bent


heaven froze above severe the clouds congeal
and through the crystal vault appeard the standing hail
such was the face without a mountain stood
threatening from high and overlookd the wood
beneath the lowering brow and on a bent
the temple stood of mars armipotent
the frame of burnishd steel that cast a glare
from far and seemd to thaw the freezing air
a strait long entry to the temple led
blind with high walls and horror over head
thence issued such a blast and hollow roar
as threatend from the hinge to heave the door
in through that door a northern light there shone
twas all it had for windows there were none
the gate was adamant eternal frame
which hewd by mars himself from indian quarries came


the labour of a god and all along
tough iron plates were clenchd to make it strong
a tun about was every pillar there
a polishd mirror shone not half so clear


there saw i how the secret felon wrought
and treason labouring in the traitors thought
and midwife time the ripend plot to murder brought


there the red anger dared the pallid fear
next stood hypocrisy with holy leer
soft smiling and demurely looking down
but hid the dagger underneath the gown
the assassinating wife the household fiend
and far the blackest there the traitorfriend
on the other side there stood destruction bare
unpunishd rapine and a waste of war
contest with sharpend knives in cloisters drawn
and all with blood bespread the holy lawn


loud menaces were heard and foul disgrace
and bawling infamy in language base
till sense was lost in sound and silence fled the place


the slayer of himself yet saw i there
the gore congeald was clotted in his hair
with eyes half closed and gaping mouth he lay
and grim as when he breathed his sullen soul away
in midst of all the dome misfortune sate
and gloomy discontent and fell debate
and madness laughing in his ireful mood
and armd complaint on theft and cries of blood
there was the murderd corpse in covert laid
and violent death in thousand shapes displayd
the city to the soldiers rage resigned
successless wars and poverty behind
ships burnt in fight or forced on rocky shores
and the rash hunter strangled by the boars
the newborn babe by nurses overlaid
and the cook caught within the raging fire he made
all ills of mars his nature flame and steel
the gasping charioteer beneath the wheel


of his own car the ruind house that falls
and intercepts her lord betwixt the walls
the whole division that to mars pertains
all trades of death that deal in steel for gains
were there the butcher armourer and smith
whose forges sharpend falchions or the scythe
the scarlet conquest on a tower was placed
with shouts and soldiers acclamations graced
a pointed sword hung threatening oer his head
sustaind but by a slender twine of thread
there saw i mars his ides the capitol
the seer in vain foretelling caesars fall
the last triumvirs and the wars they move
and antony who lost the world for love
these and a thousand more the fane adorn
their fates were painted ere the men were born
all copied from the heavens and ruling force
of the red star in his revolving course
the form of mars high on a chariot stood
all sheathd in arms and gruffly lookd the god


two geomantic figures were displayd
above his head a warrior and a maid
one when direct and one when retrograde


tired with deformities of death i haste
to the third temple of diana chaste
a sylvan scene with various greens was drawn
shades on the sides and in the midst a lawn
the silver cynthia with her nymphs around
pursued the flying deer the woods with horns resound
calisto there stood manifest of shame
and turnd a bear the northern star became
her son was next and by peculiar grace
in the cold circle held the second place
the stag acteon in the stream had spied
the naked huntress and for seeing died
his hounds unknowing of his change pursue
the chase and their mistaken master slew
peneian daphne too was there to see
apollos love before and now his tree
the adjoining fane the assembled greeks expressd
and hunting of the caledonian beast


oenides valour and his envied prize
the fatal power of atalantas eyes
dianas vengeance on the victor shown
the murderess mother and consuming son
the volscian queen extended on the plain
the treason punishd and the traitor slain
the rest were various huntings well designd
and savage beasts destroyd of every kind


the graceful goddess was arrayd in green
about her feet were little beagles seen
that watchd with upward eyes the motions of their queen


her legs were buskind and the left before
in act to shoot a silver bow she bore
and at her back a painted quiver wore


she trod a waxing moon that soon would wane
and drinking borrowd light be filld again
with downcast eyes as seeming to survey
the dark dominions her alternate sway
before her stood a women in her throes
and calld lucinas aid her burden to disclose
all these the painter drew with such command
that nature snatchd the pencil from his hand
ashamed and angry that his art could feign
and mend the tortures of a mothers pain
theseus beheld the fanes of every god
and thought his mighty cost was well bestowd
so princes now their poets should regard
but few can write and fewer can reward


the theatre thus raised the lists enclosed
and all with vast magnificence disposed
we leave the monarch pleased and haste to bring
the knights to combat and their arms to sing


the day approachd when fortune should decide
the important enterprise and give the bride
for now the rivals round the world had sought
and each his number well appointed brought
the nations far and near contend in choice
and send the flower of war by public voice
that after or before were never known
such chiefs as each an army seemd alone
beside the champions all of high degree
who knighthood loved and deeds of chivalry
throngd to the lists and envied to behold
the names of others not their own enrolld


nor seems it strange for every noble knight
who loves the fair and is endued with might
in such a quarrel would be proud to fight


there breathes not scarce a man on british ground
an isle for love and arms of old renownd
but would have sold his life to purchase fame
to palamon or arcite sent his name


and had the land selected of the best
half had come hence and let the world provide the rest
a hundred knights with palamon there came
approved in fight and men of mighty name
their arms were several as their nations were
but furnishd all alike with sword and spear
some wore coatarmour imitating scale
and next their skins were stubborn shirts of mail
some wore a breastplate and a light jupon
their horses clothed with rich caparison
some for defence would leathern bucklers use
of folded hides and others shields of pruce
one hung a poleaxe at his saddlebow
and one a heavy mace to stun the foe
one for his legs and knees provided well
with jambeaux armd and double plates of steel
this on his helmet wore a ladys glove
and that a sleeve embroiderd by his love


with palamon above the rest in place
lycurgus came the surly king of thrace
black was his beard and manly was his face


the balls of his broad eyes rolld in his head
and glared betwixt a yellow and a red
he lookd a lion with a gloomy stare
and oer his eyebrows hung his matted hair
bigboned and large of limbs with sinews strong
broadshoulderd and his arms were round and long
four milkwhite bulls the thracian use of old
were yoked to draw his car of burnishd gold
upright he stood and bore aloft his shield
conspicuous from afar and overlookd the field
his surcoat was a bearskin on his back
his hair hung long behind and glossy raven black
his ample forehead bore a coronet
with sparkling diamonds and with rubies set


ten brace and more of greyhounds snowy fair
and tall as stags ran loose and coursed around his chair
a match for pards in flight in grappling for the bear


with golden muzzles all their mouths were bound
and collars of the same their necks surround
thus through the fields lycurgus took his way
his hundred knights attend in pomp and proud array


to match this monarch with strong arcite came
emetrius king of ind a mighty name
on a bay courser goodly to behold
the trappings of his horse adornd with barbarous gold
not mars bestrod a steed with greater grace
his surcoat oer his arms was cloth of thrace
adornd with pearls all orient round and great
his saddle was of gold with emeralds set
his shoulders large a mantle did attire
with rubies thick and sparkling as the fire
his ambercolourd locks in ringlets run
with graceful negligence and shone against the sun
his nose was aquiline his eyes were blue
ruddy his lips and fresh and fair his hue
some sprinkled freckles on his face were seen
whose dusk set off the whiteness of the skill
his awful presence did the crowd surprise
nor durst the rash spectator meet his eyes
eyes that confessd him born for kingly sway
so fierce they flashd intolerable day
his age in natures youthful prime appeard
and just began to bloom his yellow beard
wheneer he spoke his voice was heard around
loud as a trumpet with a silver sound
a laurel wreathed his temples fresh and green
and myrtle sprigs the marks of love were mixd between
upon his fist he bore for his delight
an eagle well reclaimd and lily white


his hundred knights attend him to the war
all armd for battle save their heads were bare
words and devices blazed on every shield
and pleasing was the terror of the field


for kings and dukes and barons you might see
like sparkling stars though different in degree
all for the increase of arms and love of chivalry


before the king tame leopards led the way
and troops of lions innocently play
so bacchus through the conquerd indies rode
and beasts in gambols friskd before their honest god


in this array the war of either side
through athens passd with military pride
at prime they enterd on the sunday morn
rich tapestry spread the streets and flowers the posts adorn
the town was all a jubilee of feasts
so theseus willd in honour of his guests
himself with open arms the kings embraced
then all the rest in their degrees were graced
no harbinger was needful for the night
for every house was proud to lodge a knight


i pass the royal treat nor must relate
the gifts bestowd nor how the champions sate
who first who last or how the knights addressd
their vows or who was fairest at the feast
whose voice whose graceful dance did most surprise
soft amorous sighs and silent love of eyes
the rivals call my muse another way
to sing their vigils for the ensuing day


twas ebbing darkness past the noon of night
and phosphor on the confines of the light


promised the sun ere day began to spring
the tuneful lark already stretchd her wing
and flickering on her nest made short essays to sing


when wakeful palamon preventing day
took to the royal lists his early way
to venus at her fane in her own house to pray


there falling on his knees before her shrine
he thus implored with prayers her power divine


creator venus genial power of love
the bliss of men below and gods above
beneath the sliding sun thou runnst thy race
dost fairest shine and best become thy place
for thee the winds their eastern blasts forbear
thy month reveals the spring and opens all the year


thee goddess thee the storms of winter fly
earth smiles with flowers renewing laughs the sky
and birds to lays of love their tuneful notes apply


for thee the lion loathes the taste of blood
and roaring hunts his female through the wood
for thee the bulls rebellow through the groves
and tempt the stream and snuff their absent loves


tis thine whateer is pleasant good or fair
all nature is thy province life thy care
thou madest the world and dost the world repair


thou gladder of the mount of cytheron
increase of jove companion of the sun
if eer adonis touchd thy tender heart
have pity goddess for thou knowst the smart
alas i have not words to tell my grief
to vent my sorrow would be some relief
light sufferings give us leisure to complain
we groan but cannot speak in greater pain
o goddess tell thyself what i would say
thou knowst it and i feel too much to pray
so grant my suit as i enforce my might
in love to be thy champion and thy knight
a servant to thy sex a slave to thee
a foe professd to barren chastity
nor ask i fame or honour of the field
nor choose i more to vanquish than to yield
in my divine emilia make me blest
let fate or partial chance dispose the rest


find thou the manner and the means prepare
possession more than conquest is my care
mars is the warriors god in him it lies
on whom he favours to confer the prize
with smiling aspect you serenely move
in your fifth orb and rule the realm of love
the fates but only spin the coarser clue
the finest of the wool is left for you
spare me but one small portion of the twine
and let the sisters cut below your line
the rest among the rubbish may they sweep
or add it to the yarn of some old misers heap
but if you this ambitious prayer deny
a wish i grant beyond mortality
then let me sink beneath proud arcites arms
and i once dead let him possess her charms


thus ended he then with observance due
the sacred incense on her altar threw
the curling smoke mounts heavy from the fires
at length it catches flame and in a blaze expires
at once the gracious goddess gave the sign
her statue shook and trembled all the shrine
pleased palamon the tardy omen took
for since the flames pursued the trailing smoke
he knew his boon was granted but the day
to distance driven and joy adjournd with long delay


now morn with rosy light had streakd the sky
up rose the sun and up rose emily
addressd her early steps to cynthias fane
in state attended by her maiden train
who bore the vests that holy rites require
incense and odorous gums and coverd fire
the plenteous horns with pleasant mead they crown
nor wanted aught besides in honour of the moon
now while the temple smoked with hallowd steam
they wash the virgin in a living stream
the secret ceremonies i conceal
uncouth perhaps unlawful to reveal
but such they were as pagan use required
performd by women when the men retired
whose eyes profane their chaste mysterious rites
might turn to scandal or obscene delights
wellmeaners think no harm but for the rest
things sacred they pervert and silence is the best
her shining hair uncombd was loosely spread
a crown of mastless oak adornd her head
when to the shrine approachd the spotless maid
had kindling fires on either altar laid


the rites were such as were observed of old
by statius in his theban story told
then kneeling with her hands across her breast
thus lowly she preferrd her chaste request
oh goddess haunter of the woodland green
to whom both heaven and earth and seas are seen
queen of the nether skies where half the year
thy silver beams descend and light the gloomy sphere
goddess of maids and conscious of our hearts
so keep me from the vengeance of thy darts
which niobes devoted issue felt
when hissing through the skies the featherd deaths were dealt
as i desire to live a virgin life
nor know the name of mother or of wife
thy votress from my tender years i am
and love like thee the woods and sylvan game


like death thou knowst i loathe the nuptial state
and man the tyrant of our sex i hate
a lowly servant but a lofty mate


where love is duty on the female side
on theirs mere sensual gust and sought with surly pride
now by thy triple shape as thou art seen
in heaven earth hell and everywhere a queen
grant this my first desire let discord cease
and make betwixt the rivals lasting peace
quench their hot fire or far from me remove
the flame and turn it on some other love
or if my frowning stars have so decreed
that one must be rejected one succeed
make him my lord within whose faithful breast
is fixd my image and who loves me best
but oh even that avert i choose it not
but take it as the least unhappy lot
a maid i am and of thy virgin train
oh let me still that spotless name retain
frequent the forests thy chaste will obey
and only make the beasts of chase my prey


the flames ascend on either altar clear
while thus the blameless maid addressd her prayer
when lo the burning fire that shone so bright
flew off all sudden with extinguishd light
and left one altar dark a little space
which turnd selfkindled and renewd the blaze
the other victorflame a moment stood
then fell and lifeless left the extinguishd wood
for ever lost the irrevocable light
forsook the blackening coals and sunk to night


at either end it whistled as it flew
and as the brands were green so droppd the dew
infected as it fell with sweat of sanguine hue


the maid from that ill omen turnd her eyes
and with loud shrieks and clamours rent the skies
nor knew what signified the boding sign
but found the powers displeased and feard the wrath divine


then shook the sacred shrine and sudden light
sprung through the vaulted roof and made the temple bright


the power behold the power in glory shone
by her bent bow and her keen arrows known
the rest a huntress issuing from the wood
reclining on her cornel spear she stood
then gracious thus began dismiss thy fear
and heavens unchanged decrees attentive hear
more powerful gods have torn thee from my side
unwilling to resign and doomd a bride
the two contending knights are weighd above
one mars protects and one the queen of love
but which the man is in the thunderers breast
this he pronounced tis he who loves thee best
the fire that once extinct revived again
foreshows the love allotted to remain
farewell she said and vanishd from the place
the sheaf of arrows shook and rattled in the case
aghast at this the royal virgin stood
disclaimd and now no more a sister of the wood


but to the parting goddess thus she prayd
propitious still be present to my aid
nor quite abandon your once favourd maid


then sighing she returnd but smiled betwixt
with hopes and fears and joys with sorrows mixd


the next returning planetary hour
of mars who shared the heptarchy of power
his steps bold arcite to the temple bent
to adore with pagan rites the power armipotent
then prostrate low before his altar lay
and raised his manly voice and thus began to pray


strong god of arms whose iron sceptre sways
the freezing north and hyperborean seas
and scythian colds and thracias wintry coast
where stand thy steeds and thou art honourd most
there most but everywhere thy power is known
the fortune of the fight is all thy own
terror is thine and wild amazement flung
from out thy chariot withers even the strong
and disarray and shameful rout ensue
and force is added to the fainting crew
acknowledged as thou art accept my prayer
if aught i have achieved deserve thy care


if to my utmost power with sword and shield
i dared the death unknowing how to yield
and falling in my rank still kept the field


then let my arms prevail by thee sustaind
that emily by conquest may be gaind
have pity on my pains nor those unknown
to mars which when a lover were his own
venus the public care of all above
thy stubborn heart has softend into love
now by her blandishments and powerful charms
when yielded she lay curling in thy arms
even by thy shame if shame it may be calld
when vulcan had thee in his net enthralld
oh envied ignominy sweet disgrace
when every god that saw thee wishd thy place
by those dear pleasures aid my arms in fight
and make me conquer in my patrons right
for i am young a novice in the trade
the fool of love unpractised to persuade
and want the soothing arts that catch the fair
but caught myself lie struggling in the snare
and she i love or laughs at all my pain
or knows her worth too well and pays me with disdain
for sure i am unless i win in arms
to stand excluded from emilias charms
nor can my strength avail unless by thee
endued with force i gain the victory


then for the fire which warmd thy generous heart
pity thy subjects pains and equal smart
so be the morrows sweat and labour mine
the palm and honour of the conquest thine
then shall the war and stern debate and strife
immortal be the business of my life
and in thy fane the dusty spoils among
high on the burnishd roof my banner shall be hung
rankd with my champions bucklers and below
with arms reversed the achievements of my foe
and while these limbs the vital spirit feeds
while day to night and night to day succeeds
thy smoking altar shall be fat with food
of incense and the grateful steam of blood
burntofferings morn and evening shall be thine
and fires eternal in thy temple shine
the bush of yellow beard this length of hair
which from my birth inviolate i bear
guiltless of steel and from the razor free
shall fall a plenteous crop reserved for thee
so may my arms with victory be blest
i ask no more let fate dispose the rest


the champion ceased there followd in the close
a hollow groan a murmuring wind arose
the rings of iron that on the doors were hung
sent out a jarring sound and harshly rung
the bolted gates flew open at the blast
the storm rushd in and arcite stood aghast
the flames were blown aside yet shone they bright
fannd by the wind and gave a ruffled light
then from the ground a scent began to rise
sweet smelling as accepted sacrifice
this omen pleased and as the flames aspire
with odorous incense arcite heaps the fire
nor wanted hymns to mars or heathen charms
at length the nodding statue clashd his arms
and with a sullen sound and feeble cry
half sunk and half pronounced the word of victory
for this with soul devout he thankd the god
and of success secure returnd to his abode


these vows thus granted raised a strife above
betwixt the god of war and queen of love
she granting first had right of time to plead
but he had granted too nor would recede
jove was for venus but he feard his wife
and seemd unwilling to decide the strife
till saturn from his leaden throne arose
and found a way the difference to compose
though sparing of his grace to mischief bent
he seldom does a good with good intent
wayward but wise by long experience taught
to please both parties for ill ends he sought
for this advantage age from youth has won
as not to be outridden though outrun
by fortune he was now to venus trined
and with stern mars in capricorn was joind


of him disposing in his own abode
he soothed the goddess while he gulld the god
cease daughter to complain and stint the strife
thy palamon shall have his promised wife
and mars the lord of conquest in the fight
with palm and laurel shall adorn his knight
wide is my course nor turn i to my place
till length of time and move with tardy pace
man feels me when i press the ethereal plains
my hand is heavy and the wound remains
mine is the shipwreck in a watery sign
and in an earthy the dark dungeon mine


cold shivering agues melancholy care
and bitter blasting winds and poisond air
are mine and wilful death resulting from despair


the throttling quinsey tis my star appoints
and rheumatisms ascend to rack the joints
when churls rebel against their native prince
i arm their hands and furnish the pretence


and housing in the lions hateful sign
bought senates and deserting troops are mine
mine is the privy poisoning i command
unkindly seasons and ungrateful land
by me kings palaces are pushd to ground
and miners crushd beneath their mines are found
twas i slew samson when the pillard hall
fell down and crushd the many with the fall
my looking is the sire of pestilence
that sweeps at once the people and the prince
now weep no more but trust thy grandsires art
mars shall be pleased and thou perform thy part
tis ill though different your complexions are
the family of heaven for men should war
the expedient pleased where neither lost his right
mars had the day and venus had the night
the management they left to chronos care
now turn we to the effect and sing the war


in athens all was pleasure mirth and play
all proper to the spring and spritely may
which every soul inspired with such delight
twas jesting all the day and love at night
heaven smiled and gladded was the heart of man
and venus had the world as when it first began
at length in sleep their bodies they compose
and dreamt the future fight and early rose


now scarce the dawning day began to spring
as at a signal given the streets with clamours ring


at once the crowd arose confused and high
even from the heaven was heard a shouting cry
for mars was early up and roused the sky


the gods came downward to behold the wars
sharpening their sights and leaning from their stars
the neighing of the generous horse was heard
for battle by the busy groom prepared
rustling of harness rattling of the shield
clattering of armour furbishd for the field
crowds to the castle mounted up the street
battering the pavement with their coursers feet


the greedy sight might there devour the gold
of glittering arms too dazzling to behold
and polishd steel that cast the view aside
and crested morions with their plumy pride
knights with a long retinue of their squires
in gaudy liveries march and quaint attires
one laced the helm another held the lance
a third the shining buckler did advance
the courser pawd the ground with restless feet
and snorting foamd and champd the golden bit


the smiths and armourers on palfreys ride
files in their hands and hammers at their side
and nails for loosend spears and thongs for shields provide


the yeomen guard the streets in seemly bands
and clowns come crowding on with cudgels in their hands


the trumpets next the gate in order placed
attend the sign to sound the martial blast
the palaceyard is filld with floating tides
and the last comers bear the former to the sides
the throng is in the midst the common crew
shut out the hall admits the better few
in knots they stand or in a rank they walk
serious in aspect earnest in their talk
factious and favouring this or the other side
as their strong fancy or weak reason guide
their wagers back their wishes numbers hold
with the fair freckled king and beard of gold
so vigorous are his eyes such rays they cast
so prominent his eagles beak is placed
but most their looks on the black monarch bend
his rising muscles and his brawn commend
his doublebiting axe and beamy spear
each asking a gigantic force to rear
all spoke as partial favour moved the mind
and safe themselves at others cost divined


waked by the cries the athenian chief arose
the knightly forms of combat to dispose
and passing through the obsequious guards he sate
conspicuous on a throne sublime in state
there for the two contending knights he sent
armd capapie with reverence low they bent
he smiled on both and with superior look
alike their offerd adoration took
the people press on every side to see
their awful prince and hear his high decree
then signing to their heralds with his hand
they gave his orders from their lofty stand
silence is thrice enjoind then thus aloud
the kingatarms bespeaks the knights and listening crowd


our sovereign lord has ponderd in his mind
the means to spare the blood of gentle kind
and of his grace and inborn clemency
he modifies his first severe decree
the keener edge of battle to rebate
the troops for honour fighting not for hate
he wills not death should terminate their strife
and wounds if wounds ensue be short of life
but issues ere the fight his dread command
that slings afar and poniards hand to hand
be banishd from the field that none shall dare
with shortend sword to stab in closer war
but in fair combat fight with manly strength
nor push with biting point but strike at length


the tourney is allowd but one career
of the tough ash with the sharpgrinded spear
but knights unhorsed may rise from off the plain
and fight on foot their honour to regain
nor if at mischief taken on the ground
be slain but prisoners to the pillar bound
at either barrier placed nor captives made
be freed or armd anew the fight invade
the chief of either side bereft of life
or yielded to his foe concludes the strife
thus dooms the lord now valiant knights and young
fight each his fill with swords and maces long


the herald ends the vaulted firmament
with loud acclaims and vast applause is rent
heaven guard a prince so gracious and so good
so just and yet so provident of blood
this was the general cry the trumpets sound
and warlike symphony is heard around
the marching troops through athens take their way
the great earlmarshal orders their array
the fair from high the passing pomp behold
a rain of flowers is from the windows rolld
the casements are with golden tissue spread
and horses hoofs for earth on silken tapestry tread
the king goes midmost and the rivals ride
in equal rank and close his either side


next after these there rode the royal wife
with emily the cause and the reward of strife
the following cavalcade by three and three
proceed by titles marshalld in degree
thus through the southern gate they take their way
and at the list arrived ere prime of day
there parting from the king the chiefs divide
and wheeling east and west before their many ride
the athenian monarch mounts his throne on high
and after him the queen and emily
next these the kindred of the crown are graced
with nearer seats and lords by ladies placed
scarce were they seated when with clamours loud
in rushd at once a rude promiscuous crowd
the guards and then each other overbear
and in a moment throng the spacious theatre
now changed the jarring noise to whispers low
as winds forsaking seas more softly blow
when at the western gate on which the car
is placed aloft that bears the god of war
proud arcite entering armd before his train
stops at the barrier and divides the plain
red was his banner and displayd abroad
the bloody colours of his patron god


at that self moment enters palamon
the gate of venus and the rising sun
waved by the wanton winds his banner flies
all maiden white and shares the peoples eyes
from east to west look all the world around
two troops so matchd were never to be found
such bodies built for strength of equal age
in stature sized so proud in equipage
the nicest eye could no distinction make
where lay the advantage or what side to take


thus ranged the herald for the last proclaims
a silence while they answerd to their names
for so the king decreed to shun the care
the fraud of musters false the common bane of war
the tale was just and then the gates were closed
and chief to chief and troop to troop opposed
the heralds last retired and loudly cried
the fortune of the field be fairly tried


at this the challenger with fierce defy
his trumpet sounds the challenged makes reply
with clangour rings the field resounds the vaulted sky


their vizors closed their lances in the rest
or at the helmet pointed or the crest
they vanish from the barrier speed the race
and spurring see decrease the middle space
a cloud of smoke envelops either host
and all at once the combatants are lost
darkling they join adverse and shock unseen
coursers with coursers jostling men with men
as labouring in eclipse a while they stay
till the next blast of wind restores the day
they look anew the beauteous form of fight
is changed and war appears a grisly sight
two troops in fair array one moment showd
the next a field with fallen bodies strowd
not half the number in their seats are found
but men and steeds lie grovelling on the ground
the points of spears are stuck within the shield
the steeds without their riders scour the field
the knights unhorsed on foot renew the fight
the glittering falchions cast a gleaming light
hauberks and helms are hewd with many a wound
out spins the streaming blood and dyes the ground


the mighty maces with such haste descend
they break the bones and make the solid armour bend
this thrusts amid the throng with furious force
down goes at once the horseman and the horse
that courser stumbles on the fallen steed
and floundering throws the rider oer his head
one rolls along a football to his foes
one with a broken truncheon deals his blows
this halting this disabled with his wound
in triumph led is to the pillar bound
where by the kings award he must abide
there goes a captive led on the other side
by fits they cease and leaning on the lance
take breath a while and to new fight advance


full oft the rivals met and neither spared
his utmost force and each forgot to ward
the head of this was to the saddle bent
the other backward to the crupper sent
both were by turns unhorsed the jealous blows
fall thick and heavy when on foot they close
so deep their falchions bite that every stroke
pierced to the quick and equal wounds they gave and took
borne far asunder by the tides of men
like adamant and steel they meet again


so when a tiger sucks the bullocks blood
a famishd lion issuing from the wood
roars lordly fierce and challenges the food


each claims possession neither will obey
but both their paws are fastend on the prey
they bite they tear and while in vain they strive
the swains come armd between and both to distance drive


at length as fate foredoomd and all things tend
by course of time to their appointed end
so when the sun to west was far declined
and both afresh in mortal battle joind
the strong emetrius came in arcites aid
and palamon with odds was overlaid
for turning short he struck with all his might
full on the helmet of the unwary knight
deep was the wound he staggerd with the blow
and turnd him to his unexpected foe
whom with such force he struck he felld him down
and cleft the circle of his golden crown
but arcites men who now prevaild in fight
twice ten at once surround the single knight
oerpowerd at length they force him to the ground
unyielded as he was and to the pillar bound
and king lycurgus while he fought in vain
his friend to free was tumbled on the plain


who now laments but palamon compelld
no more to try the fortune of the field
and worse than death to view with hateful eyes
his rivals conquest and renounce the prize


the royal judge on his tribunal placed
who had beheld the fight from first to last
bade cease the war pronouncing from on high
arcite of thebes had won the beauteous emily


the sound of trumpets to the voice replied
and round the royal lists the heralds cried
arcite of thebes has won the beauteous bride


the people rend the skies with vast applause
all own the chief when fortune owns the cause
arcite is ownd even by the gods above
and conquering mars insults the queen of love
so laughd he when the rightful titan faild
and joves usurping arms in heaven prevaild
laughd all the powers who favour tyranny
and all the standing army of the sky
but venus with dejected eyes appears
and weeping on the lists distilld her tears
her will refused which grieves a woman most
and in her champion foild the cause of love is lost
till saturn said fair daughter now be still
the blustering fool has satisfied his will
his boon is given his knight has gaind the day
but lost the prize the arrears are yet to pay
thy hour is come and mine the care shall be
to please thy knight and set thy promise free


now while the heralds run the lists around
and arcite arcite heaven and earth resound
a miracle nor less it could be calld
their joy with unexpected sorrow palld
the victor knight had laid his helm aside
part for his ease the greater part for pride
bareheaded popularly low he bowd
and paid the salutations of the crowd
then spurring at full speed ran endlong on
where theseus sate on his imperial throne
furious he drove and upward cast his eye
where next the queen was placed his emily
then passing to the saddlebow he bent
a sweet regard the gracious virgin lent
for women to the brave an easy prey
still follow fortune where she leads the way


just then from earth sprung out a flashing fire
by pluto sent at saturns bad desire
the startling steed was seized with sudden fright
and bounding oer the pommel cast the knight
forward he flew and pitching on his head
he quiverd with his feet and lay for dead
black was his countenance in a little space
for all the blood was gatherd in his face
help was at hand they reard him from the ground
and from his cumbrous arms his limbs unbound
then lanced a vein and watchd returning breath
it came but cloggd with symptoms of his death
the saddlebow the noble parts had pressd
all bruised and mortified his manly breast
him still entranced and in a litter laid
they bore from field and to his bed conveyd
at length he waked and with a feeble cry
the word he first pronounced was emily


mean time the king though inwardly he mournd
in pomp triumphant to the town returnd
attended by the chiefs who fought the field
now friendly mixd and in one troop compelld
composed his looks to counterfeited cheer
and bade them not for arcites life to fear
but that which gladded all the warrior train
though most were sorely wounded none were slain
the surgeons soon despoild them of their arms
and some with salves they cure and some with charms
foment the bruises and the pains assuage
and heal their inward hurts with sovereign draughts of sage
the king in person visits all around
comforts the sick congratulates the sound
honours the princely chiefs rewards the rest
and holds for thrice three days a royal feast
none was disgraced for falling is no shame
and cowardice alone is loss of fame
the venturous knight is from the saddle thrown
but tis the fault of fortune not his own
if crowds and palms the conquering side adorn
the victor under better stars was born
the brave man seeks not popular applause
nor overpowerd with arms deserts his cause
unshamed though foild he does the best he can
force is of brutes but honour is of man


thus theseus smiled on all with equal grace
and each was set according to his place
with ease were reconciled the differing parts
for envy never dwells in noble hearts
at length they took their leave the time expired
well pleased and to their several homes retired


mean while the health of arcite still impairs
from bad proceeds to worse and mocks the leechs cares
swoln is his breast his inward pains increase
all means are used and all without success
the clotted blood lies heavy on his heart
corrupts and there remains in spite of art
nor breathing veins nor cupping will prevail
all outward remedies and inward fail
the mould of natures fabric is destroyd
her vessels discomposed her virtue void


the bellows of his lungs begin to swell
all out of frame is every secret cell
nor can the good receive nor bad expel


those breathing organs thus within oppressd
with venom soon distend the sinews of his breast
nought profits him to save abandond life
nor vomits upward aid nor downward laxative
the midmost region batterd and destroyd
when nature cannot work the effect of art is void
for physic can but mend our crazy state
patch an old building not a new create
arcite is doomd to die in all his pride
must leave his youth and yield his beauteous bride
gaind hardly against right and unenjoyd
when twas declared all hope of life was past
conscience that of all physic works the last
caused him to send for emily in haste
with her at his desire came palamon
then on his pillow raised he thus begun


no language can express the smallest part
of what i feel and suffer in my heart
for you whom best i love and value most
but to your service i bequeath my ghost
which from this mortal body when untied
unseen unheard shall hover at your side
nor fright you waking nor your sleep offend
but wait officious and your steps attend
how i have loved excuse my faltering tongue
my spirits feeble and my pains are strong
this i may say i only grieve to die
because i lose my charming emily
to die when heaven had put you in my power
fate could not choose a more malicious hour
what greater curse could envious fortune give
than just to die when i began to live


vain men how vanishing a bliss we crave
now warm in love now withering in the grave
never oh never more to see the sun
still dark in a damp vault and still alone
this fate is common but i lose my breath
near bliss and yet not blessd before my death
farewell but take me dying in your arms
tis all i can enjoy of all your charms
this hand i cannot but in death resign
ah could i live but while i live tis mine
i feel my end approach and thus embraced
am pleased to die but hear me speak my last
ah my sweet foe for you and you alone
i broke my faith with injured palamon
but love the sense of right and wrong confounds
strong love and proud ambition have no bounds
and much i doubt should heaven my life prolong
i should return to justify my wrong


for while my former flames remain within
repentance is but want of power to sin
with mortal hatred i pursued his life
nor he nor you were guilty of the strife
nor i but as i loved yet all combined
your beauty and my impotence of mind
and his concurrent flame that blew my fire
for still our kindred souls had one desire
he had a moments right in point of time
had i seen first then his had been the crime
fate made it mine and justified his right
nor holds this earth a more deserving knight
for virtue valour and for noble blood
truth honour all that is comprised in good
so help me heaven in all the world is none
so worthy to be loved as palamon
he loves you too with such an holy fire
as will not cannot but with life expire
our vowd affections both have often tried
nor any love but yours could ours divide
then by my loves inviolable band
by my long suffering and my short command
if eer you plight your vows when i am gone
have pity on the faithful palamon


this was his last for death came on amain
and exercised below his iron reign
then upward to the seat of life he goes
sense fled before him what he touchd he froze
yet could he not his closing eyes withdraw
though less and less of emily he saw
so speechless for a little space he lay
then graspd the hand he held and sighd his soul away


but whither went his soul let such relate
who search the secrets of the future state
divines can say but what themselves believe
strong proofs they have but not demonstrative
for were all plain then all sides must agree
and faith itself be lost in certainty
to live uprightly then is sure the best
to save ourselves and not to damn the rest
the soul of arcite went where heathens go
who better live than we though less they know


in palamon a manly grief appears
silent he wept ashamed to show his tears
emilia shriekd but once and then oppressd
with sorrow sunk upon her lovers breast
till theseus in his arms conveyd with care
far from so sad a sight the swooning fair


twere loss of time her sorrow to relate
ill bears the sex a youthful lovers fate
when just approaching to the nuptial state


but like a lowhung cloud it rains so fast
that all at once it falls and cannot last
the face of things is changed and athens now
that laughd so late becomes the scene of woe
matrons and maids both sexes every state
with tears lament the knights untimely fate
nor greater grief in falling troy was seen
for hectors death but hector was not then
old men with dust deformd their hoary hair
the women beat their breasts their cheeks they tear
why wouldst thou go with one consent they cry
when thou hadst gold enough and emily


theseus himself who should have cheerd the grief
of others wanted now the same relief
old egeus only could revive his son
who various changes of the world had known
and strange vicissitudes of human fate
still altering never in a steady state
good after ill and after pain delight
alternate like the scenes of day and night
since every man who lives is born to die
and none can boast sincere felicity
with equal mind what happens let us bear
nor joy nor grieve too much for things beyond our care
like pilgrims to the appointed place we tend
the worlds an inn and death the journeys end
even kings but play and when their part is done
some other worse or better mount the throne
with words like these the crowd was satisfied
and so they would have been had theseus died


but he their king was labouring in his mind
a fitting place for funeral pomps to find
which were in honour of the dead designd


and after long debate at last he found
as love itself had markd the spot of ground
that grove for ever green that conscious laund
where he with palamon fought hand to hand
that where he fed his amorous desires
with soft complaints and felt his hottest fires
there other flames might waste his earthly part
and burn his limbs where love had burnd his heart


this once resolved the peasants were enjoind
serewood and firs and dodderd oaks to find
with sounding axes to the grove they go
fell split and lay the fuel on a row
vulcanian food a bier is next prepared
on which the lifeless body should be reard
coverd with cloth of gold on which was laid
the corpse of arcite in like robes arrayd
white gloves were on his hands and on his head
a wreath of laurel mixd with myrtle spread
a sword keenedged within his right he held
the warlike emblem of the conquerd field
bare was his manly visage on the bier
menaced his countenance even in death severe
then to the palacehall they bore the knight
to lie in solemn state a public sight
groans cries and howlings fill the crowded place
and unaffected sorrow sate on every face


sad palamon above the rest appears
in sable garments dewd with gushing tears
his auburn locks on either shoulder flowd
which to the funeral of his friend he vowd
but emily as chief was next his side
a virginwidow and a mourning bride
and that the princely obsequies might be
performd according to his high degree


the steed that bore him living to the fight
was trappd with polishd steel all shining bright
and coverd with the achievements of the knight


the riders rode abreast and one his shield
his lance of cornelwood another held
the third his bow and glorious to behold
the costly quiver all of burnishd gold
the noblest of the grecians next appear
and weeping on their shoulders bore the bier
with sober pace they marchd and often stayd
and through the masterstreet the corpse conveyd
the houses to their tops with black were spread
and even the pavements were with mourning hid
the right side of the pall old egeus kept
and on the left the royal theseus wept
each bore a golden bowl of work divine
with honey filld and milk and mixd with ruddy wine
then palamon the kinsman of the slain
and after him appeard the illustrious train
to grace the pomp came emily the bright
with coverd fire the funeral pile to light
with high devotion was the service made
and all the rites of pagan honour paid
so lofty was the pile a parthian bow
with vigour drawn must send the shaft below


the bottom was full twenty fathom broad
with crackling straw beneath in due proportion strewd
the fabric seemd a wood of rising green
with sulphur and bitumen cast between
to feed the flames the trees were unctuous fir
and mountainash the mother of the spear
the mourneryew and builder oak were there
the beech the swimming alder and the plane
hard box and linden of a softer grain
and laurels which the gods for conquering chiefs ordain
how they were rankd shall rest untold by me
with nameless nymphs that lived in every tree
nor how the dryads or the woodland train
disherited ran howling oer the plain
nor how the birds to foreign seats repaird
or beasts that bolted out and saw the forest bared
nor how the ground now cleard with ghastly fright
beheld the sudden sun a stranger to the light


the straw as first i said was laid below
of chips and serewood was the second row
the third of greens and timber newly felld
the fourth high stage the fragrant odours held
and pearls and precious stones and rich array
in midst of which embalmd the body lay
the service sung the maid with mourning eyes
the stubble fired the smouldering flames arise
this office done she sunk upon the ground
but what she spoke recoverd from her swound
i want the wit in moving words to dress
but by themselves the tender sex may guess
while the devouring fire was burning fast
rich jewels in the flame the wealthy cast


and some their shields and some their lances threw
and gave their warriors ghost a warriors due


full bowls of wine of honey milk and blood
were pourd upon the pile of burning wood
and hissing flames receive and hungry lick the food


then thrice the mounted squadrons ride around
the fire and arcites name they thrice resound
hail and farewell they shouted thrice amain
thrice facing to the left and thrice they turnd again
still as they turnd they beat their clattering shields
the women mix their cries and clamour fills the fields
the warlike wakes continued all the night
and funeral games were playd at new returning light
who naked wrestled best besmeard with oil
or who with gauntlets gave or took the foil
i will not tell you nor would you attend
but briefly haste to my long storys end


i pass the rest the year was fully mournd
and palamon long since to thebes returned
when by the grecians general consent
at athens theseus held his parliament
among the laws that passd it was decreed
that conquerd thebes from bondage should be freed
reserving homage to the athenian throne
to which the sovereign summond palamon
unknowing of the cause he took his way
mournful in mind and still in black array


the monarch mounts the throne and placed on high
commands into the court the beauteous emily
so calld she came the senate rose and paid
becoming reverence to the royal maid
and first soft whispers through the assembly went
with silent wonder then they watchd the event
all hushd the king arose with awful grace
deep thought was in his breast and counsel in his face
at length he sighd and having first prepared
the attentive audience thus his will declared


the cause and spring of motion from above
hung down on earth the golden chain of love
great was the effect and high was his intent
when peace among the jarring seeds he sent
fire flood and earth and air by this were bound
and love the common link the new creation crownd
the chain still holds for though the forms decay
eternal matter never wears away
the same first mover certain bounds has placed
how long those perishable forms shall last
nor can they last beyond the time assignd
by that allseeing and allmaking mind
shorten their hours they may for will is free
but never pass the appointed destiny
so men oppressd when weary of their breath
throw off the burden and suborn their death
then since those forms begin and have their end
on some unalterd cause they sure depend
parts of the whole are we but god the whole
who gives us life and animating soul
for nature cannot from a part derive
that being which the whole can only give
he perfect stable but imperfect we
subject to change and different in degree
plants beasts and man and as our organs are
we more or less of his perfection share


but by a long descent the ethereal fire
corrupts and forms the mortal part expire
as he withdraws his virtue so they pass
and the same matter makes another mass
this law the omniscient power was pleased to give
that every kind should by succession live
that individuals die his will ordains
the propagated species still remains
the monarch oak the patriarch of the trees
shoots rising up and spreads by slow degrees
three centuries he grows and three he stays
supreme in state and in three more decays
so wears the paving pebble in the street
and towns and towers their fatal periods meet
so rivers rapid once now naked lie
forsaken of their springs and leave their channels dry
so man at first a drop dilates with heat
then formd the little heart begins to beat
secret he feeds unknowing in the cell
at length for hatching ripe he breaks the shell
and struggles into breath and cries for aid
then helpless in his mothers lap is laid
he creeps he walks and issuing into man
grudges their life from whence his own began


reckless of laws affects to rule alone
anxious to reign and restless on the throne
first vegetive then feels and reasons last
rich of three souls and lives all three to waste
some thus but thousands more in flower of age
for few arrive to run the latter stage
sunk in the first in battle some are slain
and others whelmd beneath the stormy main
what makes all this but jupiter the king
at whose command we perish and we spring
then tis our best since thus ordaind to die
to make a virtue of necessity
take what he gives since to rebel is vain
the bad grows better which we well sustain
and could we choose the time and choose aright
tis best to die our honour at the height
when we have done our ancestors no shame
but served our friends and well secured our fame
then should we wish our happy life to close
and leave no more for fortune to dispose
so should we make our death a glad relief
from future shame from sickness and from grief
enjoying while we live the present hour
and dying in our excellence and flower
then round our deathbed every friend should run
and joyous of our conquest early won


while the malicious world with envious tears
should grudge our happy end and wish it theirs


since then our arcite is with honour dead
why should we mourn that he so soon is freed
or call untimely what the gods decreed


with grief as just a friend may be deplored
from a foul prison to free air restored
ought he to thank his kinsman or his wife
could tears recall him into wretched life
their sorrow hurts themselves on him is lost
and worse than both offends his happy ghost
what then remains but after past annoy
to take the good vicissitude of joy
to thank the gracious gods for what they give
possess our souls and while we live to live
ordain we then two sorrows to combine
and in one point the extremes of grief to join
that thence resulting joy may be renewd
as jarring notes in harmony conclude
then i propose that palamon shall be
in marriage joind with beauteous emily


for which already i have gaind the assent
of my free people in full parliament
long love to her has borne the faithful knight
and well deserved had fortune done him right
tis time to mend her fault since emily
by arcites death from former vows is free
if you fair sister ratify the accord
and take him for your husband and your lord
tis no dishonour to confer your grace
on one descended from a royal race
and were he less yet years of service past
from grateful souls exact reward at last
pity is heavens and yours nor can she find
a throne so soft as in a womans mind
he said she blushd and as oerawed by might
seemd to give theseus what she gave the knight
then turning to the theban thus he said
small arguments are needful to persuade


your temper to comply with my command
and speaking thus he gave emilias hand


smiled venus to behold her own true knight
obtain the conquest though he lost the fight
and blessd with nuptial bliss the sweet laborious night


eros and anteros on either side
one fired the bridegroom and one warmd the bride
and longattending hymen from above
showerd on the bed the whole idalian grove
all of a tenor was their afterlife
no day discolourd with domestic strife
no jealousy but mutual truth believed
secure repose and kindness undeceived
thus heaven beyond the compass of his thought
sent him the blessing he so dearly bought


so may the queen of love long duty bless
and all true lovers find the same success


there lived as authors tell in days of yore
a widow somewhat old and very poor
deep in a cell her cottage lonely stood
well thatchd and under covert of a wood
this dowager on whom my tale i found
since last she laid her husband in the ground
a simple sober life in patience led
and had but just enough to buy her bread
but huswifing the little heaven had lent
she duly paid a groat for quarter rent
and pinchd her belly with her daughters two
to bring the year about with much ado


the cattle in her homestead were three sows
a ewe calld mally and three brinded cows
her parlourwindow stuck with herbs around
of savoury smell and rushes strewd the ground
a mappledresser in her hall she had
on which full many a slender meal she made
for no delicious morsel passd her throat
according to her cloth she cut her coat
no poignant sauce she knew nor costly treat
her hunger gave a relish to her meat
a sparing diet did her health assure
or sick a pepper posset was her cure
before the day was done her work she sped
and never went by candlelight to bed
with exercise she sweat ill humours out
her dancing was not hindered by the gout
her poverty was glad her heart content
nor knew she what the spleen or vapours meant
of wine she never tasted through the year
but white and black was all her homely cheer
brown bread and milk but first she skimmd her bowls
and rashers of singed bacon on the coals
on holy days an egg or two at most
but her ambition never reachd to roast


a yard she had with pales enclosed about
some high some low and a dry ditch without
within this homestead lived without a peer
for crowing loud the noble chanticleer
so hight her cock whose singing did surpass
the merry notes of organs at the mass
more certain was the crowing of the cock
to number hours than is an abbeyclock
and sooner than the matinbell was rung
he clappd his wings upon his roost and sung
for when degrees fifteen ascended right
by sure instinct he knew twas one at night
high was his comb and coralred withal
in dents embattled like a castle wall
his bill was ravenblack and shone like jet
blue were his legs and orient were his feet
white were his nails like silver to behold
his body glittering like the burnishd gold
this gentle cock for solace of his life
six misses had besides his lawful wife
scandal that spares no king though neer so good
says they were all of his own flesh and blood
his sisters both by sire and mothers side
and sure their likeness showd them near allied
but make the worst the monarch did no more
than all the ptolemys had done before
when incest is for interest of a nation
tis made no sin by holy dispensation
some lines have been maintaind by this alone
which by their common ugliness are known


but passing this as from our tale apart
dame partlet was the sovereign of his heart
ardent in love outrageous in his play
he featherd her a hundred times a day
and she that was not only passing fair
but was with all discreet and debonair
resolved the passive doctrine to fulfil
though loth and let him work his wicked will


at board and bed was affable and kind
according as their marriage vow did bind
and as the churchs precept had enjoind


even since she was a seennight old they say
was chaste and humble to her dying day
nor chick nor hen was known to disobey


by this her husbands heart she did obtain
what cannot beauty joind with virtue gain
she was his only joy and he her pride
she when he walkd went pecking by his side
if spurning up the ground he sprung a corn
the tribute in his bill to her was borne
but oh what joy it was to hear him sing
in summer when the day began to spring
stretching his neck and warbling in his throat
_solus cum sola_ then was all his note
for in the days of yore the birds of parts
were bred to speak and sing and learn the liberal arts


it happd that perching on the parlourbeam
amidst his wives he had a deadly dream
just at the dawn and sighd and groand so fast
as every breath he drew would be his last
dame partlet ever nearest to his side
heard all his piteous moan and how he cried
for help from gods and men and sore aghast
she peckd and pulld and wakend him at last
dear heart said she for love of heaven declare
your pain and make me partner in your care
you groan sir ever since the morninglight
as something had disturbd your noble sprite


and madam well i might said chanticleer
never was shrovetide cock in such a fear
even still i run all over in a sweat
my princely senses not recoverd yet
for such a dream i had of dire portent
that much i fear my body will be shent
it bodes i shall have wars and woful strife
or in a loathsome dungeon end my life


know dame i dreamt within my troubled breast
that in our yard i saw a murderous beast
that on my body would have made arrest


with waking eyes i neer beheld his fellow
his colour was betwixt a red and yellow
tippd was his tail and both his pricking ears
were black and much unlike his other hairs
the rest in shape a beagles whelp throughout
with broader forehead and a sharper snout
deep in his front were sunk his glowing eyes
that yet methinks i see him with surprise
reach out your hand i drop with clammy sweat
and lay it to my heart and feel it beat
now fie for shame quoth she by heaven above
thou hast for ever lost thy ladys love
no woman can endure a recreant knight
he must be bold by day and free by night
our sex desires a husband or a friend
who can our honour and his own defend
wise hardy secret liberal of his purse
a fool is nauseous but a coward worse
no bragging coxcomb yet no baffled knight
how darest thou talk of love and darest not fight
how darest thou tell thy dame thou art affeard
hast thou no manly heart and hast a beard


if aught from fearful dreams may be divined
they signify a cock of dunghill kind
all dreams as in old galen i have read
are from repletion and complexion bred
from rising fumes of indigested food
and noxious humours that infect the blood
and sure my lord if i can read aright
these foolish fancies you have had tonight
are certain symptoms in the canting style
of boiling choler and abounding bile
this yellow gall that in your stomach floats
engenders all these visionary thoughts
when choler overflows then dreams are bred
of flames and all the family of red
red dragons and red beasts in sleep we view
for humours are distinguishd by their hue
from hence we dream of wars and warlike things
and wasps and hornets with their double wings


choler adust congeals our blood with fear
then black bulls toss us and black devils tear
in sanguine airy dreams aloft we bound
with rheums oppressd we sink in rivers drownd
more i could say but thus conclude my theme
the dominating humour makes the dream
cato was in his time accounted wise
and he condemns them all for empty lies


take my advice and when we fly to ground
with laxatives preserve your body sound
and purge the peccant humours that abound


i should be loath to lay you on a bier
and though there lives no pothecary near
i dare for once prescribe for your disease
and save long bills and a damnd doctors fees
two sovereign herbs which i by practice know
and both at hand for in our yard they grow
on peril of my soul shall rid you wholly
of yellow choler and of melancholy
you must both purge and vomit but obey
and for the love of heaven make no delay


since hot and dry in your complexion join
beware the sun when in a vernal sign
for when he mounts exalted in the ram
if then he finds your body in a flame
replete with choler i dare lay a groat
a tertian ague is at least your lot
perhaps a fever which the gods forefend
may bring your youth to some untimely end
and therefore sir as you desire to live
a day or two before your laxative
take just three worms nor under nor above
because the gods unequal numbers love
these digestives prepare you for your purge
of fumetory centaury and spurge
and of ground ivy add a leaf or two
all which within our yard or garden grow
eat these and be my lord of better cheer
your fathers son was never born to fear


madam quoth he gramercy for your care
but cato whom you quoted you may spare
tis true a wise and worthy man he seems
and as you say gave no belief to dreams
but other men of more authority
and by the immortal powers as wise as he
maintain with sounder sense that dreams forebode
for homer plainly says they come from god
nor cato said it but some modern fool
imposed in catos name on boys at school
believe me madam morning dreams foreshow
the events of things and future weal or woe
some truths are not by reason to be tried
but we have sure experience for our guide
an ancient author equal with the best
relates this tale of dreams among the rest


two friends or brothers with devout intent
on some far pilgrimage together went
it happend so that when the sun was down
they just arrived by twilight at a town
that day had been the baiting of a bull
twas at a feast and every inn so full
that no void room in chamber or on ground
and but one sorry bed was to be found
and that so little it would hold but one
though till this hour they never lay alone
so were they forced to part one staid behind
his fellow sought what lodging he could find
at last he found a stall where oxen stood
and that he rather chose than lie abroad
twas in a farther yard without a door
but for his ease well litterd was the floor
his fellow who the narrow bed had kept
was weary and without a rocker slept


supine he snored but in the dead of night
he dreamd his friend appeard before his sight
who with a ghastly look and doleful cry
said help me brother or this night i die
arise and help before all help be vain
or in an oxs stall i shall be slain
roused from his rest he wakend in a start
shivering with horror and with aching heart


at length to cure himself by reason tries
tis but a dream and what are dreams but lies
so thinking changed his side and closed his eyes


his dream returns his friend appears again
the murderers come now help or i am slain
twas but a vision still and visions are but vain


he dreamd the third but now his friend appeard
pale naked pierced with wounds with blood besmeard
thrice warnd awake said he relief is late
the deed is done but thou revenge my fate


tardy of aid unseal thy heavy eyes
awake and with the dawning day arise
take to the western gate thy ready way
for by that passage they my corpse convey
my corpse is in a tumbril laid among
the filth and ordure and enclosed with dung
that cart arrest and raise a common cry
for sacred hunger of my gold i die
then showd his grisly wound and last he drew
a piteous sigh and took a long adieu


the frighted friend arose by break of day
and found the stall where late his fellow lay
then of his impious host inquiring more
was answerd that his guest was gone before
muttering he went said he by morning light
and much complaind of his ill rest by night


this raised suspicion in the pilgrims mind
because all hosts are of an evil kind
and oft to share the spoils with robbers joind


his dream confirmd his thought with troubled look
straight to the western gate his way he took
there as his dream foretold a cart he found
that carried compost forth to dung the ground
this when the pilgrim saw he stretchd his throat
and cried out murder with a yelling note
my murderd fellow in this cart lies dead
vengeance and justice on the villains head
you magistrates who sacred laws dispense
on you i call to punish this offence


the word thus given within a little space
the mob came roaring out and throngd the place


all in a trice they cast the cart to ground
and in the dung the murderd body found
though breathless warm and reeking from the wound


good heaven whose darling attribute we find
is boundless grace and mercy to mankind
abhors the cruel and the deeds of night
by wondrous ways reveals in open light
murder may pass unpunishd for a time
but tardy justice will oertake the crime


and oft a speedier pain the guilty feels
the hue and cry of heaven pursues him at the heels


fresh from the fact as in the present case
the criminals are seized upon the place
carter and host confronted face to face


stiff in denial as the law appoints
on engines they distend their tortured joints
so was confession forced the offence was known
and public justice on the offenders done


here may you see that visions are to dread
and in the page that follows this i read
of two young merchants whom the hope of gain
induced in partnership to cross the main
waiting till willing winds their sails supplied
within a trading town they long abide
full fairly situate on a havens side


one evening it befell that looking out
the wind they long had wishd was come about
well pleased they went to rest and if the gale
till morn continued both resolved to sail
but as together in a bed they lay
the younger had a dream at break of day
a man he thought stood frowning at his side
who warnd him for his safety to provide
nor put to sea but safe on shore abide
i come thy genius to command thy stay
trust not the winds for fatal is the day
and death unhoped attends the watery way
the vision said and vanishd from his sight
the dreamer wakend in a mortal fright


then pulld his drowsy neighbour and declared
what in his slumber he had seen and heard
his friend smiled scornful and with proud contempt
rejects as idle what his fellow dreamt
stay who will stay for me no fears restrain
who follow mercury the god of gain
let each man do as to his fancy seems
i wait not i till you have better dreams


dreams are but interludes which fancy makes
when monarch reason sleeps this mimic wakes
compounds a medley of disjointed things
a mob of cobblers and a court of kings
light fumes are merry grosser fumes are sad
both are the reasonable soul run mad
and many monstrous forms in sleep we see
that neither were nor are nor eer can be
sometimes forgotten things long cast behind
rush forward in the brain and come to mind
the nurses legends are for truths received
and the man dreams but what the boy believed


sometimes we but rehearse a former play
the night restores our actions done by day
as hounds in sleep will open for their prey
in short the farce of dreams is of a piece
chimeras all and more absurd or less
you who believe in tales abide alone
whateer i get this voyage is my own


thus while he spoke he heard the shouting crew
that calld aboard and took his last adieu
the vessel went before a merry gale
and for quick passage put on every sail
but when least feard and even in open day
the mischief overtook her in the way
whether she sprung a leak i cannot find
or whether she was overset with wind
or that some rock below her bottom rent
but down at once with all her crew she went
her fellow ships from far her loss descried
but only she was sunk and all were safe beside


by this example you are taught again
that dreams and visions are not always vain
but if dear partlet you are still in doubt
another tale shall make the former out


kenelm the son of kenulph mercias king
whose holy life the legends loudly sing
warnd in a dream his murder did foretell
from point to point as after it befell
all circumstances to his nurse he told
a wonder from a child of seven years old


the dream with horror heard the good old wife
from treason counselld him to guard his life
but close to keep the secret in his mind
for a boys vision small belief would find
the pious child by promise bound obeyd
nor was the fatal murder long delayd
by quenda slain he fell before his time
made a young martyr by his sisters crime
the tale is told by venerable bede
which at your better leisure you may read


macrobius too relates the vision sent
to the great scipio with the famed event
objections makes but after makes replies
and adds that dreams are often prophecies


of daniel you may read in holy writ
who when the king his vision did forget
could word for word the wondrous dream repeat
nor less of patriarch joseph understand
who by a dream enslaved the egyptian land
the years of plenty and of dearth foretold
when for their bread their liberty they sold
nor must the exalted butler be forgot
nor he whose dream presaged his hanging lot


and did not croesus the same death foresee
raised in his vision on a lofty tree
the wife of hector in his utmost pride
dreamd of his death the night before he died
well was he warnd from battle to refrain
but men to death decreed are warnd in vain
he dared the dream and by his fatal foe was slain


much more i know which i forbear to speak
for see the ruddy day begins to break
let this suffice that plainly i foresee
my dream was bad and bodes adversity
but neither pills nor laxatives i like
they only serve to make the wellman sick
of these his gain the sharp physician makes
and often gives a purge but seldom takes
they not correct but poison all the blood
and neer did any but the doctors good
their tribe trade trinkets i defy them all
with every work of pothecarys hall
these melancholy matters i forbear
but let me tell thee partlet mine and swear
that when i view the beauties of thy face
i fear not death nor dangers nor disgrace


so may my soul have bliss as when i spy
the scarlet red about thy partridge eye
while thou art constant to thy own true knight
while thou art mine and i am thy delight
all sorrows at thy presence take their flight


for true it is as _in principio
mulier est hominis confusio_
madam the meaning of this latin is
that woman is to man his sovereign bliss
for when by night i feel your tender side
though for the narrow perch i cannot ride


yet i have such a solace in my mind
that all my boding cares are cast behind
and even already i forget my dream
he said and downward flew from off the beam
for daylight now began apace to spring
the thrush to whistle and the lark to sing
then crowing clappd his wings the appointed call
to chuck his wives together in the hall


by this the widow had unbarrd the door
and chanticleer went strutting out before
with royal courage and with heart so light
as showd he scorned the visions of the night
now roaming in the yard he spurnd the ground
and gave to partlet the first grain he found


then often featherd her with wanton play
and trod her twenty times ere prime of day
and took by turns and gave so much delight
her sisters pined with envy at the sight
he chuckd again when other corns he found
and scarcely deignd to set a foot to ground
but swaggerd like a lord about his hall
and his seven wives came running at his call


twas now the month in which the world began
if march beheld the first created man
and since the vernal equinox the sun
in aries twelve degrees or more had run
when casting up his eyes against the light
both month and day and hour he measured right
and told more truly than the ephemeris
for art may err but nature cannot miss
thus numbering times and seasons in his breast
his second crowing the third hour confessd
then turning said to partlet see my dear
how lavish nature has adornd the year


how the pale primrose and blue violet spring
and birds essay their throats disused to sing
all these are ours and i with pleasure see
man strutting on two legs and aping me
an unfledged creature of a lumpish frame
endowd with fewer particles of flame
our dame sits cowering oer a kitchen fire
i draw fresh air and natures works admire
and even this day in more delight abound
than since i was an egg i ever found


the time shall come when chanticleer shall wish
his words unsaid and hate his boasted bliss
the crested bird shall by experience know
jove made not him his masterpiece below
and learn the latter end of joy is woe
the vessel of his bliss to dregs is run
and heaven will have him taste his other tun


ye wise draw near and hearken to my tale
which proves that oft the proud by flattery fall
the legend is as true i undertake
as tristran is and launcelot of the lake
which all our ladies in such reverence hold
as if in book of martyrs it were told


a fox fullfraught with seeming sanctity
that feard an oath but like the devil would lie
who lookd like lent and had the holy leer
and durst not sin before he said his prayer
this pious cheat that never suckd the blood
nor chewd the flesh of lambs but when he could
had passd three summers in the neighbouring wood
and musing long whom next to circumvent
on chanticleer his wicked fancy bent
and in his high imagination cast
by stratagem to gratify his taste


the plot contrived before the break of day
saint reynard through the hedge had made his way
the pale was next but proudly with a bound
he leapt the fence of the forbidden ground
yet fearing to be seen within a bed
of coleworts he conceald his wily head
then skulkd till afternoon and watchd his time
as murderers use to perpetrate his crime


oh hypocrite ingenious to destroy
oh traitor worse than sinon was to troy
oh vile subverter of the gallic reign
more false than gano was to charlemagne
oh chanticleer in an unhappy hour
didst thou forsake the safety of thy bower
better for thee thou hadst believed thy dream
and not that day descended from the beam
but here the doctors eagerly dispute
some hold predestination absolute
some clerks maintain that heaven at first foresees
and in the virtue of foresight decrees


if this be so then prescience binds the will
and mortals are not free to good or ill
for what he first foresaw he must ordain
or its eternal prescience may be vain
as bad for us as prescience had not been
for first or last hes author of the sin
and who says that let the blaspheming man
say worse even of the devil if he can
for how can that eternal power be just
to punish man who sins because he must
or how can he reward a virtuous deed
which is not done by us but first decreed


i cannot bolt this matter to the bran
as bradwardin and holy austin can
if prescience can determine actions so
that we must do because he did foreknow
or that foreknowing yet our choice is free
not forced to sin by strict necessity
this strict necessity they simple call
another sort there is conditional


the first so binds the will that things foreknown
by spontaneity not choice are done
thus galleyslaves tug willing at their oar
content to work in prospect of the shore
but would not work at all if not constraind before
that other does not liberty constrain
but man may either act or may refrain
heaven made us agents free to good or ill
and forced it not though he foresaw the will
freedom was first bestowd on human race
and prescience only held the second place


if he could make such agents wholly free
i not dispute the points too high for me
for heavens unfathomd power what man can sound
or put to his omnipotence a bound
he made us to his image all agree
that image is the soul and that must be
or not the makers image or be free
but whether it were better man had been
by nature bound to good not free to sin
i waive for fear of splitting on a rock
the tale i tell is only of a cock
who had not run the hazard of his life
had he believed his dream and not his wife


for women with a mischief to their kind
pervert with bad advice our better mind
a womans counsel brought us first to woe
and made her man his paradise forego
where at hearts ease he lived and might have been
as free from sorrow as he was from sin
for what the devil had their sex to do
that born to folly they presumed to know
and could not see the serpent in the grass
but i myself presume and let it pass


silence in times of suffering is the best
tis dangerous to disturb an hornets nest
in other authors you may find enough
but all they say of dames is idle stuff
legends of lying wits together bound
the wife of bath would throw them to the ground
these are the words of chanticleer not mine
i honour dames and think their sex divine


now to continue what my tale begun
lay madam partlet basking in the sun
breasthigh in sand her sisters in a row
enjoyd the beams above the warmth below
the cock that of his flesh was ever free
sung merrier than the mermaid in the sea
and so befell that as he cast his eye


among the coleworts on a butterfly
he saw false reynard where he lay full low
i need not swear he had no list to crow
but cried _cock cock_ and gave a sudden start
as sore dismayd and frighted at his heart
for birds and beasts informd by nature know
kinds opposite to theirs and fly their foe
so chanticleer who never saw a fox
yet shunnd him as a sailor shuns the rocks
but the false loon who could not work his will
but open force employd his flattering skill


i hope my lord said he i not offend
are you afraid of me that am your friend
i were a beast indeed to do you wrong
i who have loved and honourd you so long
stay gentle sir nor take a false alarm
for on my soul i never meant you harm
i come no spy nor as a traitor press
to learn the secrets of your soft recess
far be from reynard so profane a thought
but by the sweetness of your voice was brought


for as i bid my beads by chance i heard
the song as of an angel in the yard
a song that would have charmd the infernal gods
and banishd horror from the dark abodes
had orpheus sung it in the nether sphere
so much the hymn had pleased the tyrants ear
the wife had been detaind to keep the husband there


my lord your sire familiarly i knew
a peer deserving such a son as you
he with your ladymother whom heaven rest
has often graced my house and been my guest
to view his living features does me good
for i am your poor neighbour in the wood


and in my cottage should be proud to see
the worthy heir of my friends family
but since i speak of singing let me say
as with an upright heart i safely may
that save yourself there breathes not on the ground
one like your father for a silver sound
so sweetly would he wake the winter day
that matrons to the church mistook their way
and thought they heard the merry organ play


and he to raise his voice with artful care
what will not beaux attempt to please the fair
on tiptoe stood to sing with greater strength
and stretchd his comely neck at all the length
and while he straind his voice to pierce the skies
as saints in raptures use would shut his eyes


that the sound striving through the narrow throat
his winking might avail to mend the note
by this in song he never had his peer
from sweet cecilia down to chanticleer
nor maros muse who sung the mighty man
nor pindars heavenly lyre nor horace when a swan
your ancestors proceed from race divine
from brennus and belinus is your line
who gave to sovereign rome such loud alarms
that even the priests were not excused from arms


besides a famous monk of modern times
has left of cocks recorded in his rhymes
that of a parish priest the son and heir
when sons of priests were from the proverb clear
affronted once a cock of noble kind
and either lamed his legs or struck him blind
for which the clerk his father was disgraced
and in his benefice another placed
now sing my lord if not for love of me
yet for the sake of sweet saint charity
make hills and dales and earth and heaven rejoice
and emulate your fathers angelvoice


the cock was pleased to hear him speak so fair
and proud beside as solar people are
nor could the treason from the truth descry
so was he ravishd with this flattery
so much the more as from a little elf
he had a high opinion of himself
though sickly slender and not large of limb
concluding all the world was made for him


ye princes raised by poets to the gods
and alexanderdg b up in lying odes
believe not every flattering knaves report
theres many a reynard lurking in the court
and he shall be received with more regard
and listend to than modest truth is heard


this chanticleer of whom the story sings
stood high upon his toes and clappd his wings
then stretchd his neck and wink d with both his eyes
ambitious as he sought the olympic prize
but while he paind himself to raise his note
false renyard rushd and caught him by the throat
then on his back he laid the precious load
and sought his wonted shelter of the wood
swiftly he made his way the mischief done
of all unheeded and pursued by none


alas what stay is there in human state
or who can shun inevitable fate
the doom was written the decree was passd
ere the foundations of the world were cast
in aries though the sun exalted stood
his patronplanet to procure his good
yet saturn was his mortal foe and he
in libra raised opposed the same degree
the rays both good and bad of equal power
each thwarting other made a mingled hour


on friday morn he dreamt this direful dream
cross to the worthy native in his scheme
ah blissful venus goddess of delight
how couldst thou suffer thy devoted knight
on thy own day to fall by foe oppressd
the wight of all the world who served thee best


who true to love was all for recreation
and minded not the work of propagation
ganfrideg c who couldst so well in rhyme complain
the death of richard with an arrow slain
why had not i thy muse or thou my heart
to sing this heavy dirge with equal art
that i like thee on friday might complain
for on that day was coeur de lion slain


not louder cries when ilium was in flames
were sent to heaven by woful trojan dames
when pyrrhus tossd on high his burnishd blade
and offerd priam to his fathers shade
than for the cock the widowd poultry made
fair partlet first when he was borne from sight
with sovereign shrieks bewaild her captive knight
far louder than the carthaginian wife
when asdrubal her husband lost his life
when she beheld the smouldering flames ascend
and all the punic glories at an end


willing into the fires she plunged her head
with greater ease than others seek their bed
not more aghast the matrons of renown
when tyrant nero burnd the imperial town
shriekd for the downfall in a doleful cry
for which their guiltless lords were doomd to die


now to my story i return again
the trembling widow and her daughters twain
this woful cackling cry with horror heard
of those distracted damsels in the yard
and starting up beheld the heavy sight
how reynard to the forest took his flight
and cross his back as in triumphant scorn
the hope and pillar of the house was borne


the fox the wicked fox was all the cry
out from his house ran every neighbour nigh
the vicar first and after him the crew
with forks and staves the felon to pursue
ran coll our dog and talbot with the band
and malkin with her distaff in her hand
ran cow and calf and family of hogs
in panic horror of pursuing dogs
with many a deadly grunt and doleful squeak
poor swine as if their pretty hearts would break


the shouts of men the women in dismay
with shrieks augment the terror of the day
the ducks that heard the proclamation cried
and feard a persecution might betide
full twenty miles from town their voyage take
obscure in rushes of the liquid lake
the geese fly oer the barn the bees in arms
drive headlong from their waxen cells in swarms
jack straw at londonstone with all his rout
struck not the city with so loud a shout


not when with english hate they did pursue
a frenchman or an unbelieving jew
not when the welkin rung with one and all
and echoes bounded back from foxs hall
earth seemd to sink beneath and heaven above to fall
with might and main they chased the murderous fox
with brazen trumpets and inflated box
to kindle mars with military sounds
nor wanted horns to inspire sagacious hounds


but see how fortune can confound the wise
and when they least expect it turn the dice
the captivecock who scarce could draw his breath
and lay within the very jaws of death
yet in this agony his fancy wrought
and fear supplied him with this happy thought


yours is the prize victorious prince said he
the vicar my defeat and all the village see
enjoy your friendly fortune while you may
and bid the churls that envy you the prey
call back their mongrel curs and cease their cry
see fools the shelter of the wood is nigh
and chanticleer in your despite shall die
he shall be pluckd and eaten to the bone
tis well advised in faith it shall be done


this reynard said but as the word he spoke
the prisoner with a spring from prison broke
then stretchd his featherd fans with all his might
and to the neighbouring maple wingd his flight
whom when the traitor safe on tree beheld
he cursed the gods with shame and sorrow filld
shame for his folly sorrow out of time
for plotting an unprofitable crime
yet mastering both the artificer of lies
renews the assault and his last battery tries


though i said he did neer in thought offend
how justly may my lord suspect his friend
the appearance is against me i confess
who seemingly have put you in distress
you if your goodness does not plead my cause
may think i broke all hospitable laws
to bear you from your palaceyard by might
and put your noble person in a fright


this since you take it ill i must repent
though heaven can witness with no bad intent
i practised it to make you taste your cheer
with double pleasure first prepared by fear
so loyal subjects often seize their prince
forced for his good to seeming violence
yet mean his sacred person not the least offence
descend so help me jove as you shall find
that reynard comes of no dissembling kind


nay quoth the cock but i beshrew us both
if i believe a saint upon his oath
an honest man may take a knaves advice
but idiots only may be cozend twice
once warnd is well bewared no nattering lies
shall soothe me more to sing with winking eyes
and open mouth for fear of catching flies
who blindfold walks upon a rivers brim
when he should see has he deserved to swim


better sir cock let all contention cease
come down said reynard let us treat of peace
a peace with all my soul said chanticleer
but with your favour i will treat it here
and lest the truce with treason should be mixd
tis my concern to have the tree betwixt


in this plain fable you the effect may see
of negligence and fond credulity
and learn besides of flatterers to beware
then most pernicious when they speak too fair
the cock and fox the fool and knave imply
the truth is moral though the tale a lie
who spoke in parables i dare not say
but sure he knew it was a pleasing way
sound sense by plain example to convey
and in a heathen author we may find
that pleasure with instruction should be joind
so take the corn and leave the chaff behind


now turning from the wintry signs the sun
his course exalted through the ram had run
and whirling up the skies his chariot drove
through taurus and the lightsome realms of love
where venus from her orb descends in showers
to glad the ground and paint the fields with flowers
when first the tender blades of grass appear
and buds that yet the blast of eurus fear
stand at the door of life and doubt to clothe the year


till gentle heat and soft repeated rains
make the green blood to dance within their veins
then at their call emboldend out they come
and swell the gems and burst the narrow room
broader and broader yet their blooms display
salute the welcome sun and entertain the day
then from their breathing souls the sweets repair
to scent the skies and purge the unwholesome air
joy spreads the heart and with a general song
spring issues out and leads the jolly months along


in that sweet season as in bed i lay
and sought in sleep to pass the night away
i turnd my weary side but still in vain
though full of youthful health and void of pain
cares i had none to keep me from my rest
for love had never enterd in my breast
i wanted nothing fortune could supply
nor did she slumber till that hour deny
i wonderd then but after found it true
much joy had dried away the balmy dew
seas would be pools without the brushing air
to curl the waves and sure some little care
should weary nature so to make her want repair


when chanticleer the second watch had sung
scorning the scorner sleep from bed i sprung
and dressing by the moon in loose array
passd out in open air preventing day
and sought a goodly grove as fancy led my way
straight as a line in beauteous order stood
of oaks unshorn a venerable wood
fresh was the grass beneath and every tree
at distance planted in a due degree
their branching arms in air with equal space
stretchd to their neighbours with a long embrace
and the new leaves on every bough were seen
some ruddy colourd some of lighter green


the painted birds companions of the spring
hopping from spray to spray were heard to sing
both eyes and ears received a like delight
enchanting music and a charming sight
on philomel i fixd my whole desire
and listend for the queen of all the quire
fain would i hear her heavenly voice to sing
and wanted yet an omen to the spring


attending long in vain i took the way
which through a path but scarcely printed lay
in narrow mazes oft it seemd to meet
and lookd as lightly pressd by fairy feet
wandering i walkd alone for still methought
to some strange end so strange a path was wrought
at last it led me where an arbour stood
the sacred receptacle of the wood


this place unmarkd though oft i walkd the green
in all my progress i had never seen
and seized at once with wonder and delight
gazed all around me new to the transporting sight
twas benchd with turf and goodly to be seen
the thick young grass arose in fresher green
the mound was newly made no sight could pass
betwixt the nice partitions of the grass
the wellunited sods so closely lay
and all around the shades defended it from day


for sycamores with eglantine were spread
a hedge about the sides a covering overhead
and so the fragrant brier was wove between
the sycamore and flowers were mixed with green
that nature seemd to vary the delight
and satisfied at once the smell and sight
the master workman of the bower was known
through fairylands and built for oberon
who twining leaves with such proportion drew
they rose by measure and by rule they grew
no mortal tongue can half the beauty tell
for none but hands divine could work so well
both roof and sides were like a parlour made
a soft recess and a cool summer shade


the hedge was set so thick no foreign eye
the persons placed within it could espy
but all that passd without with ease was seen
as if nor fence nor tree was placed between
twas borderd with a field and some was plain
with grass and some was sowd with rising grain
that now the dew with spangles deckd the ground
a sweeter spot of earth was never found


i lookd and lookd and still with new delight
such joy my soul such pleasures filld my sight
and the fresh eglantine exhaled a breath
whose odours were of power to raise from death
nor sullen discontent nor anxious care
even though brought thither could inhabit there
but thence they fled as from their mortal foe
for this sweet place could only pleasure know


thus as i mused i cast aside my eye
and saw a medlartree was planted nigh
the spreading branches made a goodly show
and full of opening blooms was every bough
a goldfinch there i saw with gaudy pride
of painted plumes that hoppd from side to side
still pecking as she passd and still she drew
the sweets from every flower and suckd the dew
sufficed at length she warbled in her throat
and tuned her voice to many a merry note
but indistinct and neither sweet nor clear
yet such as soothed my soul and pleased my ear


her short performance was no sooner tried
when she i sought the nightingale replied
so sweet so shrill so variously she sung
that the grove echoed and the valleys rung
and i so ravishd with her heavenly note
i stood entranced and had no room for thought
but all oerpowerd with ecstasy of bliss
was in a pleasing dream of paradise
at length i waked and looking round the bower
searchd every tree and pryd on every flower
if any where by chance i might espy
the rural poet of the melody
for still methought she sung not far away
at last i found her on a laurel spray
close by my side she sat and fair in sight
full in a line against her opposite
where stood with eglantine the laurel twined
and both their native sweets were well conjoind


on the green bank i sat and listend long
sitting was more convenient for the song
nor till her lay was ended could i move
but wishd to dwell for ever in the grove
only methought the time too swiftly passd
and every note i feard would be the last
my sight and smell and hearing were employd
and all three senses in full gust enjoyd
and what alone did all the rest surpass
the sweet possession of the fairy place
single and conscious to myself alone
of pleasures to the excluded world unknown
pleasures which nowhere else were to be found
and all elysium in a spot of ground


thus while i sat intent to see and hear
and drew perfumes of more than vital air
all suddenly i heard the approaching sound
of vocal music on the enchanted ground
a host of saints it seemd so full the quire
as if the blessd above did all conspire
to join their voices and neglect the lyre
at length there issued from the grove behind
a fair assembly of the female kind
a train less fair as ancient fathers tell
seduced the sons of heaven to rebel


i pass their form and every charming grace
less than an angel would their worth debase
but their attire like liveries of a kind
all rich and rare is fresh within my mind
in velvet white as snow the troop was gownd
the seams with sparkling emeralds set around
their hoods and sleeves the same and purfled oer
with diamonds pearls and all the shining store
of eastern pomp their long descending train
with rubies edged and sapphires swept the plain


high on their heads with jewels richly set
each lady wore a radiant coronet
beneath the circles all the quire was graced
with chaplets green on their fair foreheads placed
of laurel some of woodbine many more
and wreaths of agnus castusg e others bore
these last who with those virgin crowns were dressd
appeard in higher honour than the rest
they danced around but in the midst was seen
a lady of a more majestic mien
by stature and by beauty markd their sovereign queen


she in the midst began with sober grace
her servants eyes were fixd upon her face
and as she moved or turnd her motions viewd
her measures kept and step by step pursued
methought she trod the ground with greater grace
with more of godhead shining in her face
and as in beauty she surpassd the quire
so nobler than the rest was her attire
a crown of ruddy gold enclosed her brow
plain without pomp and rich without a show
a branch of agnus castus in her hand
she bore aloft her sceptre of command
admired adored by all the circling crowd
for wheresoeer she turnd her face they bowd


and as she danced a roundelay she sung
in honour of the laurel ever young
she raised her voice on high and sung so clear
the fawns came scudding from the groves to hear
and all the bending forest lent an ear
at every close she made the attending throng
replied and bore the burden of the song
so just so small yet in so sweet a note
it seemd the music melted in the throat


thus dancing on and singing as they danced
they to the middle of the mead advanced
till round my arbour a new ring they made
and footed it about the sacred shade
oerjoyd to see the jolly troops so near
but somewhat awed i shook with holy fear
yet not so much but what i noted well
who did the most in song or dance excel


not long i had observed when from afar
i heard a sudden symphony of war
the neighing coursers and the soldiers cry
and sounding trumps that seemd to tear the sky
i saw soon after this behind the grove
from whence the ladies did in order move
come issuing out in arms a warrior train
that like a deluge pourd upon the plain


on barbed steeds they rode in proud array
thick as the college of the bees in may
when swarming oer the dusky fields they fly
new to the flowers and intercept the sky
so fierce they drove their coursers were so fleet
that the turf trembled underneath their feet


to tell their costly furniture were long
the summers day would end before the song
to purchase but the tenth of all their store
would make the mighty persian monarch poor
yet what i can i will before the rest
the trumpets issued in white mantles dressd
a numerous troop and all their heads around
with chaplets green of cerrialoakg f were crownd
and at each trumpet was a banner bound
which waving in the wind displayed at large
their masters coat of arms and knightly charge
broad were the banners and of snowy hue
a purer web the silkworm never drew


the chief about their necks the scutcheons wore
with orient pearls and jewels powderd oer
broad were their collars too and every one
was set about with many a costly stone
next these of kingsatarms a goodly train
in proud array came prancing oer the plain
their cloaks were cloth of silver mixd with gold
and garlands green around their temples rolld


rich crowns were on their royal scutcheons placed
with sapphires diamonds and with rubies graced
and as the trumpets their appearance made
so these in habits were alike arrayd
but with a pace more sober and more slow
and twenty rank in rank they rode arow
the pursuivants came next in number more
and like the heralds each his scutcheon bore
clad in white velvet all their troop they led
with each an oaken chaplet on his head


nine royal knights in equal rank succeed
each warrior mounted on a fiery steed
in golden armour glorious to behold
the rivets of their arms were naild with gold
their surcoats of white ermine fur were made
with cloth of gold between that cast a glittering shade
the trappings of their steeds were of the same
the golden fringe even set the ground on flame
and drew a precious trail a crown divine
of laurel did about their temples twine


three henchmen were for every knight assignd
all in rich livery clad and of a kind
white velvet but unshorn for cloaks they wore
and each within his hand a truncheon bore
the foremost held a helm of rare device
a princes ransom would not pay the price
the second bore the buckler of his knight
the third of cornelwood a spear upright
headed with piercing steel and polishd bright
like to their lords their equipage was seen
and all their foreheads crownd with garlands green


and after these came armd with spear and shield
a host so great as coverd all the field
and all their foreheads like the knights before
with laurels evergreen were shaded oer
or oak or other leaves of lasting kind
tenacious of the stem and firm against the wind
some in their hands beside the lance and shield
the boughs of woodbine or of hawthorn held
or branches for their mystic emblems took
of palm of laurel and of cerrialoak


thus marching to the trumpets lofty sound
drawn in two lines adverse they wheeld around
and in the middle meadow took their ground


among themselves the tourney they divide
in equal squadrons ranged on either side
then turnd their horses heads and man to man
and steed to steed opposed the jousts began
they lightly set their lances in the rest
and at the sign against each other pressd
they met i sitting at my ease beheld
the mixd events and fortunes of the field


some broke their spears some tumbled horse and man
and round the field the lightend coursers ran
an hour and more like tides in equal sway
they rushd and won by turns and lost the day


at length the nine who still together held
their fainting foes to shameful flight compelld
and with resistless force oerran the field


thus to their fame when finishd was the fight
the victors from their lofty steeds alight
like them dismounted all the warlike train
and two by two proceeded oer the plain
till to the fair assembly they advanced
who near the secret arbour sung and danced


the ladies left their measures at the sight
to meet the chiefs returning from the fight
and each with open arms embraced her chosen knight


amid the plain a spreading laurel stood
the grace and ornament of all the wood
that pleasing shade they sought a soft retreat
from sudden april showers a shelter from the heat
her leafy arms with such extent were spread
so near the clouds was her aspiring head
that hosts of birds that wing the liquid air
perchd in the boughs had nightly lodging there
and flocks of sheep beneath the shade from far
might hear the rattling hail and wintry war


from heavens inclemency here found retreat
enjoyd the cool and shunnd the scorching heat
a hundred knights might there at ease abide
and every knight a lady by his side
the trunk itself such odours did bequeath
that a moluccang g breeze to these was common breath


the lords and ladies here approaching paid
their homage with a low obeisance made
and seemd to venerate the sacred shade


these rites performd their pleasures they pursue
with song of love and mix with measures new
around the holy tree their dance they frame
and every champion leads his chosen dame


i cast my sight upon the farther field
and a fresh object of delight beheld
for from the region of the west i heard
new music sound and a new troop appeard
of knights and ladies mixd a jolly band
but all on foot they marchd and hand in hand


the ladies dressd in rich symars were seen
of florence satin flowerd with white and green
and for a shade betwixt the bloomy gridelin


the borders of their petticoats below
were guarded thick with rubies on a row
and every damsel wore upon her head
of flowers a garland blended white and red
attired in mantles all the knights were seen
that gratified the view with cheerful green


their chaplets of their ladies colours were
composed of white and red to shade their shining hair
before the merry troop the minstrels playd
all in their masters liveries were arrayd
and clad in green and on their temples wore
the chaplets white and red their ladies bore
their instruments were various in their kind
some for the bow and some for breathing wind
the sawtry pipe and hautboys noisy band
and the soft lute trembling beneath the touching hand


a tuft of daisies on a flowery lea
they saw and thitherward they bent their way
to this both knights and dames their homage made
and due obeisance to the daisy paid
and then the band of flutes began to play
to which a lady sung a virelayg h
and still at every close she would repeat
the burden of the song _the daisy is so sweet
the daisy is so sweet_ when she begun
the troop of knights and dames continued on
the concert and the voice so charmd my ear
and soothed my soul that it was heaven to hear


but soon their pleasure passd at noon of day
the sun with sultry beams began to play
not sirius shoots a fiercer flame from high
when with his poisonous breath he blasts the sky


then droopd the fading flowers their beauty fled
and closed their sickly eyes and hung the head
and rivelld up with heat lay dying in their bed


the ladies gaspd and scarcely could respire
the breath they drew no longer air but fire
the fainty knights were scorchd and knew not where
to run for shelter for no shade was near
and after this the gathering clouds amain
pourd down a storm of rattling hail and rain
and lightning flashd betwixt the field and flowers
burnt up before were buried in the showers


the ladies and the knights no shelter nigh
bare to the weather and the wintry sky
were drooping wet disconsolate and wan
and through their thin array received the rain
while those in white protected by the tree
saw pass in vain the assault and stood from danger free
but as compassion moved their gentle minds
when ceased the storm and silent were the winds


displeased at what not suffering they had seen
they went to cheer the faction of the green
the queen in white array before her band
saluting took her rival by the hand
so did the knights and dames with courtly grace
and with behaviour sweet their foes embrace
then thus the queen with laurel on her brow
fair sister i have sufferd in your woe


nor shall be wanting aught within my power
for your relief in my refreshing bower
that other answerd with a lowly look
and soon the gracious invitation took
for ill at ease both she and all her train
the scorching sun had borne and beating rain
like courtesy was used by all in white
each dame a dame received and every knight a knight


the laurel champions with their swords invade
the neighbouring forests where the jousts were made
and serewood from the rotten hedges took
and seeds of latent fire from flints provoke
a cheerful blaze arose and by the fire
they warmd their frozen feet and dried their wet attire
refreshd with heat the ladies sought around
for virtuous herbs which gatherd from the ground
they squeezed the juice and cooling ointment made
which on their sunburnt cheeks and their chapt skins they laid
then sought green salads which they bade them eat
a sovereign remedy for inward heat


the lady of the leaf ordaind a feast
and made the lady of the flower her guest
when lo a bower ascended on the plain
with sudden seats ordaind and large for either train
this bower was near my pleasant arbour placed
that i could hear and see whatever passd
the ladies sat with each a knight between
distinguishd by their colours white and green


the vanquishd party with the victors joind
nor wanted sweet discourse the banquet of the mind
meantime the minstrels playd on either side
vain of their art and for the mastery vied
the sweet contention lasted for an hour
and reachd my secret arbour from the bower


the sun was set and vesper to supply
his absent beams had lighted up the sky
when philomel officious all the day
to sing the service of the ensuing may
fled from her laurel shade and wingd her flight
directly to the queen arrayd in white
and hopping sat familiar on her hand
a new musician and increased the band


the goldfinch who to shun the scalding heat
had changed the medlar for a safer seat
and hid in bushes scaped the bitter shower
now perchd upon the lady of the flower
and either songster holding out their throats
and folding up their wings renewd their notes
as if all day precluding to the fight
they only had rehearsed to sing by night
the banquet ended and the battle done
they danced by starlight and the friendly moon
and when they were to part the laureate queen
supplied with steeds the lady of the green
her and her train conducting on the way
the moon to follow and avoid the day


this when i saw inquisitive to know
the secret moral of the mystic show
i started from my shade in hopes to find
some nymph to satisfy my longing mind
and as my fair adventure fell i found
a lady all in white with laurel crownd
who closed the rear and softly paced along
repeating to herself the former song
with due respect my body i inclined
as to some being of superior kind
and made my court according to the day
wishing her queen and her a happy may
great thanks my daughter with a gracious bow
she said and i who much desired to know
of whence she was yet fearful how to break
my mind adventured humbly thus to speak


madam might i presume and not offend
so may the stars and shining moon attend


your nightly sports as you vouchsafe to tell
what nymphs they were who mortal forms excel
and what the knights who fought in listed fields so well


to this the dame replied fair daughter know
that what you saw was all a fairy show
and all those airy shapes you now behold
were human bodies once and clothed with earthly mould
our souls not yet prepared for upper light
till doomsday wander in the shades of night


this only holiday of all the year
we privileged in sunshine may appear
with songs and dance we celebrate the day
and with due honours usher in the may
at other times we reign by night alone
and posting through the skies pursue the moon
but when the morn arises none are found
for cruel demogorgon walks the round
and if he finds a fairy lag in light
he drives the wretch before and lashes into night


all courteous are by kind and ever proud
with friendly offices to help the good
in every land we have a larger space
than what is known to you of mortal race
where we with green adorn our fairy bowers
and even this grove unseen before is ours
know farther every lady clothed in white
and crownd with oak and laurel every knight
are servants to the leaf by liveries known
of innocence and i myself am one
saw you not her so graceful to behold
in white attire and crownd with radiant gold
the sovereign lady of our land is she
diana calld the queen of chastity
and for the spotless name of maid she bears
that agnus castus in her hand appears


and all her train with leafy chaplets crownd
were for unblamed virginity renownd
but those the chief and highest in command
who bear those holy branches in their hand


the knights adornd with laurel crowns are they
whom death nor danger ever could dismay
victorious names who made the world obey


who while they lived in deeds of arms excelld
and after death for deities were held
but those who wear the woodbine on their brow
were knights of love who never broke their vow
firm to their plighted faith and ever free
from fears and fickle chance and jealousy
the lords and ladies who the woodbine bear
as true as tristram and isotta were


but what are those said i the unconquerd nine
who crownd with laurelwreaths in golden armour shine
and who the knights in green and what the train
of ladies dressd with daisies on the plain
why both the bands in worship disagree
and some adore the flower and some the tree


just is your suit fair daughter said the dame
those laurelld chiefs were men of mighty fame
nine worthies were they calld of different rites
three jews three pagans and three christian knights


these as you see ride foremost in the field
as they the foremost rank of honour held
and all in deeds of chivalry excelld


their temples wreathed with leaves that still renew
for deathless laurel is the victors due
who bear the bows were knights in arthurs reign
twelve they and twelve the peers of charlemagne
for bows the strength of brawny arms imply
emblems of valour and of victory


behold an order yet of newer date
doubling their number equal in their state
our englands ornament the crowns defence
in battle brave protectors of their prince
unchanged by fortune to their sovereign true
for which their manly legs are bound with blue


these of the garter calld of faith unstaind
in fighting fields the laurel have obtaind
and well repaid the honours which they gaind


the laurel wreaths were first by cesar worn
and still they cesars successors adorn
one leaf of this is immortality
and more of worth than all the world can buy


one doubt remains said i the dames in green
what were their qualities and who their queen
flora commands said she those nymphs and knights
who lived in slothful ease and loose delights
who never acts of honour durst pursue
the men inglorious knights the ladies all untrue
who nursed in idleness and traind in courts
passd all their precious hours in plays and sports
till death behind came stalking on unseen
and witherd like the storm the freshness of their green
these and their mates enjoy their present hour
and therefore pay their homage to the flower


but knights in knightly deeds should persevere
and still continue what at first they were
continue and proceed in honours fair career


no room for cowardice or dull delay
from good to better they should urge their way
for this with golden spurs the chiefs are graced
with pointed rowels armd to mend their haste


for this with lasting leaves their brows are bound
for laurel is the sign of labour crownd
which bears the bitter blast nor shaken falls to ground


from winter winds it suffers no decay
for ever fresh and fair and every month is may


even when the vital sap retreats below
even when the hoary head is hid in snow
the life is in the leaf and still between
the fits of falling snow appears the streaky green
not so the flower which lasts for little space
a shortlived good and an uncertain grace
this way and that the feeble stem is driven
weak to sustain the storms and injuries of heaven


proppd by the spring it lifts aloft the head
but of a sickly beauty soon to shed
in summer living and in winter dead


for things of tender kind for pleasure made
shoot up with swift increase and sudden are decayd


with humble words the wisest i could frame
and profferd service i repaid the dame
that of her grace she gave her maid to know
the secret meaning of this moral show
and she to prove what profit i had made
of mystic truth in fables first conveyd
demanded till the next returning may
whether the leaf or flower i would obey
i chose the leaf she smiled with sober cheer
and wishd me fair adventure for the year
and gave me charms and sigils for defence
against ill tongues that scandal innocence
but i said she my fellows must pursue
already past the plain and out of view


we parted thus i homeward sped my way
bewilderd in the wood till dawn of day
and met the merry crew who danced about the may
then late refreshd with sleep i rose to write
the visionary vigils of the night


blush as thou mayst my little book with shame
nor hope with homely verse to purchase fame
for such thy maker chose and so designd
thy simple style to suit thy lowly kind


in days of old when arthur filld the throne
whose acts and fame to foreign lands were blown
the king of elves and little fairy queen
gambolld on heaths and danced on every green
and where the jolly troop had led the round
the grass unbidden rose and markd the ground


nor darkling did they dance the silver light
of phoebe served to guide their steps aright
and with their tripping pleased prolong the night


her beams they followd where at full she playd
nor longer than she shed her horns they stayd
from thence with airy flight to foreign lands conveyd


above the rest our britain held they dear
more solemnly they kept their sabbaths here
and made more spacious rings and revelld half the year


i speak of ancient times for now the swain
returning late may pass the woods in vain
and never hope to see the nightly train


in vain the dairy now with mints is dressd
the dairymaid expects no fairy guest
to skim the bowls and after pay the feast


she sighs and shakes her empty shoes in vain
no silver penny to reward her pain
for priests with prayers and other godly gear
have made the merry goblins disappear
and where they playd their merry pranks before
have sprinkled holy water on the floor


and friars that through the wealthy regions run
thick as the motes that twinkle in the sun
resort to farmers rich and bless their halls
and exorcise the beds and cross the walls
this makes the fairy quires forsake the place
when once tis hallowd with the rites of grace


but in the walks where wicked elves have been
the learning of the parish now is seen
the midnight parson posting oer the green


with gown tuckd up to wakes for sunday next
with humming ale encouraging his text
nor wants the holy leer to country girl betwixt


from fiends and imps he sets the village free
there haunts not any incubus but he
the maids and women need no danger fear
to walk by night and sanctity so near
for by some haycock or some shady thorn
he bids his beads both evensong and morn


it so befell in this king arthurs reign
a lusty knight was pricking oer the plain
a bachelor he was and of the courtly train


it happend as he rode a damsel gay
in russet robes to market took her way
soon on the girl he cast an amorous eye
so straight she walkd and on her pasterns high
if seeing her behind he liked her pace
now turning short he better likes her face
he lights in haste and full of youthful fire
by force accomplishd his obscene desire
this done away he rode not unespied
for swarming at his back the country cried
and once in view they never lost the sight
but seized and piniond brought to court the knight


then courts of kings were held in high renown
ere made the common brothels of the town
there virgins honourable vows received
but chaste as maids in monasteries lived
the king himself to nuptial ties a slave
no bad example to his poets gave
and they not bad but in a vicious age
had not to please the prince debauchd the stage


now what should arthur do he loved the knight
but sovereign monarchs are the source of right
moved by the damsels tears and common cry
he doomd the brutal ravisher to die
but fair geneura rose in his defence
and prayd so hard for mercy from the prince
that to his queen the king the offender gave
and left it in her power to kill or save
this gracious act the ladies all approve
who thought it much a man should die for love


and with their mistress joind in close debate
covering their kindness with dissembled hate
if not to free him to prolong his fate


at last agreed they call him by consent
before the queen and female parliament
and the fair speaker rising from the chair
did thus the judgment of the house declare


sir knight though i have askd thy life yet still
thy destiny depends upon my will
nor hast thou other surety than the grace
not due to thee from our offended race
but as our kind is of a softer mould
and cannot blood without a sigh behold
i grant thee life reserving still the power
to take the forfeit when i see my hour
unless thy answer to my next demand
shall set thee free from our avenging hand


the question whose solution i require
is what the sex of women most desire
in this dispute thy judges are at strife
beware for on thy wit depends thy life
yet lest surprised unknowing what to say
thou damn thyself we give thee farther day
a year is thine to wander at thy will
and learn from others if thou wantst the skill
but not to hold our proffer turnd to scorn
good sureties will we have for thy return
that at the time prefixd thou shalt obey
and at thy pledges peril keep thy day


woe was the knight at this severe command
but well he knew twas bootless to withstand
the terms accepted as the fair ordain
he put in bail for his return again
and promised answer at the day assignd
the best with heavens assistance he could find


his leave thus taken on his way he went
with heavy heart and full of discontent
misdoubting much and fearful of the event


twas hard the truth of such a point to find
as was not yet agreed among the kind
thus on he went still anxious more and more
askd all he met and knockd at every door
inquired of men but made his chief request
to learn from women what they loved the best
they answerd each according to her mind
to please herself not all the female kind
one was for wealth another was for place
crones old and ugly wishd a better face


the widows wish was oftentimes to wed
the wanton maids were all for sport abed
some said the sex were pleased with handsome lies
and some gross flattery loved without disguise
truth is says one he seldom fails to win
who flatters well for thats our darling sin
but long attendance and a duteous mind
will work even with the wisest of the kind


one thought the sexs prime felicity
was from the bonds of wedlock to be free
their pleasures hours and actions all their own
and uncontrolld to give account to none
some wish a husbandfool but such are cursed
for fools perverse of husbands are the worst
all women would be counted chaste and wise
nor should our spouses see but with our eyes
for fools will prate and though they want the wit
to find close faults yet open blots will hit


though better for their ease to hold their tongue
for womankind was never in the wrong
so noise ensues and quarrels last for life
the wife abhors the fool the fool the wife
and some men say that great delight have we
to be for truth extolld and secrecy
and constant in one purpose still to dwell
and not our husbands counsels to reveal
but thats a fable for our sex is frail
inventing rather than not tell a tale
like leaky sieves no secrets we can hold
witness the famous tale that ovid told


midas the king as in his book appears
by phoebus was endowd with asss ears
which under his long locks he well conceald
as monarchs vices must not be reveald
for fear the people have them in the wind
who long ago were neither dumb nor blind
nor apt to think from heaven their title springs
since jove and mars left off begetting kings
this midas knew and durst communicate
to none but to his wife his ears of state
one must be trusted and he thought her fit
as passing prudent and a parlous wit
to this sagacious confessor he went
and told her what a gift the gods had sent


but told it under matrimonial seal
with strict injunction never to reveal
the secret heard she plighted him her troth
and sacred sure is every womans oath
the royal malady should rest unknown
both for her husbands honour and her own
but neertheless she pined with discontent
the counsel rumbled till it found a vent


the thing she knew she was obliged to hide
by interest and by oath the wife was tied
but if she told it not the woman died


loath to betray a husband and a prince
but she must burst or blab and no pretence
of honour tied her tongue from selfdefence


a marshy ground commodiously was near
thither she ran and held her breath for fear
lest if a word she spoke of any thing
that word might be the secret of the king
thus full of counsel to the fen she went
griped all the way and longing for a vent


arrived by pure necessity compelld
on her majestic marrowbones she kneeld
then to the waters brink she laid her head
and as a bittourg i bumps within a reed
to thee alone o lake she said i tell
and as thy queen command thee to conceal
beneath his locks the king my husband wears
a goodly royal pair of asss ears
now i have eased my bosom of the pain
till the next longing fit return again


thus through a woman was the secret known
tell us and in effect you tell the town
but to my tale the knight with heavy cheer
wandering in vain had now consumed the year
one day was only left to solve the doubt
yet knew no more than when he first set out
but home he must and as the award had been
yield up his body captive to the queen
in this despairing state he happd to ride
as fortune led him by a forest side
lonely the vale and full of horror stood
brown with the shade of a religious wood
when full before him at the noon of night
the moon was up and shot a gleamy light


he saw a quire of ladies in a round
that featly footing seemd to skim the ground
thus dancing hand in hand so light they were
he knew not where they trod on earth or air


at speed he drove and came a sudden guest
in hope where many women were at least
some one by chance might answer his request


but faster than his horse the ladies flew
and in a trice were vanishd out of view
one only hag remaind but fouler far
than grandame apes in indian forests are


against a witherd oak she leand her weight
proppd on her trusty staff not half upright
and droppd an awkward courtesy to the knight


then said what makes you sir so late abroad
without a guide and this no beaten road
or want you aught that here you hope to find
or travel for some trouble in your mind
the last i guess and if i read aright
those of our sex are bound to serve a knight
perhaps good counsel may your grief assuage
then tell your pain for wisdom is in age


to this the knight good mother would you know
the secret cause and spring of all my woe
my life must with tomorrows light expire
unless i tell what women most desire
now could you help me at this hard essay
or for your inborn goodness or for pay
yours is my life redeemd by your advice
ask what you please and i will pay the price
the proudest kerchief of the court shall rest
well satisfied of what they love the best
plight me thy faith quoth she that what i ask
thy danger over and performd thy task
that thou shalt give for hire of thy demand
here take thy oath and seal it on my hand
i warrant thee on peril of my life
thy words shall please both widow maid and wife


more words there needed not to move the knight
to take her offer and his truth to plight
with that she spread a mantle on the ground
and first inquiring whither he was bound
bade him not fear though long and rough the way
at court he should arrive ere break of day


his horse should find the way without a guide
she said with fury they began to ride
he on the midst the beldam at his side


the horse what devil drove i cannot tell
but only this they sped their journey well
and all the way the crone informd the knight
how he should answer the demand aright


to court they came the news was quickly spread
of his returning to redeem his head
the female senate was assembled soon
with all the mob of women in the town
the queen sat lord chiefjustice of the hall
and bade the crier cite the criminal
the knight appeard and silence they proclaim
then first the culprit answerd to his name
and after forms of law was last required
to name the thing that women most desired


the offender taught his lesson by the way
and by his counsel orderd what to say
thus bold began my lady liege said he
what all your sex desire is sovereignty
the wife affects her husband to command
all must be hers both money house and land
the maids are mistresses even in their name
and of their servants full dominion claim


this at the peril of my head i say
a blunt plain truth the sex aspires to sway
you to rule all while we like slaves obey


there was not one or widow maid or wife
but said the knight had well deserved his life
even fair geneura with a blush confessd
the man had found what women love the best


upstarts the beldam who was there unseen
and reverence made accosted thus the queen
my liege said she before the court arise
may i poor wretch find favour in your eyes
to grant my just request twas i who taught
the knight this answer and inspired his thought
none but a woman could a man direct
to tell us women what we most affect
but first i swore him on his knightly troth
and here demand performance of his oath


to grant the boon that next i should desire
he gave his faith and i expect my hire
my promise is fulfilld i saved his life
and claim his debt to take me for his wife
the knight was askd nor could his oath deny
but hoped they would not force him to comply
the women who would rather wrest the laws
than let a sisterplaintiff lose the cause
as judges on the bench more gracious are
and more attent to brothers of the bar
cried one and all the suppliant should have right
and to the grandame hag adjudged the knight


in vain he sighd and oft with tears desired
some reasonable suit might be required
but still the crone was constant to her note
the more he spoke the more she stretchd her throat
in vain he profferd all his goods to save
his body destined to that living grave
the liquorish hag rejects the pelf with scorn
and nothing but the man would serve her turn
not all the wealth of eastern kings said she
have power to part my plighted love and me
and old and ugly as i am and poor
yet never will i break the faith i swore
for mine thou art by promise during life
and i thy loving and obedient wife


my love nay rather my damnation thou
said he nor am i bound to keep my vow
the fiend thy sire hath sent thee from below
else how couldst thou my secret sorrows know


avaunt old witch for i renounce thy bed
the queen may take the forfeit of my head
ere any of my race so foul a crone shall wed


both heard the judge pronounced against the knight
so was he married in his own despite


and all day after hid him as an owl
not able to sustain a sight so foul
perhaps the reader thinks i do him wrong
to pass the marriage feast and nuptial song
mirth there was none the man was _alamort_
and little courage had to make his court
to bed they went the bridegroom and the bride
was never such an illpaird couple tied


restless he tossd and tumbled to and fro
and rolld and wriggled further off for woe
the good old wife lay smiling by his side
and caught him in her quivering arms and cried


when you my ravishd predecessor saw
you were not then become this man of straw
had you been such you might have scaped the law


is this the custom of king arthurs court
are all roundtable knights of such a sort
remember i am she who saved your life
your loving lawful and complying wife
not thus you swore in your unhappy hour
nor i for this return employd my power
in time of need i was your faithful friend
nor did i since nor ever will offend
believe me my loved lord tis much unkind
what fury has possessd your alterd mind


thus on my wedding nightwithout pretence
come turn this way or tell me my offence
if not your wife let reasons rule persuade
name but my fault amends shall soon be made
amends nay thats impossible said he
what change of age or ugliness can be


or could medeas magic mend thy face
thou art descended from so mean a race
that never knight was matchd with such disgrace


what wonder madam if i move my side
when if i turn i turn to such a bride
and is this all that troubles you so sore
and what the devil couldst thou wish me more
ah benedicite replied the crone
then cause of just complaining have you none
the remedy to this were soon applied
would you be like the bridegroom to the bride
but for you say a long descended race
and wealth and dignity and power and place


make gentlemen and that your high degree
is much disparaged to be matchd with me
know this my lord nobility of blood
is but a glittering and fallacious good
the nobleman is he whose noble mind
is filld with inborn worth unborrowd from his kind
the king of heaven was in a manger laid
and took his earth but from an humble maid
then what can birth or mortal men bestow
since floods no higher than their fountains flow
we who for name and empty honour strive
our true nobility from him derive
your ancestors who puff your mind with pride
and vast estates to mighty titles tied
did not your honour but their own advance
for virtue comes not by inheritance


if you tralineate from your fathers mind
what are you else but of a bastard kind
do as your great progenitors have done
and by their virtues prove yourself their son
no father can infuse or wit or grace
a mother comes across and mars the race
a grandsire or a grandame taints the blood
and seldom three descents continue good
were virtue by descent a noble name
could never villanise his fathers fame
but as the first the last of all the line
would like the sun even in descending shine
take fire and bear it to the darkest house
betwixt king arthurs court and caucasus


if you depart the flame shall still remain
and the bright blaze enlighten all the plain
nor till the fuel perish can decay
by nature formd on things combustible to prey
such is not man who mixing better seed
with worse begets a base degenerate breed
the bad corrupts the good and leaves behind
no trace of all the great begetters mind
the father sinks within his son we see
and often rises in the third degree
if better luck a better mother give
chance gave us being and by chance we live


such as our atoms were even such are we
or call it chance or strong necessity
thus loaded with dead weight the will is free


and thus it needs must be for seed conjoind
lets into natures work the imperfect kind
but fire the enlivener of the general frame
is one its operation still the same


its principle is in itself while ours
works as confederates war with mingled powers
or man or woman which soever fails
and oft the vigour of the worse prevails
aether with sulphur blended alters hue
and casts a dusky gleam of sodom blue
thus in a brute their ancient honour ends
and the fair mermaid in a fish descends
the line is gone no longer duke or earl
but by himself degraded turns a churl


nobility of blood is but renown
of thy great fathers by their virtue known
and a long trail of light to thee descending down


if in thy smoke it ends their glories shine
but infamy and villanage are thine
then what i said before is plainly showd
the true nobility proceeds from god
nor left us by inheritance but given
by bounty of our stars and grace of heaven
thus from a captive servius tullius rose
whom for his virtues the first romans chose


fabricius from their walls repelld the foe
whose noble hands had exercised the plough
from hence my lord and love i thus conclude
that though my homely ancestors were rude
mean as i am yet i may have the grace
to make you father of a generous race
and noble then am i when i begin
in virtue clothed to cast the rags of sin
if poverty be my upbraided crime
and you believe in heaven there was a time


when he the great controller of our fate
deignd to be man and lived in low estate
which he who had the world at his dispose
if poverty were vice would never choose
philosophers have said and poets sing
that a glad povertys an honest thing
content is wealth the riches of the mind
and happy he who can that treasure find


but the base miser starves amidst his store
broods on his gold and griping still at more
sits sadly pining and believes hes poor


the ragged beggar though he want relief
has not to lose and sings before the thief
want is a bitter and a hateful good
because its virtues are not understood
yet many things impossible to thought
have been by need to full perfection brought
the daring of the soul proceeds from thence
sharpness of wit and active diligence
prudence at once and fortitude it gives
and if in patience taken mends our lives
for even that indigence that brings me low
makes me myself and him above to know


a good which none would challenge few would choose
a fair possession which mankind refuse
if we from wealth to poverty descend
want gives to know the flatterer from the friend
if i am old and ugly well for you
no lewd adulterer will my love pursue


nor jealousy the bane of married life
shall haunt you for a witherd homely wife
for age and ugliness as all agree
are the best guards of female chastity
yet since i see your mind is worldly bent
ill do my best to further your content
and therefore of two gifts in my dispose
think ere you speak i grant you leave to choose
would you i should be still deformd and old
nauseous to touch and loathsome to behold


on this condition to remain for life
a careful tender and obedient wife
in all i can contribute to your ease
and not in deed or word or thought displease
or would you rather have me young and fair
and take the chance that happens to your share
temptations are in beauty and in youth
and how can you depend upon my truth
now weigh the danger with the doubtful bliss
and thank yourself if aught should fall amiss


sore sighd the knight who this long sermon heard
at length considering all his heart he cheerd
and thus replied my lady and my wife
to your wise conduct i resign my life
choose you for me for well you understand
the future good and ill on either hand
but if an humble husband may request
provide and order all things for the best
yours be the care to profit and to please
and let your subject servant take his ease


then thus in peace quoth she concludes the strife
since i am turnd the husband you the wife
the matrimonial victory is mine
which having fairly gaind i will resign
forgive if i have said or done amiss
and seal the bargain with a friendly kiss
i promised you but one content to share
but now i will become both good and fair
no nuptial quarrel shall disturb your ease
the business of my life shall be to please
and for my beauty that as time shall try
but draw the curtain first and cast your eye


he lookd and saw a creature heavenly fair
in bloom of youth and of a charming air
with joy he turnd and seized her ivory arm
and like pygmalion found the statue warm
small arguments there needed to prevail
a storm of kisses pourd as thick as hail
thus long in mutual bliss they lay embraced
and their first love continued to the last
one sunshine was their life no cloud between
nor ever was a kinder couple seen


and so may all our lives like theirs be led
heaven send the maids young husbands fresh in bed
may widows wed as often as they can
and ever for the better change their man
and some devouring plague pursue their lives
who will not well be governd by their wives


a parish priest was of the pilgrim train
an awful reverend and religious man
his eyes diffused a venerable grace
and charity itself was in his face


rich was his soul though his attire was poor
as god had clothed his own ambassador
for such on earth his blessd redeemer bore


of sixty years he seemd and well might last
to sixty more but that he lived too fast


refined himself to soul to curb the sense
and made almost a sin of abstinence
yet had his aspect nothing of severe
but such a face as promised him sincere


nothing reserved or sullen was to see
but sweet regards and pleasing sanctity
mild was his accent and his action free


with eloquence innate his tongue was armd
though harsh the precept yet the preacher charmd
for letting down the golden chain from high
he drew his audience upward to the sky


and oft with holy hymns he charmd their ears
a music more melodious than the spheres
for david left him when he went to rest
his lyre and after him he sung the best
he bore his great commission in his look
but sweetly temperd awe and softend all he spoke


he preachd the joys of heaven and pains of hell
and warnd the sinner with becoming zeal
but on eternal mercy loved to dwell


he taught the gospel rather than the law
and forced himself to drive but loved to draw


for fear but freezes minds but love like heat
exhales the soul sublime to seek her native seat
to threats the stubborn sinner oft is hard
wrappd in his crimes against the storm prepared
but when the milder beams of mercy play
he melts and throws his cumbrous cloak away
lightning and thunder heavens artillery
as harbingers before the almighty fly
those but proclaim his style and disappear
the stiller sound succeeds and god is there


the tithes his parish freely paid he took
but never sued or cursed with bell and book
with patience bearing wrong but offering none
since every man is free to lose his own
the country churls according to their kind
who grudge their dues and love to be behind
the less he sought his offerings pinchd the more
and praised a priest contented to be poor


yet of his little he had some to spare
to feed the famishd and to clothe the bare
for mortified he was to that degree
a poorer than himself he would not see
true priests he said and preachers of the word
were only stewards of their sovereign lord
nothing was theirs but all the public store
intrusted riches to relieve the poor
who should they steal for want of his relief
he judged himself accomplice with the thief


wide was his parish not contracted close
in streets but here and there a straggling house
yet still he was at hand without request
to serve the sick to succour the distressd
tempting on foot alone without affright
the dangers of a dark tempestuous night


all this the good old man performd alone
nor spared his pains for curate he had none
nor durst he trust another with his care
nor rode himself to pauls the public fair
to chaffer for preferment with his gold
where bishoprics and sinecures are sold


but duly watchd his flock by night and day
and from the prowling wolf redeemd the prey
and hungry sent the wily fox away


the proud he tamed the penitent he cheerd
nor to rebuke the rich offender feard
his preaching much but more his practice wrought
a living sermon of the truths he taught
for this by rules severe his life he squared
that all might see the doctrine which they heard
for priests he said are patterns for the rest
the gold of heaven who bear the god impressd
but when the precious coin is kept unclean
the sovereigns image is no longer seen
if they be foul on whom the people trust
well may the baser brass contract a rust


the prelate for his holy life he prized
the worldly pomp of prelacy despised
his saviour came not with a gaudy show
nor was his kingdom of the world below


patience in want and poverty of mind
these marks of church and churchmen he designd
and living taught and dying left behind


the crown he wore was of the pointed thorn
in purple he was crucified not born
they who contend for place and high degree
are not his sons but those of zebedee


not but he knew the signs of earthly power
might well become saint peters successor
the holy father holds a double reign
the prince may keep his pomp the fisher must be plain


such was the saint who shone with every grace
reflecting moseslike his makers face
god saw his image lively was expressd
and his own work as in creation blessd


the tempter saw him too with envious eye
and as on job demanded leave to try
he took the time when richard was deposed
and high and low with happy harry closed
this prince though great in arms the priest withstood
near though he was yet not the next of blood


had richard unconstraind resignd the throne
a king can give no more than is his own
the title stood entaild had richard had a son


conquest an odious name was laid aside
where all submitted none the battle tried
the senseless plea of right by providence
was by a flattering priest invented since
and lasts no longer than the present sway
but justifies the next who comes in play


the peoples right remains let those who dare
dispute their power when they the judges are


he joind not in their choice because he knew
worse might and often did from change ensue
much to himself he thought but little spoke
and undeprived his benefice forsook


now through the land his cure of souls he stretchd
and like a primitive apostle preachd
still cheerful ever constant to his call
by many followd loved by most admired by all
with what he beggd his brethren he relieved
and gave the charities himself received
gave while he taught and edified the more
because he showed by proof twas easy to be poor


he went not with the crowd to see a shrine
but fed us by the way with food divine


in deference to his virtues i forbear
to show you what the rest in orders were
this brilliant is so spotless and so bright
he needs no foil but shines by his own proper light


jack friend if im late excuse the failing
and think that reasons much prevailing
have kept me for an house or better
since i received your tempting letter
from this dear scene of joy and drinking
and evry licence of freethinking
but tell me whos this rustick fellow
that looks as spleenatick and yellow
as if his revrend parson awd him

to hear all beings provd mechanick

tom be easy jack and you this bumpkin
shall quickly find is good for something
who may be moulded to our wishes
by wine and wit and savry dishes
and if hes plyant as his name is
well worth the case youll find the game is
in youth pedantick tutors bred him
and with half notions crudely fed him
the town as hell inform you fully
next turnd him to a take and bully
the country since has been his station
where hes a patriot out of fashion
stickles for monarchy and orders
with all that on religion borders
on which so shrewdly he discourses
he mawls sometimes our new raisd forces


but were uncivil heres your health sir
tis hopd youll pardon we freethinkers
are unconfind and lawless drinkers
and whatsoever suits or pleases
or for our profit or our ease is
we never baulk it or ill breeding
is now esteemd this frank proceeding


plyant i thank you sir for this instruction
which did not need an introduction
for all that i shall see you practice
i will conclude still most exact is
i formerly with wits and roarers
with bullyrocks and bilking scorers
was usd to herd and calld a ranter
and in the pit could vizars banter
but since reflecting on that folly
i can no more be loud and jolly
but fort he time to come shall spend it
like one that knows he soon must end it
yet real wit thats chast and sober
heightend a little with october
whether expressd in words or writing
will to my deathbed be delighting


tom champaigne will surely raise it faster
believe me who have been your taster
a flask of this for your half guinea
will stir up all thats bright within ye
support you when enclind to sinking
and teach your pleasure and freethinking


ply why sir my thoughts were never bounded
but still have all the globe surrounded
recalld the past and reachd the future
unhelpd by such a costly tutor
but this freethinking pray what is it
if wit methinks i would not miss it


or see again my native mansion
unlearnd in any new invention
and sure a cant will bear rehearsal
which is become so universal
that even the drawer to my admiring
answerd me when you for you inquiring
you woud be here i need not doubt you
freethinkers coud not live without you
that tables his quote he depend ont
he always sits at thupper end ont
and talks such wonders to the youngsters
they know not if theyre men or monsters
but yet of this so clear tis stated
theyre sure they never were created


but first sprung up they know not where
now when nor how twill make you stare
to hear him whilst they do adore him
make fools of all that went before him


a damsel next both young and pretty
cryd welcome landlord to this city
and clappd me roundly on the shoulder
no army trull was ever bolder
and when i askd her who had taught her
such impudence and hither brought her
she answerd mincing in her manners
freethinkers sir i thank their honours
which makes me find youve condescended
by every rank to be attended
and your new doctrine grave or frolick
has spread as if twere apostolick


tom we have indeed the world enlightend
and boys and girls are not so frightend
with god and evi taught at random
in nurseries by palsied granam
as heretofore were men and matrons
freethinking sir has mighty patrons


ply but may an honest man relie ont
tom jack heres a health to lady plyant
methinks she seldom comes to town sir
ply why tis so hard to get her down sir
but this freethinking pray explain it
for if a man should over strain it
what sees at first but whim and notion
may clash with honour and devotion
with magna charta or superiors
and make us think theres no inferiors
but all were born upon the level
and equally should sway and revel


jack intolerable can you like him
tom hell soon be drunk and then well strike him
unfold our latitude opinions
and add him to our large dominions


tom your son your second
he a freethinker has been reckond
a man of wondrou sense and mettal
fit to unhinge and then resettle
to lose the bands whch education
imposes on a free born nation
to show how life shoud slide along
unheeding hwats to come or gone
how self we always shoud consider
and follow still the fairest bidder
snatch in the nick the good thats certain
nor mind whats hid behind the curtain


ply why if you mean young richard plyant
he shall scale heaven with any gyant
who of lycurgus talks and solon
and is old dog at dobbs and toland
knows all republican defences
and raves on cato uticensis
with tother of that name and brutus
he daily labours to confute us
when adam dug and eve set onions
he says that all men were companions
that kings were made but for the people
as for the church was made the steeple
which tho it highest stands and fair is
to make them meet its only care is
and whilst that noise and pomp possesses
the people tis must lay the cesses
that tis but as the people bawl
unto whose share the ropes should fall
and when it sinks by age or weather
the people must erect another


tom perfect allusion strong and valid
i neer heard argument so solid
why heres a lad all flame and spirit
sir disinherit disinherit
leave not the eldest born an acre
but raise this generous undertaker
in london let him still be gallant
and much with us to mend his talent
encouragd by our daring papers
and growling talk of spleen and vapors
with equipage and gold enough
and let him be interrd in snuff
and smyrna for his house be noted
and he for early news be quoted
which if contested let a wager
profusely big cofute thengager


ply how dick have all have giles offended

tho moll could spend a mighty fortune
and for supplies does still importune
is grown a writer and a rattler
and evry moment quotes the tattler
to operas she sweekly flutters
and mirlst sic her talking verses sputters
and when i bid her leave that tone
she sings ill live for you alone
i tell her that she goes too fine
she sings oh nymph of race divine
i chancd to read upon her toe
she singing screamd out cupid oh
besides the charge each time she hears it
woud buy a shift her mother swears it


jack shes a freethinker i imagine
and all thats witty does engage in
but her last fault youll see amended
for operas will soon be ended
since ridicule thats so subduing
has now contrivd its total ruin
and though indeed it bore the proof
of bread and butter round the loaf
and still kept ground before our plays
though hackd and hewd by poet bays
a waggish title now must blast it
and punchs opera will cast it


ply i am glad twill down but why that tool
is reason less then ridicule


jack oh sir by much all mortals fear it
and neither man nor brute can bear it
when ive but then my finger pointed
and with screwd looks my face disjointed
my dog i have uneasy seen
tom jack you forget hes a machine


jack there is a tract ill say no more

all that he got was to be basted
nor woud the greeks have lost elysium

tho brittons would it seems have given
for smart buffooning all their heaven


jack they had reignd to ridiculing
ply and wittily been damnd for fooling


jack make that the subject of your laughter
theres nothing sir to come hereafter


tom freethinking rescues from that error
which keeps you in this constant terror


ply why them what you freethinking call
i find is not to think at all
and savages through want of breeding
are what you grow by dint of reading
my carter saw my father buried
and as to earth his corps was carried
farewel quoth he my good old master
you and your mare who dyed last easter
shall now no more know joys or flashes
but be for ever dust and ashes


tom well said brave hobb is such freethinking
down to the dull plebean sinking
and so the clowns talk at this rate too
ply then fools were socrates and plato
though once esteemd both wise and great
for tracing out a future state


jack woud you be still then so confind
nor free in body nor in mind


ply why sir were i all air or fire
what freedom more coud i desire
wod not with others rights make bold
and whats my own is all freehold


tom but wheres the taste in such posessing
the pleasure sure is in transgressing
in doing what another dare not
and showing we for statutes care not
were i but stronger than my neighbours
id reap the fruit of all their labours
a fellow that withheld his wife
cause by the priest bestowd for life
should instantly be sackd and plunderd
and usd the worst in all the hundred
had i a naboth on each side me
wh had a field or grove denyd me
in that my team by force shoud enter
and this shoud warm my hearth in winter
the church if to my house was joynd
shoud with my orange trees be lind
the parson if she still woud keep it
should trim the boughs and dayly sweep it
his surplice in true blue being dyd
shoud aprons for the work provide


jack those fellows are indeed a burden
and shoud to plough or to the garden
whore always preaching low submission
and clog the paths to bold ambition


ply but for this vigorous employment
this self providing this enjoyment
i can discern no proper season
unless brought in by war and treason
and i have still been wondrous loath
to violate the allegiance oath


tom sir i am much surprizd at finding
you think a trivial oath so binding
swearing in taverns or the temple
differ but only in thexample
one leads the mob to soar and hector
tother to sneak to some protector
for men of sense twas neer intended
but for the countenance they lend it


ply yet in my thought there one thing more is
are you freethinkers whiggs or tories


jack they steadily indeed are neither
occasionally can be either
distinction their large aim disgraces
theyre of no party but for places
scorning all ties divine or civil
ply why this freethinking is the devil
but yet i fear that whilst im trying
with this new scheme to be complying
i shall some book be turning over
with clasps and turkyleather cover
which ill not name awd by my betters
as tis entitld in gold letters


jack youll never stick at those abuses
weve put that book to such odd uses
that is has lost its ancient credit
though few amongst us ever read it

let me this night your presence borrow
ply the money must be paid to morrow

theyll make you wait till twelve or one

and youre not well yet of your journey

and when tis ready for conveying
dispatch my man to give you warning
who may til then sleep out the morning

jack so you had need for fear of dogging
or being with that toledo haunted
nay prethee thomas be not daunted


tom not daunted when you talk of murder
what if in this we went no further


jack not any thing woud them come of it
and the attempt without the profit
woud wrong the judgment of freethinkers
tom great wits from dangers have been shrinkers
therefore tis fixd ill not pursue it

as mercry travelld thro a wood
whose errands are more fleet than good
an elephant before him lay
that much encumberd had the way
the messenger whos still in haste
woud fain have bowd and so have past
when up arose th unweildy brute
and woud repeat a late dispute


in which he said hed gaind the prize
from a wild boar of monstrous size
but fame quoth he with all her tongues
who lawyers ladies soldiers wrongs
has to my disadvantage told
an action throughly bright and bold
has said that i foul play had usd
and with my weight th opposer bruisd
had laid my trunk about his brawn
before his tushes coud be drawn
had stunnd him with a hideous roar
and twentythousand scandals more
but i defy the talk of men

or shoud my friends excuses frame
and beg the criticks not to blame
since from a female hand it came
defects in judgment or in wit

our vanity we more betray
in asking what the world will say
than if in trivial things like these
we wait on the event with ease
nor make long prefaces to show
what men are not concernd to know
for still untouchd how we succeed
tis for themselves not us they read


whilst that proceeding to requite
we own who in the muse delight
tis for our selves not them we write
betrayd by solitude to try
amusements which the prosprous fly


and only to the press repair
to fix our scatterd papers there
tho whilst our labours are preservd
the printers may indeed be starvd


how vain is life which rightly we compare
to flying posts that haste away
to plants that fade with the declining day
to clouds that sail amidst the yielding air
till by extention into that they flow
or scattring on the world below
are lost and gone ere we can say they were
to autumnleaves which every wind can chace
to rising bubbles on the waters face
to fleeting dreams that will not stay


nor in th abused fancy dance
when the returning rays of light
resuming their alternate right
break on th illorderd scene on the fantastick trance
as weak is man whilst tenant to the earth
as frail and as uncertain all his ways
from the first moment of his weeping birth
down to the last and best of his few restless days
when to the land of darkness he retires
from disappointed hopes and frustrated desires
reaping no other fruit of all his pain
bestowd whilst in the vale of tears below
but this unhappy truth at last to know
that vanitys our lot and all mankind is vain


if past the hazard of his tendrest years
neither in thoughtless sleep opprest
nor poisond with a tainted breast
loosd from the infant bands and female cares


a studious boy advancd beyond his age
wastes the dim lamp and turns the restless page
for some lovd book prevents the rising day
and on it stoln aside bestows the hours of play
him the observing master dos design
for search of darkned truths and mysteries divine
bids him with unremitted labour trace
the rise of empires and their various fates
the several tyrants oer the several states
to babels lofty towers and warlike nimrods race
bids him in paradice the bank survey
where man newmoulded from the temperd clay
till fird with breath divine a helpless figure lay
could he be led thus farwhat were the boast
what the reward of all the toil it cost
what from that land of everblooming spring
for our instruction could he bring
unless that having humane nature found
unseparated from its parent ground


howeer we vaunt our elevated birth
the epicure in soft array
the lothsome beggar that before
his rude unhospitable door
unpityd but by brutes a broken carcass lay
were both alike derivd from the same common earth
but ere the child can to these heights attain
ere he can in the learned sphere arise
a guilding star attracting to the skies
a fever seizing the oer labourd brain
sends him perhaps to deaths concealing shade
where in the marble tomb now silent laid
he better dos that useful doctrine show
which all the sad assistants ought to know
who round the grave his short continuance mourn
that first from dust we came and must to dust return


a bolder youth grown capable of arms
bellona courts with her prevailing charms


bids th inchanting trumpet sound
loud as triumph soft as love
striking now the poles above
then descending from the skies
soften every falling note
as the harmonious lark that sings and flies
when near the earth contracts her narrow throat
and warbles on the ground


shews the proud steed impatient of the check
gainst the loudest terrors proof
pawing the valley with his steeled hoof
with lightning armd his eyes with thunder clothd his neck
who on the th advanced foe the signal givn
flies like a rushing storm by mighty whirlwinds drivn
lays open the records of fame
no glorious deed omits no man of mighty name
their stratagems their tempers shell repeat
from alexanders truly stild the great


from cæsars on the worlds imperial seat
to turennes conduct and to condes heat
tis done and now th ambitious youth disdains
the safe but harder labours of the gown
the softer pleasures of the courtly town
the once lovd rural sports and chaces on the plains
does with the soldiers life the garb assume
the gold embroidries and the graceful plume
walks haughty in a coat of scarlet die
a colour well contrivd to cheat the eye
where richer blood alas may undistinguisht lye
and oh too near that wretched fate attends
hear it ye parents all ye weeping friends
thou fonder maid won by these gaudy charms
the destind prize of his victorious arms
now fainting dye upon the mournful sound
that speaks his hasty death and paints the fatal wound


trail all your pikes dispirit every drum
march in a slow procession from afar
ye silent ye dejected men of war
be still the hautboys and the flute be dumb
display no more in vain the lofty banner
for see where on the bier before ye lies
the pale the falln th untimely sacrifice
to your mistaken shrine to your false idol honour


as vain is beauty and as short her power
tho in its proud and transitory sway
the coldest hearts and wisest heads obey
that gay fantastick tyrant of an hour
on beautys charms altho a fathers right
tho grave seleucus to thy royal side
by holy vows fair stratonice be tyd
with anxious joy with dangerous delight
too often gazes thy unwary son
till past all hopes expiring and undone


a speaking pulse the secret cause impart
the only time when the physicians art
could ease that labring grief or heal a lovers smart
see great antonius now impatient stand
expecting with mistaken pride
on cydnus crowded shore on cydnus fatal strand
a queen at his tribunal to be tryd
a queen that armd in beauty shall deride
his feeble rage and his whole fate command
oer the still waves her burnisht galley moves
rowd by the graces whilst officious loves
to silken cords their busie hands apply
or gathering all the gentle gales that fly
to their fair mistress with these spoils repair
and from their purple wings disperse the balmy air
hovring perfumes ascend in odrous clouds
curl oer the barque and play among the shrouds


whilst gently dashing every silver oar
guided by the rules of art
with tuneful instruments designd
to soften and subdue the stubborn mind
a strangely pleasing and harmonious part
in equal measures bore


like a new venus on her native sea
in midst of the transporting scene
which pen or pencil imitates in vain
on a resplendent and conspicuous bed
with all the pride of persia loosely spread
the lovely syrene lay
which but discernd from the yet distant shore
th amazed emperor could hate no more
no more a baffled vengeance could pursue
but yielding still still as she nearer drew
when cleopatra anchord in the bay
where every charm coud all its force display
like his own statue stood and gazd the world away


where ends alas this pageantry and state
where end the triumphs of this conquring face
envyd of roman wives and all the female race
oh swift vicissitude of beautys fate
now in her tomb withdrawn from publick sight
from near captivity and shame
the vanquishd the abandond dame
proffers the arm that held anothers right
to the destructive snakes more just embrace
and courts deforming death to mend his leaden pace


but wit shall last the vaunting poet cries
th immortal streams that from parnassus flow
shall make his neverfading lawrels grow
above this mouldring earth to flourish in the skies


and when his body falls in funeral fire
when late revolving ages shall consume
the very pillars that support his tomb
his name shall live and his best part aspire
deluded wretch grasping at future praise
now planting with mistaken care
round thy enchanted palace in the air
a grove which in thy fancy time shall raise
a grove of soaring palms and everlasting bays


couldst thou alas to such reknown arrive
as thy imagination woud contrive
should numerous cities in a vain contest
struggle for thy famous birth
should the sole monarch of the conquerd earth
his wreathed head upon thy volume rest
like maro couldst thou justly claim
amongst th inspired tuneful race
the highest room the undisputed place
and after near two thousand years of fame


have thy proud work to a new people shown
th unequald poems made their own
in such a dress in such a perfect stile
as on his labours dryden now bestows
as now from drydens just improvement flows
in every polishd verse throughout the british isle
what benefit alas would to thee grow
what sense of pleasure woudst thou know
what swelling joy what pride what glory have
when in the darkness of the abject grave
insensible and stupid laid below
no atom of thy heap no dust woud move
for all the airy breath that formd thy praise above


true says the man to luxury inclind
without the study of uncertain art
without much labour of the mind
meer uninstructed nature will impart
that life too swiftly flies and leaves all good behind


sieze then my friends he cries the present hour
the pleasure which to that belongs
the feasts th oerflowing bowls the mirth the songs
the orangebloom that with such sweetness blows
anacreons celebrated rose
the hyacinth with every beauteous flower
which just this happy moment shall disclose
are out of fortunes reach and all within our power
such costly garments let our slaves prepare
as for the gay demetrius were designd
where a new sun of radiant diamonds shind
where the enameld earth and scarcediscerned air
with a transparent sea were seen
a sea composed of the emralds green


and with a golden shore encompassd round
where every orient shell of wondrous shape was found
the whole creation on his shoulders hung
the whole creation with his wish complyd
did swiftly for each appetite provide
and fed them all when young
no less th assyrian prince enjoyd
of bliss too soon deprivd but never cloyd
whose counsel let us still pursue
whose monument did this inscription shew
to every passenger that trod the way
where with a slighting hand and scornful smile
the proud effigies on th instructive pile
a great example lay
i here entombd did mighty kingdoms sway
two cities raisd in one prodigious day


thou wandring traveller no longer gaze
no longer dwell upon this useless place
go feed and drink in sports consume thy life
for all that else we gains not worth a moments strife
thus talks the fool whom no restraint can bound
when now the glass has gone a frequent round
when soaring fancy lightly swims
fancy that keeps above and dances oer the brims


whilst weighty reason sinks and in the bottoms drownd
adds to his own an artificial fire
doubling evry hot desire
till th auxiliary spirits in a flame
the stomachs magazine defy
that standing pool that helpless moisture nigh
thro every vital part impetuous fly
and quite consume the frame
when to the underworld despisd he goes
a pamperd carcase on the worms bestows


who rioting on the unusual chear
as good a life enjoy as he could boast of here


but hold my muse thy farther flight restrain
exhaust not thy declining force
nor in a long pursud and breathless course
attempt with slackend speed to run
through evry vanity beneath the sun
lest thy oerwearyd reader should complain
that of all vanities beside
which thine or his experience eer have tryd
thou art too tedious muse most frivolous and vain
yet tell the man of an aspiring thought
of an ambitious restless mind
that can no ease no satisfaction find
till neighbring states are to subjection brought
till universal awe enslavd mankind is taught


that should he lead an army to the field
for whose still necessary use
th extended earth coud not enough produce
nor rivers to their thirst a full contentment yield
yet must their dark reverse of fate
roll round within that course of years
within the short the swift and fleeting date
prescribd by xerxes when his falling tears
bewaild those numbers which his sword employd
and false hyenalike lamented and destroyd
tell him that does some stately building raise
a windsor or versailles erect
and thorough all posterity expect
with its unshaken base a firm unshaken praise
tell him judeas temple is no more
upon whose splendour thousands heretofore


spent the astonishd hours forgetful to adore
tell him into the earth agen is hurld
that most stupendious wonder of the world
justly presiding oer the boasted seven
by humane art and industry designd
this the rich draught of the immortal mind
the architect of heaven


remember then to fix thy aim on high
project and build on tother side the sky
for after all thy vain expence below
thou canst no fame no lasting pleasure know
no good that shall not thy embraces fly
or thou from that be in a moment caught
thy spirit to new claims new intrests brought
whilst unconcernd thy secret ashes lye
or stray about the globe o man ordaind to dye


a female to a drunkard marryd
when all her other arts miscarryd
had yet one stratagem to prove him
and from good fellowship remove him
finding him overcome with tipple
and weak as infant at the nipple
she to a vault transports the lumber
and there expects his breaking slumber
a table she with meat provided
and robd in black stood just beside it
seen only by one glimring taper
that blewly burnt thro misty vapor
at length he wakes his wine digested
and of her phantomship requested
to learn the name of that close dwelling
and what offends his sight and smelling


and of what land she was the creature
with outspread hair and ghastly feature
mortal quoth she to darkness hurryd
know that thou art both dead and buryd
conveyd last night from noisie tavern
to this thy still and dreary cavern
what strikes thy nose springs from the shatters
of bodies killd with cordial waters
stronger than other scents and quicker
as urgd by more spirituous liquor
my self attend on the deceasd
when all their earthly trains releasd
and in this place of endless quiet
my busness is to find them diet
to shew all sorts of meats and salades
till im acquainted with their palates
but that once known then less suffices
quoth he and on his crupper rises
thou guardian of these lower regions
thou providor for countless legions


thou dark but charitable crony
far kinder than my tisiphony
who of our victuals thus art thinking
if thou hast care too of our drinking
a bumper fetch quoth she a halter
since nothing less thy tone can alter
or break this habit thoust been getting
to keep thy throat in constant wetting


where is that world to which the fancy flies
when sleep excludes the present from our eyes
whose map no voyager coud eer design
nor to description its wild parts confine


yet such a land of dreams we must allow
who nightly trace it tho we know not how
unfetterd by the days obtruded rules
we all enjoy that paradise of fools
and find a sorrow in resuming sense
which breaks some free delight and snatches us from thence


thus in a dream a musselman was shown
a vizir whom he formerly had known
when at the port he bore deputed sway
and made the nations with a nod obey
now all serene and splendid was his brow
whilst ready waiters to his orders bow
his residence an artful garden seemd
adornd with all that pleasant he esteemd
full of reward his glorious lot appeard
as with the sight our dreamers mind was cheard
but turning next he saw a dreadful sight
which filld his soul with wonder and affright


pursud by fiends a wretched dervis fled
through scorching plains which to wide distance spread
whilst every torture gloomy poets paint
was there prepard for the reputed saint
amazd at this the sleeping turk enquires
why he that livd above in soft attires
now rolld in bliss while tother rolld in fires
were taught the suffrings of this future state
th excess of courts is likeliest to create


whilst solitary cells oergrown with shade
the readiest way to paradise is made
true quoth the phantom which he dreamd replyd
the lonely path is still the surest guide
nor is it by these instances denyd
for know my friend whatever fame report
the vizier to retirements woud resort
th ambitious dervis woud frequent the court


a shepherd seeking with his lass
to shun the heat of day
was seated on the shadowd grass
near which a flowing stream did pass
and fish within it play


the phillis he an angle gave
and bid her toss the line
for sure quoth he each fish must have
who dos not seek to be thy slave
a harder heart than mine


assemble here you watry race
transportedly he cries
and if when you behold her face
you eer desire to quit the place
you see not with my eyes


but you perhaps are by the ear
more easie to be caught
if so i have my bagpipe here
the only musick thats not dear
nor in great cities bought


so sprightly was the tune he chose
and often did repeat
that phillis tho not up she rose
kept time with every thrilling close
and jiggd upon her seat


but not a fish woud nearer draw
no harmony or charms
their frozen blood it seems coud thaw
nor all they heard nor all they saw
coud woo them to such terms


the angry shepherd in a pett
gives oer his wheedling arts
and from his shoulder throws the net
resolvd he woud a supper get
by force if not by parts


thus stated laws are always best
to rule the vulgar throng
who grow more stubborn when carest
or with soft rhetorick addrest
if taking measures wrong


reputation love and death
the last all bones the first all breath
the middst composd of restless fire
from each other woud retire
thro the world resolvd to stray
every one a several way
exercising as they went
each such power as fate had lent
which if it united were
wretched mortals coud not bear
but as parting friends do show
to what place they mean to go
correspondence to engage
nominate their utmost stage


death declard he woud be found
near the fatal trumpets sound
or where pestilences reign
and quacks the greater plagues maintain
shaking still his sandy glass
and mowing human flesh like grass
love as next his leave he took
cast on both so sweet a look


as their tempers near disarmd
one relaxd and tother warmd
shades for his retreat he chose
rural plains and soft repose
where no dowry eer was paid
where no jointure eer was made
no ill tongue the nymph perplexd
where no forms the shepherd vexd
where himself shoud be the care
of the fond and of the fair
where that was they soon should know
au revoir then turnd to go


reputation made a pause
suiting her severer laws
second thoughts and third she usd
weighing consequences musd
when at length to both she cryd
you two safely may divide
to th antipodes may fall
and reascend th encompast ball


certain still to meet agen
in the breasts of torturd men
who by one too far betrayd
call in tother to their aid
whilst i tender coy and nice
raisd and ruind in a trice
either fix with those i grace
or abandoning the place
no return my nature bears
from green youth or hoary hairs
if thro guilt or chance i sever
i once parting part for ever


two long had lovd and now the nymph desird
the cloak of wedlock as the case requird
urgd that the day he wrought her to this sorrow
he vowd that he woud marry her tomorrow
agen he swears to shun the present storm
that he tomorrow will that vow perform
the morrows in their due successions came
impatient still on each the pregnant dame
urgd him to keep his word and still he swore the same
when tird at length and meaning no redress
but yet the lye not caring to confess
he for his oath this salvo chose to borrow
that he was free since there was no tomorrow
for when it comes in place to be employd
tis then today tomorrows neer enjoyd


the tales a jest the moral is a truth
tomorrow and tomorrow cheat our youth
in riper age tomorrow still we cry
not thinking that the present day we dye
unpractisd all the good we had designd
theres no tomorrow to a willing mind


give me o indulgent fate
give me yet before i dye
a sweet but absolute retreat
mongst paths so lost and trees so high
that the world may neer invade
through such windings and such shade
my unshaken liberty


no intruders thither come
who visit but to be from home
none who their vain moments pass
only studious of their glass
news that charm to listning ears
that false alarm to hopes and fears
that common theme for every fop
from the statesman to the shop
in those coverts neer be spread
of whos deceasd or whos to wed
be no tidings thither brought
but silent as a midnight thought
where the world may neer invade
be those windings and that shade


courteous fate afford me there
a table spread without my care
with what the neighbring fields impart
whose cleanliness be all its art
when of old the calf was drest
tho to make an angels feast
in the plain unstudied sauce
nor treufle nor morillia was
nor coud the mighty patriarchs board
one farfetchd ortolane afford
courteous fate then give me there
only plain and wholesome fare
fruits indeed woud heaven bestow
all that did in eden grow
all but the forbidden tree
woud be coveted by me
grapes with juice so crouded up
as breaking thro the native cup


figs yet growing candyd oer
by the suns attracting powr
cherries with the downy peach
all within my easie reach
whilst creeping near the humble ground
shoud the strawberry be found
springing wheresoeer i strayd
thro those windings and that shade


for my garments let them be
what may with the time agree
warm when phoebus does retire
and is illsupplyd by fire
but when he renews the year
and verdant all the fields appear
beauty every thing resumes
birds have dropt their winterplumes
when the lilly full displayd
stands in purer white arrayd


than that vest which heretofore
the luxurious a monarch wore
when from salems gates he drove
to the soft retreat of love
lebanons all burnishd house
and the dear egyptian spouse
cloath me fate tho not so gay
cloath me light and fresh as may
in the fountains let me view
all my habit cheap and new
such as when sweet zephyrs fly
with their motions may comply
gently waving to express
unaffected carelessness


no perfumes have there a part
borrowd from the chymists art
but such as rise from flowry beds
or the falling jasmin sheds
twas the odour of the field
esaus rural coat did yield
that inspird his fathers prayr
for blessings of the earth and air
of gums or pouders had it smelt
the supplanter then unfelt


easily had been descryd
for one that did in tents abide
for some beauteous handmaids joy
and his mothers darling boy
let me then no fragrance wear
but what the winds from gardens bear
in such kind surprizing gales
as gatherd from b fidentias vales
all the flowers that in them grew
which intermixing as they flew


in wreathen garlands dropt agen
on lucullus and his men
who cheard by the victorious sight
trebld numbers put to flight
let me when i must be fine
in such natural colours shine
wove and painted by the sun
whose resplendent rays to shun
when they do too fiercely beat
let me find some close retreat
where they have no passage made
thro those windings and that shade


give me there since heaven has shown
it was not good to be alone
a partner suited to my mind
solitary pleasd and kind
who partially may something see
preferrd to all the world in me


slighting by my humble side
fame and splendor wealth and pride
when but two the earth possest
twas their happiest days and best
they by busness nor by wars
they by no domestick cares
from each other eer were drawn
but in some grove or flowry lawn
spent the swiftly flying time
spent their own and natures prime
in love that only passion given
to perfect man whilst friends with heaven
rage and jealousie and hate
transports of his fallen state
when by satans wiles betrayd
fly those windings and that shade


thus from crouds and noise removd
let each moment be improvd


every object still produce
thoughts of pleasure and of use
when some river slides away
to encrease the boundless sea
think we then how time dos haste
to grow eternity at last
by the willows on the banks
gatherd into social ranks
playing with the gentle winds
strait the boughs and smooth the rinds
moist each fibre and each top
wearing a luxurious crop
let the time of youth be shown
the time alas too soon outgrown
whilst a lonely stubborn oak
which no breezes can provoke
no less gusts persuade to move
than those which in a whirlwind drove
spoild the old fraternal feast
and left alive but one poor guest


rivelld the distorted trunk
sapless limbs all bent and shrunk
sadly does the time presage
of our too near approaching age
when a helpless vine is found
unsupported on the ground
careless all the branches spread
subject to each haughty tread
bearing neither leaves nor fruit
living only in the root


back reflecting let me say
so the sad ardelia lay
blasted by a storm of fate
felt thro all the british state
falln neglected lost forgot
dark oblivion all her lot
faded till armindas love
guided by the powrs above
warmd anew her drooping heart
and life diffusd thro every part


mixing words in wise discourse
of such weight and wondrous force
as could all her sorrows charm
and transitory ills disarm
chearing the delightful day
when disposd to be more gay
with wit from an unmeasured store
to woman neer allowd before
what nature or refining art
all that fortune coud impart
heaven did to arminda send
then gave her for ardelias friend


to her cares the cordial drop
which else had overflowd the cup
so when once the son of jess
every anguish did oppress
hunted by all kinds of ills
like a partridge on the hills
trains were laid to catch his life
baited with a royal wife


from his house and country torn
made a heathen princes scorn
fate to answer all these harms
threw a friend into his arms
friendship still has been designd
the support of humankind
the safe delight the useful bliss
the next worlds happiness and this
give then o indulgent fate
give a friend in that retreat
tho withdrawn from all the rest
still a clue to reach my breast
let a friend be still conveyd
thro those windings and that shade


where may i remain secure
waste in humble joys and pure
a life that can no envy yield
want of affluence my shield


thus had crassus been content
when from marius rage he went
with the seat that fortune gave
the commodious ample cave
formd in a divided rock
by some mighty earthquakes shock
into rooms of every size
fair as art coud eer devise
leaving in the marble roof
gainst all storms and tempests proof


only passage for the light
to refresh the chearful sight
whilst three sharers in his fate
on th escape with joy dilate
beds of moss their bodies bore
canopyd with ivy oer
rising springs that round them playd
oer the native pavement strayd


when the hour arrivd to dine
various meats and sprightly wine
on some neighbring cliff they spyd
every day anew supplyd
by a friends entrusted care
had he still continud there
made that lonely wondrous cave
both his palace and his grave
peace and rest he might have found
peace and rest are under ground


nor have been in that retreat
famd for a proverbial fate
in pursuit of wealth been caught
and punishd with a golden draught
nor had d he who crowds coud blind
whispring with a snowy hind
made em think that from above
like the great imposters dove
tydings to his ears she brought
rules by which he marchd and fought


after spain he had oerrun
cities sackd and battles won
drove romes consuls from the field
made her darling pompey yield
at a fatal treacherous feast
felt a dagger in his breast
had he his oncepleasing thought
of solitude to practice brought
had no wild ambition swayd
in those islands had he stayd
justly calld the seats of rest
truly e fortunate and blest


by the ancient poets givn
as their best discoverd heavn
let me then indulgent fate
let me still in my retreat
from all roving thoughts be freed
or aims that may contention breed


nor be my endeavours led
by goods that perish with the dead
fitly might the life of man
be indeed esteemd a span
if the present moment were
of delight his only share
if no other joys he knew
than what round about him grew
but as those who stars woud trace
from a subterranean place


through some engine lift their eyes
to the outward glorious skies
so th immortal spirit may
when descended to our clay
from a rightly governd frame
view the height from whence she came
to her paradise be caught
and things unutterable taught
given me then in that retreat
give me o indulgent fate


for all pleasures left behind
contemplations of the mind
let the fair the gay the vain
courtship and applause obtain
let th ambitious rule the earth
let the giddy fool have mirth


give the epicure his dish
evry one their sevral wish
whilst my transports i employ
on that more extensive joy
when all heaven shall be surveyd
from those windings and that shade


when poets gave their god in crete a birth
then jupiter held traffick with the earth
and had a farm to lett the fine was high
for much the treasry wanted a supply
by danaes wealthy showr exhausted quite and dry


but mercry who as steward kept the court
so rackd the rent that all who made resort
unsatisfyd returnd nor could agree
to use the lands or pay his secret fee
till one poor clown thought subtler than the rest
thro various projects rolling in his breast
consents to take it if at his desire
all weathers towrds his harvest may conspire
the frost to kill the worm the brooding snow
the filling rains may come and phoebus glow


the terms accepted signd and seald the lease
his neighbours grounds afford their due encrease
the care of heavn the owners cares may cease
whilst the new tenant anxious in his mind
now asks a showr now craves a rustling wind
to raise what that had lodgd that he the sheaves may bind
the sun thoershadowing clouds the moistning dews
he with such contrariety does chuse
so often and so oddly shifts the scene
whilst others load he scarce has what to glean


o jupiter with famine pinchd he cries
no more will i direct th unerring skies
no more my substance on a project lay
no more a sullen doubt i will betray
let me but live to reap do thou appoint the way


fortune wellpicturd on a rolling globe
with waving locks and thin transparent robe
a man beholding to his neighbor cryd
whoeer would catch this dame must swiftly ride
mark how she seems to fly and with her bears
all that is worth a busie mortals cares


the gilded air about her statue shines
as if the earth had lent it all her mines


at random here a diadem she flings
and there a scarlet hat with dangling strings
and to ten thousand fools ten thousand glorious things
shall i then stay at home dull and content
with quarterdays and hard extorted rent
no ill to horse to sea to utmost isles
but ill encounter her propitious smiles
whilst you in slothful ease may chuse to sleep
and scarce the few paternal acres keep
farewel replyd his friend may you advance
and grow the darling of this lady chance
whilst i indeed not courting of her grace
shall dwell content in this my native place
hoping i still shall for your friend be known
but if too big for such acquaintance grown


i shant be such a fond mistaken sot
to think remembrance should become my lot
when you exalted have your self forgot
nor me ambitious ever shall you find
or hunting fortune who they say is blind
but if her want of sight shoud make her stray
she shoud be welcome if she came this way
tis very like the undertaker cryd
that she her steps to these lost paths shoud guide
but i lose time whilst i such thoughts deride
away he goes with expectation cheard
but when his course he round the world had steerd
and much had borne and much had hopd and feard
yet coud not be informd where he might find
this fickle mistress of all humankind
he quits at length the chace of flying game
and back as to his neighbors house he came
he there encounters the uncertain dame


who lighting from her gaudy coach in haste
to him her eager speeches thus addrest
fortune behold who has been long pursud
whilst all the men that have my splendors viewd
madly enamourd have such flattries forgd
and with such lies their vain pretensions urgd
that hither i am fled to shun their suits
and by free choice conclude their vain disputes
whilst i the owner of this mansion bless
and he unseeking fortune shall possess
tho rightly chargd as something dark of sight
yet merit when tis found is my delight
to knaves and fools when ive some grace allowd
t has been like scattering money in a croud
to make me sport as i beheld them strive
and some observd thro age but halfalive
scrambling amongst the vigorous and young
one proves his sword and one his wheedling tongue
all striving to obtain me right or wrong


whilst crowns and crosiers in the contest hurld
shewd me a farce in the contending world
thou wert deluded whilst with ship or steed
thou lately didst attempt to reach my speed
and by laborious toil and endless pains
didst sell thy quiet for my doubtful gains
whilst he alone my real favrite rises
who every thing to its just value prizes
and neither courts nor yet my gifts despises


a brazen pot by scouring vext
with beef and pudding still perplext
resolvd t attempt a nobler life
urging the jugg to share the strife


brother quoth he love to endear
why shoud we two continue here
to serve and cook such homely cheer
who tho we move with awkward pace
your stony bowels and my face
abroad cant miss of wealth and place
then let us instantly be going
and see what in the world is doing
the bloated jugg supine and lazy
who made no wish but to be easy
nor like its owner eer did think
of ought but to be filld with drink
yet something movd by this fine story
and frothing higher with vainglory
replyd he never wanted metal
but had not sides like sturdy kettle
that in a croud coud shove and bustle
and to preferment bear the justle
when the first knock would break his measures
and stop his rise to place and treasures


sure quoth the pot thy scull is thicker
than ever was thy muddiest liquor
go i not with thee for thy guard
to take off blows and dangers ward
and hast thou never heard that cully
is borne thro all by daring bully
your self replyd the drinkconveigher
may be my ruin and betrayer
a superiority you boast
and dress the meat i but the toast
than mine your constitutions stronger
and in fatigues can hold out longer
and shoud one bang from you be taken
i into nothing shoud be shaken
a dautre cryd the pot in scorn
dost think theres such a villain born
that when he proffers aid and shelter
will rudely fall to helterskelter
no more but follow to the road
where each now drags his pondrous load


and up the hill were almost clamberd
when may it ever be rememberd
down rolls the jugg and after rattles
the most perfidious of all kettles
at every molehill gives a jump
nor rests till by obdurate thump
the pot of stone to shivers broken
sends each misguided fool a token
to show them by this fatal test
that equal company is best
where none oppress nor are opprest


thus tapistry of old the walls adornd
ere noblest dames the artful shuttle scornd
arachne then with pallas did contest
and scarce th immortal work was judgd the best
nor valorous actions then in books were fought
but all the fame that from the field was brought
employd the loom where the kind consort wrought
whilst sharing in the toil she shard the fame
and with the heroes mixt her interwoven name
no longer females to such praise aspire
and seldom now we rightly do admire


so much all arts are by the men engrossd
and our few talents unimprovd or crossd
even i who on this subject woud compose
which the famd urbin for his pencil chose
and here in tincturd wool we now behold
correctly followd in each shade and fold
shoud prudently from the attempt withdraw
but inclination proves the stronger law
and tho the censures of the world pursue
these hardy flights whilst his designs i view
my burdend thoughts which labour for a vent
urge me texplain in verse what by each face is meant


of sergius first upon his lofty seat
with due regard our observations treat
who whilst he thence on elymas looks down
contracts his pensive brow into a frown
with looks inquistive he seeks the cause
why nature acts not still by natures laws


twas but a moment since the sorcerers sight
receivd the day and blazd infernal light
untouchd the optiques in a moment faild
their fierce illumination quenchd or veild
throughout th extention of his ample sway
no fact like this the roman coud survey
who with spread hands invites mankind to gaze
and sympathize in the profound amaze
to share his wonder every one combines
by diffrent aspects shewn and diffrent signs
a comely figure near the consul placd
with serious mildness and instruction gracd
to others seems imparting what he saw
and shews the wretch with reverential awe
whilst a more eager person next we find
viewing the wizard with a skeptics mind
who his fixt eyes so near him dos apply
we think enlivning beams might from them fly


to reinkindle by so just an aim
the radial sparks but lately checkd and tame
as tapers new putout will catch approaching flame
but dire surprize th enquiry dos succeed
whilst full conviction in his face we read
and he who questiond now deplores the deed


to sacred paul a younger figure guides
with seeming warmth which still in youth presides
and pointing forward elder men directs
in him to note the cause of these effects
upon whose brow dos evidently shine
deputed powr t inflict the wrath divine
whilst sad and solemn suited to their years
each venerable countenance appears
where yet we see astonishment reveald
tho by the aged often tis conceald


who the emotions of their souls disguize
lest by admiring they shoud seem less wise


but to thy portrait elymas we come
whose blindness almost strikes the poet dumb
and whilst she vainly to describe thee seeks
the pen but traces where the pencil speaks
of darkness to be felt our scriptures write
thou darkend seemst as thou wouldst feel the light
and with projected limbs betrayst a dread
of unseen mischiefs levelld at thy head
thro all thy frame such stupefaction reigns
as night it self were sunk into thy veins
nor by the eyes alone thy loss we find
each lineament helps to proclaim thee blind
an artful dimness far diffusd we grant
and failing seem all parts through one important want


oh mighty raphael justly sure renownd
since in thy works such excellence is found
no wonder if with nature thourt at strife
who thus can paint the negatives of life
and deprivation more expressive make
than the most perfect draughts which others take
whilst to this chiefest figure of the piece
all that surround it heightnings do encrease
in some amazement by extreams is shewn
who viewing his closd lids extend their own
nor can by that enough their thoughts express
which opning months seem ready to confess


thus stand the lictors gazing on a deed
which dos all humane chastisements exceed
enfeebld seem their instruments of smart
when keener words can swifter ills impart


thou barnabas though last not least our care
seemst equally employd in praise and prayer


acknowledging th omnipotent decree
yet soft compassion in thy face we see
whilst lifted hands implore a kind relief
tho no impatience animates thy grief
but mild suspence and charity benign
do all th excesses of thy looks confine


thus far our slow imagination goes
woud the more skilld theanor his disclose
expand the scene and open to our sight
what to his nicer judgement gives delight
whose soaring mind dos to perfections climb
nor owns a relish but for things sublime
then woud the piece fresh beauties still present
nor length of time woud leave the eye content
as moments hours as hours the days woud seem
observing here taught to observe by him


now spent the alterd king in amrous cares
the hours of sacred hymns and solemn prayrs
in vain the alter waits his slow returns
where unattended incense faintly burns
in vain the whispring priests their fears express
and of the change a thousand causes guess
heedless of all their censures he retires
and in his palace feeds his secret fires
impatient till from rabbah tydings tell
that near those walls the poor uriah fell
led to the onset by a chosen few
who at the treacherous signal soon withdrew
nor to his rescue eer returnd again
till by fierce ammons sword they saw the victim slain
tis passd tis done the holy marriageknot
too strong to be untyd at last is cut


and now to bathsheba the king declares
that with his heart the kingdom too is hers
that israels throne and longing monarchs arms
are to be filld but with her widowd charms
nor must the days of formal tears exceed
to cross the living and abuse the dead


this she denies and signs of grief are worn
but mourns no more than may her face adorn
give to those eyes which love and empire fird
a melting softness more to be desird
till the fixt time tho hard to be endurd
was passd and a sad consorts name procurd


when with the pomp that suits a princes thought
by passion swayd and glorious woman taught
a queen shes made than michal seated higher
whilst light unusual airs prophane the hallowd lyre


where art thou nathan wheres that spirit now
givn to brave vice tho on a princes brow
in what low cave or on what desert coast
now virtue wants it is thy presence lost


but lo he comes the revrend bard appears
defild with dust his awful silver hairs
and his rough garment wet with falling tears
the king this markd and conscious woud have fled
the healing balm which for his wounds was shed
till the more wary priest the serpents art
joind to the dovelike temper of his heart
and thus retards the prince just ready now to part


hear me the cause betwixt two neighbors hear
thou who for justice dost the sceptre bear
help the opprest nor let me weep alone
for him that calls for succour from the throne
good princes for protection are adord
and greater by the shield than by the sword
this clears the doubt and now no more he fears
the cause his own and therefore stays and hears
when thus the prophet in a flowry plain
a kinglike man does in full plenty reign


casts round his eyes in vain to reach the bound
which jordans flood sets to his fertile ground
countless his flocks whilst lebanon contains
a herd as large kept by his numerous swains
that fill with morning bellowings the cool air
and to the cedars shade at scorching noon repair
near to this wood a lowly cottage stands
built by the humble owners painful hands


fencd by a stubbleroof from rain and heat
securd without within all plain and neat
a field of small extent surrounds the place
in which one single ewe did sport and graze
this his whole stock till in full time there came
to bless his utmost hopes a snowy lamb


which lest the season yet too cold might prove
and northern blasts annoy it from the grove
or towring fowl on the weak prey might sieze
for with his store his fears must too increase
he brings it home and lays it by his side
at once his wealth his pleasure and his pride
still bars the door by labour calld away
and when returning at the close of day


with one small mess himself and that sustains
and half his dish it shares and half his slender gains
when to the great mans table now there comes
a lord as great followd by hungry grooms


for these must be provided sundry meats
the best for some for others coarser cates
one servant diligent above the rest
to help his master to contrive the feast
extols the lamb was nourished with such care
so fed so lodgd it must be princely fare
and having this my lord his own may spare


in haste he sends led by no law but will
not to entreat or purchase but to kill
the messengers arrivd the harmless spoil
unusd to fly runs bleating to the toil
whilst for the innocent the owner feard
and sure woud move coud poverty be heard
oh spare he cries the product of my cares
my stocks encrease the blessing on my prayrs


my growing hope and treasure of my life
more was he speaking when the murdring knife
shewd him his suit tho just must be denyd
and the white fleece in its own scarlet dyd
whilst the poor helpless wretch stands weeping by
and lifts his hands for justice to the sky


which he shall find th incensed king replies
when for the proud offence th oppressor dies
o nathan by the holy name i swear
our land such wrongs unpunished shall not bear
if with the fault th offender thou declare


to whom the prophet closing with the time
thou art the man replies and thine th illnaturd crime
nor think against thy place or state i err
a powr above thee does this charge prefer
urgd by whose spirit hither am i brought
t expostulate his goodness and thy fault


to lead thee back to those forgotten years
in labour spent and lowly rustick cares
when in the wilderness thy flocks but few
thou didst the shepherds simple art pursue
thro crusting frosts and penetrating dew


till wondring jesse saw six brothers past
and thou elected thou the least and last
a sceptre to thy rural hand conveyd
and in thy bosom royal beauties laid
a lovely princess made thy prize that day
when on the shaken ground the giant lay
stupid in death beyond the reach of cries
that bore thy shouted fame to listning skies
and drove the flying foe as fast away
as winds of old locusts to egypts sea


thy heart with love thy temples with renown
th allgiving hand of heavn did largely crown
whilst yet thy cheek was spread with youthful down
what more coud craving man of god implore
or what for favourd man coud god do more
yet coud not these nor israels throne suffice
intemprate wishes drawn thro wandring eyes


one beauty not thy own and seen by chance
melts down the work of grace with an alluring glance
chafes the spirit fed by sacred art
and blots the title after gods own heart
black murder breeds to level at his head
who boasts so fair a partner of his bed
nor longer must possess those envyd charms
the single treasure of his house and arms
giving by this thy fall cause to blaspheme
to all the heathen the almighty name
for which the sword shall still thy race pursue
and in revolted israels scornful view


thy captivd wives shall be in triumph led
unto a bold usurpers shameful bed
who from thy bowels sprung shall seize thy throne
and scourge thee by a sin beyond thy own


thou hast thy fault in secret darkness done
but this the world shall see before the noondays sun


enough the king enough the saint replies
and pours his swift repentance from his eyes
falls on the ground and tears the nuptial vest
by which his crimes completion was exprest
then with a sigh blasting to carnal love
drawn deep as hell and piercing heaven above
let me he cries let me attend his rod
for i have sinnd for i have lost my god


hold says the prophet of that speech beware
god neer was lost unless by mans despair
the wound that is thus willingly reveald
th almighty is as willing should be heald
thus washd in tears thy soul as fair does show
as the first fleece which on the lamb does grow
or on the mountains top the lately fallen snow


yet to the world that justice may appear
acting her part impartial and severe
the offspring of thy sin shall soon resign
that life for which thou must not once repine
but with submissive grief his fate deplore
and bless the hand that does inflict no more


shall i then pay but part and owe the whole
my bodys fruit for my offending soul
shall i no more endure the king demands
and scape thus lightly his offended hands
oh let him all resume my crown my fame
reduce me to the nothing whence i came
call back his favours faster than he gave
and if but pardond strip me to my grave
since tho he seems to lose he surely wins
who gives but earthly comforts for his sins


why to our wonder in this place is seen
thus discomposd and alterd judas queen
may we demand what terrors seize your breast
or why your steps are to this house addrest
where your unguarded person stands exposd
to secret foes within its walls inclosd
can it be thought that you remit that hate
no more but both observe what i relate
not that i mean recalling times of blood
to make you judges of the paths i trod
when to the emptyd throne i boldly rose
treating all intercepters as my foes


twas heavns decree that i should thus succeed
whose following favour justifies the deed
extending my unlimited command
from sea to sea oer the obedient land
whilst your jerusalem all peace enjoys
nor now the encroaching philistine destroys
nor wandring arab his pavilion spreads
near jordans banks nor wastes his flowry meads
the great assyrian terror of your kings
who bought his friendship with their holiest things
yields that a sister of his powrful race
should sway these realms and dignify the place
nor need we add the late insulting foe
the furious jehu does this sceptre know
and sinks beneath the load of conscious fears
when in samaria he my actions hears
distrest by foes which ive against him raisd
he sees me unmolested fixd and pleasd


at least till now thus glorious was my state
but somethings threatned from relaxing fate
and the last night which should have brought me rest
has all these great ideas dispossest
a dream a vision an apparent view
of what methinks does still my steps pursue
hangs on my pensive heart and bears it down
more than the weight of an objected crown
my mother be the name with revrence spoke
ere chearful day thro horrid shades had broke


approachd my bed magnificent her dress
her shape her air did jesabel confess
nor seemd her face to have refusd that art
which in despight of age does youth impart
and which she practisd scorning to decay
or to be vanquishd evn in natures way
thus all arrayd in such defying pride
as when th injurious conquror she descryd
and did in height of powr for illgot powr deride


to me she spake these accents to me came
thou worthy daughter of my soaring fame
tho with a more transcendent spirit filld
tho struggling powrs attempt thy life to shield
the hebrews god oh tremble at the sound
shall thee and them and all their rights confound
a pitying groan concludes no word of aid
my arms i thought to throw about the shade
of that lovd parent but my troubled sight
no more directed them to aim aright
nor ought presented but a heap of bones
for which fierce dogs contended on the stones
with flakes of mangled flesh that quivring still
proclaimd the freshness of the sufferd ill
distaind with blood the pavement and the wall
appeard as in that memorable fall


oh just avenging heaven
sure dreams like these are for prevention given


what art thou spleen which evry thing dost ape
thou proteus to abusd mankind
who never yet thy real cause coud find
or fix thee to remain in one continued shape
still varying thy perplexing form
now a dead sea thoult represent
a calm of stupid discontent
then dashing on the rocks wilt rage into a storm
trembling sometimes thou dost appear
dissolvd into a panick fear
on sleep intruding dost thy shadows spread
thy gloomy terrours round the silent bed
and croud with boading dreams the melancholy head
or when the midnight hour is told
and drooping lids thou still dost waking hold


thy fond delusions cheat the eyes
before them antick spectres dance
unusual fires their pointed heads advance
and airy phantoms rise
such was the monstrous vision seen
when brutus now beneath his cares opprest
and all romes fortunes rolling in his breast
before philippis latest field
before his fate did to octavius lead
was vanquishd by the spleen


falsly the mortal part we blame
of our deprest and pondrous frame
which till the first degrading sin
let thee its dull attendant in
still with the other did comply
nor cloggd the active soul disposd to fly
and range the mansions of its native sky


nor whilst in his own heaven he dwelt
whilst man his paradice possest
his fertile garden in the fragrant east
and all united odours smelt
no armed sweets until thy reign
coud shock the sense or in the face
a flusht unhandsom colour place
now the jonquille oercomes the feeble brain
we faint beneath the aromatick pain a
till some offensive scent thy powrs appease
and pleasure we resign for short and nauseous ease


in evry one thou dost possess
new are thy motions and thy dress
now in some grove a listning friend
thy false suggestions must attend
thy whisperd griefs thy fancyd sorrows hear
breathd in a sigh and witnessd by a tear


whilst in the light and vulgar croud
thy slaves more clamorous and loud
by laughters unprovokd thy influence too confess
in the imperious wife thou vapours art
which from oerheated passions rise
in clouds to the attractive brain
until descending thence again
thro the oercast and showring eyes
upon her husbands softend heart


he the disputed point must yield
something resign of the contested field
til lordly man born to imperial sway
compounds for peace to make that right away
and woman armd with spleen dos servilely obey


the fool to imitate the wits
complains of thy pretended fits
and dulness born with him woud lay
upon thy accidental sway


because sometimes thou dost presume
into the ablest heads to come
that often men of thoughts refind
impatient of unequal sence
such slow returns where they so much dispense
retiring from the croud are to thy shades inclind
oer me alas thou dost too much prevail
i feel thy force whilst i against thee rail
i feel my verse decay and my crampt numbers fail
thro thy black jaundice i all objects see
as dark and terrible as thee
my lines decryd and my employment thought
an useless folly or presumptuous fault
whilst in the muses paths i stray
whilst in their groves and by their secret springs
my hand delights to trace unusual things
and deviates from the known and common way
nor will in fading silks compose
faintly th inimitable rose


fill up an illdrawn bird or paint on glass
the sovreigns blurrd and undistinguishd face
the threatning angel and the speaking ass


patron thou art to evry gross abuse
the sullen husbands feignd excuse
when the ill humour with his wife he spends
and bears recruited wit and spirits to his friends
the son of bacchus pleads thy powr
as to the glass he still repairs
pretends but to remove thy cares
snatch from thy shades one gay and smiling hour
and drown thy kingdom in a purple showr
when the coquette whom evry fool admires


woud in variety be fair
and changing hastily the scene
from light impertinent and vain
assumes a soft a melancholy air


and of her eyes rebates the wandring fires
the careless posture and the head reclind
the thoughtful and composed face
proclaiming the withdrawn the absent mind
allows the fop more liberty to gaze
who gently for the tender cause inquires


the cause indeed is a defect in sense
yet is the spleen allegd and still the dull pretence
but these are thy fantastic harms
the tricks of thy pernicious stage
which do the weaker sort engage
worse are the dire effects of thy more powrful charms
by thee religion all we know
that shoud enlighten here below
is veild in darkness and perplext
with anxious doubts with endless scruples vext
and some restraint implyd from each perverted text


whilst touch not taste not what is freely givn
is but thy niggard voice disgracing bounteous heavn
from speech restraind by thy deceits abusd
to desarts banishd or in cells reclusd
mistaken votries to the powrs divine
whilst they a purer sacrifice design
do but the spleen obey and worship at thy shrine


in vain to chase thee evry art we try
in vain all remedies apply
in vain the indian leaf infuse
or the parchd eastern berry bruise
some pass in vain those bounds and nobler liquors use
now harmony in vain we bring
inspire the flute and touch the string
from harmony no help is had
musick but soothes thee if too sweetly sad
and if too light but turns thee gayly mad


tho the physicians greatest gains
altho his growing wealth he sees
daily increasd by ladies fees
yet dost thou baffle all his studious pains
not skilful lower thy source coud find
or thro the welldissected body trace
the secret the mysterious ways
by which thou dost surprize and prey upon the mind
tho in the search too deep for humane thought
with unsuccessful toil he wrought
til thinking thee tove catchd himself by thee was caught
retaind thy prisner thy acknowlegd slave
and sunk beneath thy chain to a lamented grave


with such a pulse with such disorderd veins
such labring breath as thy disease constrains
with failing eyes that scarce the light endure
so long unclosd theyve watchd thy doubtful cure
to his hephæstion alexander writes
to soothe thy days and wing thy sleepless nights
i send thee love oh that i could impart
as well my vital spirits to thy heart
that when the fierce distemper thine woud quell
they might renew the fight and the cold foe repel
as on arbelas plains we turnd the day
when persians through our troops had mowd their way
when the rough scythians on the plunder run
and barbrous shouts proclaimd the conquest won
till oer my head to stop the swift despair
the bird of jove fans the supporting air
above my plume does his broad wings display
and follows wheresoeer i force my way
whilst aristander in his robe of white
shews to the wavring host th auspicious sight
new courage it inspires in evry breast
and wins at once the empire of the east
coud he but now some kind presage afford
that health might be again to thee restord
thou to my wishes to my fond embrace
thy looks the same the same majestick grace
that round thee shone when we together went
to chear the royal captives in their tent
where sysigambis prostrate on the floor
did alexander in thy form adore
above great æsculapius shoud he stand
or made immortal by apelles hand
but no reviving hope his art allows
and such cold damps invade my anxious brows


as when in cydnus plungd i dard the flood
t oermatch the boilings of my youthful blood
but philip to my aid repaird in haste
and whilst the profferd draught i boldly taste
as boldly he the dangerous paper views
which of hid treasons does his fame accuse
more thy physicians life on thine depends
and what he gives his own preserves or ends
if thou expirst beneath his fruitless care
to rhadamanthus shall the wretch repair
and give strict answer for his errors there


near thy pavilion listning princes wait
seeking from thine to learn their monarchs state
submitting kings that post from day to day
to keep those crowns which at my feet they lay
forget th ambitious subject of their speed
and here arrivd only thy dangers heed
the beauties of the clime now thourt away
droop and retire as if their god of day


no more upon their early prayrs would shine
or take their incense at his late decline
thy parisatis whom i fear to name
lest to thy heat it add redoubld flame
thy lovely wife thy parisatis weeps
and in her grief a solemn silence keeps
stretchd in her tent upon the floor she lies
so pale her looks so motionless her eyes
as when they gave thee leave at first to gaze
upon the charms of her unguarded face
when the beauteous sisters lowly knelt
and sud to those who more than pity felt
to chear her now statira vainly proves
and at thy name alone she sighs and moves


but why these single griefs shoud i expose
the world no mirth no war no busness knows
but hushd with sorrow stands to favour thy repose


evn i my boasted title now resign
not ammons son nor born of race divine
but mortal all oppressd with restless fears
wild with my cares and womanish in tears
tho tears before i for lost clytus shed
and wept more drops than the old hero bled
evn now methinks i see him on the ground
now my dire arms the wretched corpse surround
now the fled soul i wooe now rave upon the wound


yet he for whom this mighty grief did spring
not alexander valud but the king
then think how much that passion must transcend
which not a subject raises but a friend
an equal partner in the vanquished earth
a brother not imposd upon my birth
too weak a tye unequal thoughts to bind
but by the genrous motions of the mind


my love to thee for empire was the test
since him who from mankind coud chuse the best
the gods thought only fit for monarch oer the rest
live then my friend but if that must not be
nor fate will with my boundless mind agree
affording at one time the world and thee
to the most worthy ill that sway resign
and in elysium keep hyphæstion mine


cupid one day askd his mother
when she meant that he shoud wed
youre too young my boy she said
nor has nature made another
fit to match with cupids bed


cupid then her sight directed
to a lately wedded pair
where himself the match effected
they as youthful they as fair


having by example carryd
this first point in the dispute
worseley next he saids not marryd
hers with cupids charms may suit


on the banks of the severn a desperate maid
whom some shepherd neglecting his vows had betrayd
stood resolving to banish all sense of the pain
and pursue thro her death a revenge on the swain
since the gods and my passion at once he defies
since his vanity lives whilst my character dies


no more did she say will i trifle with fate
but commit to the waves both my love and my hate
and now to comply with that furious desire
just ready to plunge and alone to expire
some reflection on death and its terrors untryd
some scorn for the shepherd some flashings of pride
at length pulld her back and she cryd why this strife
since the swains are so many and ive but one life


why was that baleful creature made
which seeks our quiet to invade
and screams ill omens through the shade


twas sure for every mortals good
when by wrong painting of her brood
she doomd them for the eagles food


who profferd safety to her tribe
woud she but shew them or describe
and serving him his favour bribe


when thus she did his highness tell
in looks my young do all excel
nor nightingales can sing so well


youd joy to see the pretty souls
with wadling steps and frowzy poles
come creeping from their secret holes


but i neer let them take the air
the fortunehunters do so stare
and heiresses indeed they are


this ancient yew three hundred years
has been possessd by lineal heirs
the males extinct now all is theirs


i hope ive done their beauties right
whose eyes outshine the stars by night
their muffs and tippets too are white


the king of cedars wavd his power
and swore hed fast evn from that hour
ere hed such lady birds devour


th agreement seald on either part
the owl now promisd from her heart
all his nightdangers to divert


as centinel to stand and whoop
if single fowl or shoal or troop
should at his palace aim or stoop


but home one evening without meat
the eagle comes and takes his seat
where they did these conditions treat


the motherowl was prold away
to seek abroad for needful prey
and forth the misses came to play


whats here the hungry monarch cryd
when near him living flesh he spyd
with which he hopd to be supplyd


but recollecting twas the place
where hed so lately promisd grace
to an enchanting beauteous race


he pausd a while and kept his maw
with sober temperance in awe
till all their lineaments he saw


what are these things and of what sex
at length he cryd with vulturs becks
and shoulders higher than their necks


these wear no palatines nor muffs
italian silks or doyley stuffs
but motley callicoes and ruffs


nor brightness in their eyes is seen
but through the film a dusky green
and like old margery is their mien


then for my supper theyre designd
nor can be of that lovely kind
to whom my pity was inclind


no more delays as soon as spoke
the plumes are stripped the grisles broke
and near the feeder was to choak


when now returnd the grizly dame
whose family was out of frame
against leaguebreakers does exclaim


how quoth the lord of soaring fowls
whilst horribly she wails and howls
were then your progeny but owls


i thought some phoenix was their sire
who did those charming looks inspire
that youd prepard me to admire


upon your self the blame be laid
my talons youve to blood betrayd
and lyd in every word you said


faces or books beyond their worth extolld
are censurd most and thus to pieces pulled


a fond athenian mother brought
a sculptor to indulge her thought
and carve her only son
who to such strange perfection wrought
that every eye the statue caught
nor ought was left undone


a youthful smile adornd the face
the polish gave that smile a grace
and through the marble reigns
which well the artists skill coud trace
and in their due positions place
a thread of purple veins


the parasites about it came
whose praises were too large to name
and to each other said
the man so well had reachd his aim
th original coud oer it claim
only a native red


mean while a sage amidst the croud
thus with a precept wise and loud
checkd the vainglorious boy
by telling him who now grew proud
that tho with beauty twas endowd
the figure was a toy


of no advantage to the state
twoud neither combate nor debate
but idly stand alone
bids him beware whilst men create
in stone thus his resemblance great
he proves not like the stone


the hog the sheep and goat carrying to a fair
who does not wish ever to judge aright
and in the course of lifes affairs
to have a quick and far extended sight


tho it too often multiplies his cares
and who has greater sense but greater sorrow shares


this felt the swine now carrying to the knife
and whilst the lamb and silent goat
in the same fatal cart lay void of strife
he widely stretches his foreboding throat
deafning the easy crew with his outragious note


the angry driver chides thunruly beast
and bids him all this noise forbear
nor be more loud nor clamorous than the rest
who with him traveld to the neighbring fair
and quickly shoud arrive and be unfetterd there


this quoth the swine i do believe is true
and see were very near the town
whilst these poor fools of short and bounded view
think twill be well when you have set them down
and easd one of her milk the other of her gown


but all the dreadful butchers in a row
to my farsearching thoughts appear
who know indeed we to the shambles go
whilst i whom none but belzebub woud shear
nor but his dam woud milk must for my carcase fear


but tell me then will it prevent thy fate
the rude unpitying farmer cries
if not the wretch who tastes his suffrings late
not he who thro thunhappy future prys
must of the two be held most fortunate and wise


soothing his passions with a warbling sound
a shepherdswain lay stretchd upon the ground
whilst all were movd who their attention lent
or with the harmony in chorus went
to something less than joy yet more than dull content
between which two extreams true pleasure lies
oerrun by fools unreachdat by the wise
but yet a fatal prospect to the sea
woud often draw his greedy sight away
he saw the barques unlading on the shore
and guessd their wealth then scornd his little store
then woud that little lose or else woud make it more
to merchandize converted is the fold
the bag the bottle and the hurdles sold
the dog was changd away the pretty skell
whom he had fed and taught and lovd so well


in vain the phillis wept which heretofore
receivd his presents and his garlands wore
false and upbraided he forsakes the downs
nor courts her smiles nor fears the oceans frowns
for smooth it lay as if one single wave
made all the sea nor winds that sea coud heave
which blew no more than might his sails supply
clear was the air below and phoebus laughd on high
with this adventrer evry thing combines
and gold to gold his happy voyage joins
but not so prosprous was the next essay
for rugged blasts encounterd on the way
scarce coud the men escape the deep had all their prey


our broken merchant in the wreck was thrown
upon those lands which once had been his own
where other flocks now pasturd on the grass
and other corydons had wood his lass
a servant for small profits there he turns
yet thrives again and less and less he mourns


repurchases in time thabandond sheep
which sad experience taught him now to keep
when from that very bank one halcyon day
on which he leand when tempted to the sea
he notes a calm the winds and waves were still
and promisd what the winds nor waves fulfill
a settld quiet and conveyance sure
to him that wealth by traffick woud procure


but the rough part the shepherd now performs
reviles the cheat and at the flattry storms
evn thus quoth he you seemd all rest and ease
you sleeping tempests you untroubld seas
that neer to be forgot that luckless hour
in which i put my fortunes in your powr
quitting my slender but secure estate
my undisturbd repose my sweet retreat
for treasures which you ravishd in a day
but swept my folly with my goods away
then smile no more nor these false shews employ
thou momentary calm thou fleeting joy


no more on me shall these fair signs prevail
some other novice may be won to sail
give me a certain fate in the obscurest vale


to view his stately walks and groves
a man of powr and place
was hastning on but as he roves
his foe the slighted bramble proves
and stops his eager pace


that shrub was qualifyd to bite
and now there went a tale
that this injurious partial wight
had bid his gardner rid it quite
and throw it oer the pail


often the bryr had wishd to speak
that this might not be done
but from the abject and the weak
who no important figure make
what statesman does not run


but clinging now about his waste
ere he had time to fly
my lord quoth he for all your haste
ill know why i must be displacd
and mongst the rubbish lie


must none but buffleheaded trees
within your ground be seen
or tapring yews here court the breeze
that like some beaux whom time does freeze
at once look old and green


i snarl tis true and sometimes scratch
a tenderfooted squire
who does a rugged tartar catch
when me he thinks to overmatch
and jeers for my attire


as to yourself who gainst me fret
een give this project oer
for know whereer my root is set
these rambling twigs will passage get
and vex you more and more


no wants no threatnings nor the jail
will curb an angry wit
then think not to chastise or rail
appease the man if youd prevail
who some sharp satire writ


silvia lets from the croud retire
for what to you and me
who but each other do desire
is all that here we see


apart well live tho not alone
for who alone can call
those who in desarts live with one
if in that one theyve all


the world a vast meander is
where hearts confusdly stray
where few do hit whilst thousands miss
the happy mutual way


where hands are by stern parents tyd
who oft in cupids scorn
do for the widowd state provide
before that love is born


where some too soon themselves misplace
then in another find
the only temper wit or face
that coud affect their mind


others but oh avert that fate
a wellchose object change
fly silvia fly ere tis too late
falln natures prone to range


and tho in heat of love we swear
more than perform we can
no goddess you but woman are
and i no more than man


th impatient silvia heard thus long
then with a smile replyd
those bands coud neer be very strong
which accidents divide


who eer was movd yet to go down
by such oercautious fear
or for one lover left the town
who might have numbers here


your heart tis true is worth them all
and still preferrd the first
but since confessd so apt to fall
tis good to fear the worst


in ancient history we meet
a flying nymph betrayd
who had she kept in fruitful crete
new conquest might have made


and sure as on the beach she stood
to view the parting sails
she cursd her self more than the flood
or the conspiring gales


false theseus since thy vows are broke
may following nymphs beware
methinks i hear how thus she spoke
and will not trust too far


in love in play in trade in war
they best themselves acquit
who tho their intrests shipwreckt are
keep unreprovd their wit


o king of terrors whose unbounded sway
all that have life must certainly obey
the king the priest the prophet all are thine
nor woud evn god in flesh thy stroke decline
my name is on thy roll and sure i must
encrease thy gloomy kingdom in the dust
my soul at this no apprehension feels
but trembles at thy swords thy racks thy wheels
thy scorching fevers which distract the sense
and snatch us raving unprepard from hence
at thy contagious darts that wound the heads
of weeping friends who wait at dying beds
spare these and let thy time be when it will
my busness is to dye and thine to kill
gently thy fatal sceptre on me lay
and take to thy cold arms insensibly thy prey


coud our first father at his toilsome plough
thorns in his path and labour on his brow
cloathd only in a rude unpolishd skin
coud he a vain fantastick nymph have seen
in all her airs in all her antick graces
her various fashions and more various faces
how had it posd that skill which late assignd
just appellations to each several kind
a right idea of the sight to frame
thave guest from what new element she came
thave hit the wavring form or givn this thing a name


for socrates a house was built
of but inferiour size
not highly archd nor carvd nor gilt
the man tis said was wise


but mob despisd the little cell
that struck them with no fear
whilst others thought there should not dwell
so great a person there


how shoud a due recourse be made
to one so much admird
where shoud the spacious cloth be laid
or where the guests retird


believe me quoth the listning sage
twas not to save the charge
that in this overbuilding age
my house was not more large


but this for faithful friends and kind
was only meant by me
who fear that what too streight you find
must yet contracted be


since the road of lifes so ill
i to pass it use this skill
my frail carriage driving home
to its latest stage the tomb
justice first in harness strong
marches stedfastly along
charity to smooth the pace
fills the next adjoining trace
independance leads the way
whom no heavy curb dos sway


truth an equal part sustains
all indulgd the loosend reins
in the box fits vigrous health
shunning miry paths of wealth
gaiety with easy smiles
evry harsher step beguiles
whilst of nature or of fate
only this i woud intreat
the equipage might not decay
till the worn carriage drops away


no cautions of a matron old and sage
young rattlehead to prudence coud engage
but forth the offspring of her bed woud go
nor reason gave but that he woud do so
much counsel was at parting thrown away
evn all that motherrat to son coud say


who followd him with utmost reach of sight
then lost in tears and in abandond plight
turnd to her mournful cell and bid the world goodnight
but fortune kinder than her boding thought
in little time the vagrant homewards brought
raisd in his mind and mended in his dress
who the belair did every way confess
had learnt to flowr his wigg nor brusht away
the falling meal that on his shoulders lay


and from a nutshell wimbld by a worm
took snuff and coud the government reform
the mother weeping from maternal love
to see him thus prodigiously improve


expected mighty changes too within
and wisdom to avoid the cat and gin
whom did you chiefly note sweetheart quoth she
of all the strangers you abroad did see
who gracd you most or did your fancy take
the younger rat than cursd a noisy rake
that barrd the best acquaintance he coud make


and feard him so he trembld evry part
nor to describe him scarce coud have the heart
high on his feet quoth he himself he bore
and terribly in his own language swore
a featherd arm came out from either side
which loud he clappd and combatants defyd
and to each leg a bayonette was tyd
and certainly his head with wounds was sore
for that and both his cheeks a sanguine colour wore
near him there lay the creature i admird
and for a friend by sympathy desird


his make like ours as far as tail and feet
with coat of furr in parallel do meet
yet seeming of a more exalted race
tho humble meekness beautifyd his face
a purring sound composd his gentle mind
whilst frequent slumbers did his eyelids bind
whose soft contracted paw lay calmly still
as if unusd to prejudice or kill


i pausd a while to meditate a speech
and now was stepping just within his reach
when that rude clown began his hectring cry
and made me for my life and from th attempt to fly
indeed twas time the shivring beldam said
to scour the plain and be of life afraid
thou base degenrate seed of injurd rats
thou veriest fool she cryd of all my brats
wouldst thou have shaken hands with hostile cats
and dost not yet thine own and countrys foe
at this expence of time and travel know
alas that swearing staring bullying thing
that tore his throat and blustered with his wing
was but some paltry dunghill craven cock
who serves the early household for a clock
and we his oats and barley often steal
nor fear he shoud revenge the pilferd meal
whilst that demure and seeming harmless puss
herself and mewing chits regales with us


if then of useful sense thoust gaind no more
than ere thoudst past the threshold of my door
be here my son content to dress and dine
steeping the list of beauties in thy wine
and neighbring vermin with false gloss outshine


amongst mankind a thousand fops we see
who in their rambles learn no more than thee
cross oer the alpes and make the tour of france
to learn a paltry song or antick dance
bringing their noddles and valizes packd
with mysteries from shops and taylors wreckd
but what may prejudice their native land
whose troops are raising or whose fleet is mannd
neer moves their thoughts nor do they understand
thou my dear rattlehead and such as these
might keep at home and brood on sloth and ease


whilst others more adapted to the age
may vigrously in warlike feats engage
and live on foreign spoils or dying thin the stage


strephon whose person evry grace
was careful to adorn
thought by the beauties of his face
in silvias love to find a place
and wonderd at her scorn


with bows and smiles he did his part
but oh twas all in vain
a youth less fine a youth of art
had talkd himself into her heart
and woud not out again


strephon with change of habits pressd
and urgd her to admire
his love alone the other dressd
as verse or prose became it best
and movd her soft desire


this found his courtship strephon ends
or makes it to his glass
there in himself now seeks amends
convincd that where a wit pretends
a beau is but an ass


a greedy heir long waited to fulfill
as his executor a kinsmans will
and to himself his age repeated oer
to his infirmities still adding more
and nicely kept th account of the expected store


when death at last to either gave release
making ones pains the others longings cease
who to the grave must decently convey
ere he possession takes the kindred clay
which in a coach was placd wherein he rides
and so no hearse or following train provides
rejecting russel who woud make the charge
of one dull tedious day so vastly large
when at his death the humble man declard
he wished thus privately to be interrd
and now the luggage moves in solemn state
and what it wants in number gains in weight


the happy heir can scarce contain his joy
whilst sundry musings do his thoughts employ
how he shalt act now every things his own
where his revenge or favour shall be shown
then recollecting draws a counterfeited groan
the avenues and gardens shall be changd
already he the furniture has ranged


to ransack secret drawrs his phancy flies
nor can th appearing wealth his mind suffice
thus he an age runs oer betwixt the porch
of his friends house and the adjacent church
whilst the slow driver who no reckning kept
of what was left indulging nature slept
till on a bank so high the wheel was borne
that in a moment all must overturn
whilst the rich heir now finds the giving dead
less weighty in his gold than in his lead
which falling just on his contriving breast
expelld the soul leaving the corpse to rest
in the same grave intended for his friend
then why shoud we our days in wishes spend
which eer we see fulfilld are often at an end


cupid ere deprivd of sight
young and apt for all delight
met with folly on the way
as idle and as fond of play
in gay sports the time they pass
now run now wrestle on the grass
their painted wings then nimbly ply
and evry way for mastry try
till a contest dos arise
who has won th appointed prize
gentle love refers the case
to the next that comes in place
trusting to his flattring wiles
and softens the dispute with smiles
but folly who no temper knows
words pursues with hotter blows
till the eyes of love were lost
which has such pain to mortals cost


venus hears his mournful crys
and repeats em in the skys
to jupiter in council set
with peers for the occasion met
in her arms the boy she bears
bathing him in falling tears
and whilst his want of eyes is shown
secures the judges by her own
folly to the board must come
and hear the tryal and the doom
which cytherea loudly prays
may be as heavy as the case
which when all was justly weighd
cupids wings now useless made
that a staff his feet must guide
which woud still be apt to slide
this decree at last was read
that love by folly shoud be lead


a quack to no true skill in physick bred
with frequent visits cursed his patients bed
enquiring how he did his broths digest
how chimd his pulse and how he took his rest
if shuddring cold by burnings was pursud
and at what time the aguish fit renewd
the waining wretch each day become more faint
in like proportion doubles his complaint


now swooning sweats he begs him to allay
now give his lungs more liberty to play
and take from emptyd veins these scorching heats away
or if he saw the danger did increase
to warn him fair and let him part in peace
my life for yours no hazard in your case
the quack replies your voice your pulse your face


good signs afford and what you seem to feel
proceeds from vapours which well help with steel
with kindled rage more than distemper burns
the suffring man who thus in haste returns
no more of vapours your belovd disease
your ignorances skreen your whatyouplease
with which you cheat poor females of their lives
whilst men dispute not so it rid their wives
for me ill speak free as ive paid my fees
my flesh consumes i perish by degrees


and as thro weary nights i count my pains
no rest is left me and no strength remains
all for the better sir the quack rejoins
exceeding promising are all these signs
fallingaway your nurses can confirm
was neer in sickness thought a mark of harm
the want of strength is for the better still
since men of vigour fevers soonest kill
evn with this gust of passion i am pleasd
for theyre most patient who the most are seizd


but let me see heres that which all repels
then shakes as he some formal story tells
the treaclewater mixt with powderd shells
my stomachs gone what dyou infer from thence
nor will with the least sustenance dispense
the better for where appetite endures
meats intermingle and no medcine cures
the stomach you must know sir is a part
but sure i feel deaths pangs about my heart


nay then farewel i need no more attend
the quack replies a sad approaching friend
questions the sick why he retires so fast
who says because of fees ive paid the last
and whilst all symptoms towrd my cure agree
am for the better dying as you see


observe this piece which to our sight does bring
the fittest posture for the swedish king
encompassd as we think with armies round
tho not expressd within this narrow bound
who whilst his warlike and extended hand
directs the foremost ranks to charge or stand
reverts his face lest that so fair and young
should call in doubt the orders of his tongue
whilst the excited and emboldend rear
such youth beholding and such features there
devote their plainer forms and are ashamd to fear
thus evry action evry grace of thine
o latest son of fame son of gustavus line
affects thy troops with all that can inspire
a blooming sweetness and a martial fire


fatal to none but thy invading foe
so lightnings which to all their brightness shew
strike but the man alone who has provokd the blow


tis fit serena shoud be sung
highborn serena fair and young
shoud be of evry muse and voice
the pleasing and applauded choice
but as the meanest of the show
do first in all processions go
so let my steps pursue that swain
the humblest of th inspired train
whose wellmeant verse did just appear
to lead on the preceding year


so let my pen the next in fame
now wait on fair serenas name
the second tribute gladly pay
and hail this blest returning day
but let it not attempt to raise
or rightly speak serenas praise
since with more ease we might declare
how great her predecessors were
how great that more distinguishd peer
to whom she owes her being here
in whom our britain lets us see
what once they were and still shoud be
as when the earliest race was drownd
some patterns from amongst them found
were kept to shew succeeding times
their excellence without their crimes
more easily we might express
what vertues do her mother dress
what does her form and mind adorn
of whom th engaging nymph was born


what piety what generous love
does the enlarged bosom move
of her whose favrite she appears
who more than as a niece endears
such full perfections obvious lie
and strike at first a poets eye
deep lines of honour all can hit
or mark out a superior wit
consummate goodness all can show
and where such graces shine below
but the more tender strokes to trace
t express the promise of a face
when but the dawnings of the mind
we from the air unripend find
which altring as new moments rise
the pen or pencils art defies
when flesh and blood in youth appears
polishd like what our marble wears
fresh as that shade of opning green
which first upon our groves is seen


enlivend by a harmless fire
and brightend by each gay desire
these nicer touches woud demand
a cowleys or a wallers hand
texplain with undisputed art
what tis affects thenlightend heart
when evry darker thought gives way
whilst blooming beauty we survey
to shew how all thats soft and sweet
does in the fair serena meet
to tell us with a sure presage
the charms of her maturer age


when hothfeild shall as heretofore
from its farsought and virtuous store
it families of great renown
did with illustrious hymens crown
when hothfeild shall such treasure know
as fair serena to bestow
then shoud some muse of loftier wing
the triumphs of that season sing


describe the pains the hopes the fears
of noble youths thambitious cares
of fathers the longframd design
to add such splendour to their line
whilst all shall strive for such a bride
so educated and allyd


a wit transported with inditing
unpayd unpraisd yet ever writing
who for all fights and favrite friends
had poems at his fingers ends
for new events was still providing
yet now desirous to be riding
he packdup evry ode and ditty
and in vacation left the city
so rapt with figures and allusions
with secret passions sweet confusions


with sentences from plays wellknown
and thousand couplets of his own
that evn the chalky road lookd gay
and seemd to him the milky way
but fortune who the ball is tossing
and poets ever will be crossing
misled the steed which ill he guided
where several gloomy paths divided
the steepest in descent he followd
enclosd by rocks which time had hollowd


till he believd alive and booted
hed reachd the shades by homer quoted
but all that he coud there discover
was in a pit with thorns grown over
old mammon digging straining sweating
as bags of gold he thence was getting
who when reprovd for such dejections
by him who livd on high reflections
replyd brave sir your time is ended
and poetry no more befriended


i hid this coin when charles was swaying
when all was riot masking playing
when witty beggars were in fashion
and learning had oerrun the nation
but since mankind is so much wiser
that none is valued like the miser
i draw it hence and now these sums
in proper soil grow up to plumbs
which gatherd once from that rich minute
we rule the world and all thats in it


but quoth the poetcan you raise
as well as plumbtrees groves of bays
where you which i woud chuse much rather
may fruits of reputation gather
will men of quality and spirit
regard you for intrinsick merit
and seek you out before your betters
for conversation wit and letters


fool quoth the churl who knew no breeding
have these been times for such proceeding
instead of honourd and rewarded
are you not slighted or discarded
what have you met with but disgraces
your prior coud not keep in places
and your vanbrug had found no quarter
but for his dabbling in the morter


rowe no advantages coud hit on
till verse he left to write northbriton
philips whos by the shilling known
neer saw a shilling of his own
meets b philomela in the town
her due proportion of renown
what prefrence has ardelia seen
texpel tho she coud write the spleen
of coach or tables can you brag
or better cloaths than poet rag
do wealthy kindred when they meet you
with kindness or distinction greet you
or have your lately flatterd heroes
enrichd you like the roman maroes


noquoth the man of broken slumbers
yet we have patrons for our numbers
there are mecænass among em
quoth mammonpray sir do not wrong em
but in your censures use a conscience
nor charge great men with thriftless nonsense


since they as your own poets sing
now grant no worth in any thing
but so much money as twill bring
then never more from your endeavours
expect preferment or less favours
but if youll scape contempt or worse
be sure put money in your purse
money which only can relieve you
when fame and friendship will deceive you


sir quoth the poet humbly bowing
and all that he had said allowing
behold me and my airy fancies
subdud like giants in romances
i here submit to your discourses
which since experience too enforces
i in that solitary pit
your gold withdrawn will hide my wit
till time which hastily advances
and gives to all new turns and chances
again may bring it into use
roscommons may again produce


new augustean days revive
when wit shall please and poets thrive
till when let those converse in private
who taste what others dont arrive at
yielding that mammonists surpass us
and let the bank outswell parnassus


poor river now thourt almost dry
what nymph or swain will near thee lie
since brought alas to sad decay
what flocks or herds will near thee stay
the swans that sought thee in thy pride
now on new streams forgetful ride
and fish that in thy bosom lay
chuse in more prosprous floods to play
all leave thee now thy ebb appears
to waste thy sad remains in tears
nor will thy mournful murmurs heed
fly wretched stream with all thy speed
amongst those solid rocks thy griefs bestow
for friends like those alas thou neer didst know
and thou poor sun that satst on high
but late the splendour of the sky


what flowr tho by thy influence born
now clouds prevail will towrds thee turn
now darkness sits upon thy brow
what persian votary will bow
what river will her smiles reflect
now that no beams thou canst direct
by watry vapours overcast
who thinks upon thy glories past
if present light nor heat we get
unheeded thou mayst rise and set
not all the past can one adorer keep
fall wretched sun to the more faithful deep


nor do thou lofty structure boast
since undermind by time and frost
since thou canst no reception give
in untrod meadows thou mayst live
none from his ready road will turn
with thee thy wretched change to mourn
not the soft nights or chearful days
thou hast bestowd can give thee praise


no lusty tree that near thee grows
tho it beneath thy shelter rose
will to thy age a staff become
fall wretched building to thy tomb
thou and thy painted roofs in ruin mixt
fall to the earth for that alone is fixt


the same poor man the same must be
thy fate now fortune frowns on thee
her favour evry one pursues
and losing her thou all must lose
no love sown in thy prosprous days
can fruit in this cold season raise
no benefit by thee conferrd
can in this time of storms be heard
all from thy troubld waters run
thy stooping fabrick all men shun
all do thy clouded looks decline
as if thou neer didst on them shine
o wretched man to other worlds repair
for faith and gratitude are only there


peace where art thou to be found
where in all the spacious round
may thy footsteps be pursud
where may thy calm seats be viewd
on some mountain dost thou lie
serenely near the ambient sky
smiling at the clouds below
where rough storms and tempests grow
or in some retired plain
undisturbd dost thou remain
where no angry whirlwinds pass
where no floods oppress the grass


high above or deep below
fain i thy retreat woud know
fain i thee alone woud find
balm to my oerwearyd mind
since what here the world enjoys
or our passions most employs
peace opposes or destroys
pleasures a tumultuous thing
busy still and still on wing


flying swift from place to place
darting from each beauteous face
from each strongly mingled bowl
through thinflamd and restless soul
sovreign powr who fondly craves
but himself to pomp enslaves
stands the envy of mankind
peace in vain attempts to find
thirst of wealth no quiet knows
but near the deathbed fiercer grows


wounding men with secret stings
for evils it on others brings
war who not discreetly shuns
thorough life the gauntlet runs
swords and pikes and waves and flames
each their stroke against him aims
love if such a thing there be
is all despair or extasie
poetrys the feavrish fit
th oerflowing of unbounded wit


farewel lovd youth since twas the will of heaven
so soon to take what had so late been givn
and thus our expectations to destroy
raising a grief where we had formd a joy


who once believd it was the fates design
in him to double an illustrious line
and in a second channel spread that race
where evry virtue shines with every grace
but we mistook and twas not here below
that this engrafted scion was to grow
the seats above requird him that each sphere
might soon the offspring of such parents share


resign him then to the supream intent
you who but flesh to that blest spirit lent
again disrobd let him to bliss retire
and only bear from you amidst that choir
what precept or example did inspire
a title to rewards from that rich store
of pious works which you have sent before
then lay the fading reliques which remain
in the still vault excluding farther pain
where kings and counsellors their progress close
and his renowned ancestors repose


where coventry withdrew all but in name
leaving the world his benefits and fame
where his paternal predecessor lies
once large of thought and rankd among the wise
whose genius in longleat we may behold
a pile as noble as if hed been told
by weymouth it shoud be in time possest
and strove to suit the mansion to the guest
nor favourd nor disgracd there essex sleeps
nor somerset his masters sorrows weeps
who to the shelter of th unenvyd grave
conveyd the monarch whom he coud not save
though romanlike his own lessvalud head
he profferd in that injurd martyrs stead
nor let that matchless female scape my pen
who their whole duty taught to weaker men
and of each sex the two best gifts enjoyd
the skill to write the modesty to hide


whilst none shoud that performance disbelieve
who led the life might the directions give
with such as these whence he derivd his blood
great on record or eminently good
let him be laid till deaths long night shall cease
and breaking glory interrupt the peace
meanwhile ye living parents ease your grief
by tears allowd as natures due relief
for when we offer to the powrs above
like you the dearest objects of our love
when with that patient saint in holy writ
weve learnt at once to grieve and to submit
when contrite sighs like hallowd incense rise
bearing our anguish to th appeased skies
then may those showrs which take from sorrow birth
and still are tending towrd this baleful earth
oer all our deep and parching cares diffuse
like edens springs or hermons softning dews


but lend your succours ye almighty powrs
for as the wound the balsam too is yours
in vain are numbers or persuasive speech
what poets write or what the pastors teach
till you who make again repair the breach
for when to shades of death our joys are fled
when for a loss like this our tears are shed
none can revive the heart but who can raise the dead
but yet my muse if thou hadst softer verse
than eer bewaild the melancholy herse
if thou hadst powr to dissipate the gloom
inherent to the solitary tomb
to rescue thence the memory and air
of what we lately saw so fresh so fair
then shoud this noble youth thy art engage
to shew the beauties of his blooming age
the pleasing light that from his eyes was cast
like hasty beams too vigorous to last


where the warm soul as on the confines lay
ready for flight and for eternal day
gently disposd his nature shoud be shown
and all the mothers sweetness made his own
the fathers likeness was but faintly seen
as ripend fruits are figurd by the green
nor coud we hope had he fulfilld his days
he shoud have reachd weymouths unequald praise
still one distinguishd plant each lineage shews
and all the rest beneath its stature grows
of tullys race but he possessd the tongue
and none like julius from the caesars sprung
next in his harmless sports he shoud be drawn
urging his courser oer the flowry lawn
sprightly himself as the enlivend game
bold in the chace and full of genrous flame
yet in the palace tractable and mild
perfect in all the duties of a child


which fond reflection pleases whilst it pains
like penetrating notes of sad harmonious strains
selected friendships timely he began
and siezed in youth that best delight of man
leaving a growing race to mourn his end
their earliest and their ages promisd friend
but far away alas that prospect moves
lost in the clouds like distant hills and groves
whilst with encreasing steps we all pursue
what time alone can bring to nearer view
that future state which darkness yet involves
known but by death which evry doubt resolves


weary at last of the pindarick way
thro which adventrously the muse woud stray
to fable i descend with soft delight
pleasd to translate or easily endite


whilst aery fictions hastily repair
to fill my page and rid my thoughts of care
as they to birds and beasts new gifts impart
and teach as poets shoud whilst they divert


but here the critick bids me check this vein
fable he crys tho grown th affected strain
but dies as it was born without regard or pain
whilst of his aim the lazy trifler fails
who seeks to purchase fame by childish tales


then let my verse once more attempt the skies
the easily persuaded poet cries
since meaner works you men of taste despise
the walls of troy shall be our loftier stage
our mighty theme the fierce achilles rage
the strength of hector and ulysses arts
shall boast such language to adorn their parts


as neither hobbes nor chapman coud bestow
or did from congreve or from dryden flow
amidst her towers the dedicated horse
shall be receivd big with destructive force
till men shall say when flames have brought her down
troy is no more and ilium was a town


is this the way to please the men of taste
the interrupter cries this old bombast
im sick of troy and in as great a fright
when some dull pedant woud her wars recite
as was soft paris when compelld to fight


to shades and springs shall we awhile repair
the muse demands and in that milder air
describe some gentle swains unhappy smart
whose folded arms still press upon his heart
and deeper drive the too far enterd dart
whilst phillis with a careless pleasure reigns
the joy the grief the envy of the plains


heightens the beauty of the verdant woods
and softens all the murmurs of the floods


oh stun me not with these insipid dreams
th eternal hush the lullaby of streams
which still he cries their even measures keep
till both the writers and the readers sleep
but urge thy pen if thou wouldst move our thoughts
to shew us private or the publick faults
display the times highchurch or low provoke
well praise the weapon as we like the stroke
and warmly sympathizing with the spite
apply to thousands what of one you write


then must that single stream the town supply
the harmless fablewriter dos reply
and all the rest of helicon be dry
and when so many choice productions swarm
must only satire keep your fancies warm


whilst even there you praise with such reserve
as if youd in the midst of plenty starve
tho neer so liberally we authors carve


happy the men whom we divert with ease
whom operas and panegyricks please


through evry age some tyrant passion reigns
now love prevails and now ambition gains
reasons lost throne and sovreign rule maintains
tho beyond loves ambitions empire goes
for who feels love ambition also knows
and proudly still aspires to be possest
of her he thinks superior to the rest


as coud be provd but that our plainer task
dos no such toil or definitions ask
but to be so rehearsd as first twas told
when such old stories pleasd in days of old


a king observing how a shepherds skill
improvd his flocks and did the pastures fill
that equal care th assaulted did defend
and the securd and grazing part attend
approves the conduct and from sheep and curs
transfers the sway and changed his wool to furrs
lordkeeper now as rightly he divides
his just decrees and speedily decides
when his sole neighbor whilst he watchd the fold
a hermit poor in contemplation old
hastes to his ear with safe but lost advice
tells him such heights are levelld in a trice
preferments treachrous and her paths of ice


and that already sure t had turnd his brain
who thought a princes favour to retain
nor seemd unlike in this mistaken rank
the sightless wretch who froze upon a bank
a serpent found which for a staff he took
and usd as such his own but lately broke
thanking the fates who thus his loss supplyd
nor marking one that with amazement cryd
throw quickly from thy hand that sleeping ill
a serpent tis that when awakd will kill


a serpent this th uncautiond fool replies
a staff it feels nor shall my want of eyes
make me believe i have no senses left
and thro thy malice be of this bereft
which fortune to my hand has kindly sent
to guide my steps and stumbling to prevent
no staff the man proceeds but to thy harm
a snake twill prove the viper now grown warm
confirmd it soon and fastend on his arm


thus wilt thou find shepherd believe it true
some ill that shall this seeming good ensue
thousand distastes t allay thy envyd gains
unthought of on the parcimonious plains
so provd the event and whisprers now defame
the candid judge and his proceedings blame
by wrongs they say a palace he erects
the good oppresses and the bad protects
to view this seat the king himself prepares
where no magnificence or pomp appears
but moderation free from each extream
whilst moderation is the builders theme
ashamd yet still the sycophants persist
that wealth he had conceald within a chest


which but attended some convenient day
to face the sun and brighter beams display
the chest unbarrd no radiant gems they find
no secret sums to foreign banks designd
but humble marks of an obscure recess
emblems of care and instruments of peace


the hook the scrip and for unblamd delight
the merry bagpipe which ere fall of night
coud sympathizing birds to tuneful notes invite
welcome ye monuments of former joys
welcome to bless again your masters eyes
and draw from courts th instructed shepherd cries
no more dear relicks we no more will part
you shall my hands employ who now revive my heart
no emulations nor corrupted times
shall falsely blacken or seduce to crimes
him whom your honest industry can please
who on the barren down can sing from inward ease


hows this the monarch something movd rejoins
with such low thoughts and freedom from designs
what made thee leave a life so fondly prizd
to be in crouds or envyd or despisd


forgive me sir and humane frailty see
the swain replies in my past state and me
all peaceful that to which i vow return
but who alas tho mine at length i mourn
was eer without the curse of some ambition born


urania whom the town admires
whose wit and beauty share our praise
this fair urania who inspires
a thousand joys a thousand ways
she who coud with a glance convey
favours that had my hopes outdone
has lent me money on that day
which our acquaintance first begun


nor with the happiness i taste
let any jealous doubts contend
her friendship is secure to last
beginning where all others end


and thou known cheat upheld by law
thou disappointer of the craving mind
bassette who thy original dost draw
from venice by uncertain seas confind
author of murmurs and of care
of pleasing hopes concluding in despair
to thee my strange felicity i owe
from thy oppression did this succour flow
less had i gained hadst thou propitious been
who better by my loss hast taught me how to win


yet tell me my transported brain
whose pride this benefit awakes
knowst thou what on this chance depends
and are we not exalted thus in vain
whilst we observe the money which she lends
but not alas the heart she takes
the fond engagements and the ties
her fatal bounty does impose
who makes reprisals with her eyes
for what her genrous hand bestows


and tho i quickly can return
those useful pieces which she gave
can i again or woud i have
that which her charms have from me borne


yet let us quit th obliging score
and whilst we borrowd gold restore
whilst readily we own the debt
and gratitude before her set
in its approved and fairest light
let her effectually be taught
by that instructive harmless slight
that also in her turn she ought
repaying evry tender thought
kindness with kindness to requite


fair youth who wish the wars may cease
we own you better formd for peace
nor pallas you nor mars shoud follow
your gods are cupid and apollo
who give sweet looks and early rhimes
bespeaking joys and halcyon times
your face which we as yet may praise
calls for the myrtle and the bays
the martial crowns fatigues demand
and laurelld heroes must be tannd
a fate we never can allow
shoud reach your pleasing polishd brow
but granting what so young youve writ
from nature flowd as well as wit
and that indeed you peace pursue
we must begin to treat with you


we females sir it is i mean
whilst i like bristol for the queen
for all the ladies of your age
as plenipo betimes engage
and as first article declare
you shall be faithful as youre fair
no sighs when you shall know their use
shall be dischargd in loves abuse
nor kindling words shall undermine
till you in equal passion join
nor money be alone your aim
tho you an overweight may claim
and fairly build on your desert
if with your person goes your heart
but when this barrier i have gaind
and trust it will be well maintaind
who knows but some imprudent she
betraying whats securd by me
shall yield thro verse or stronger charms
to treat anew on easier terms


and i be negligently told
you was too young and i too old
to have our distant maxims hold


sooner id praise a cloud which light beguiles
than thy rash hand which robs this face of smiles
and does that sweet and pleasing air controul
which to us paints the fair cleones soul
tis vain to boast of rules or labourd art
i miss the look that captivates my heart
attracts my love and tender thoughts inspires
nor can my breast be warmd by common fires
nor can ardelia love but where she first admires
like jupiters thy head was sure in pain
when this virago struggld in thy brain


and strange it is thou hast not made her wield
a mortal dart or penetrating shield
giving that hand of disproportiond size
the powr of which thou hast disarmd her eyes
as if like amazons she must oppose
and into lovers force her vanquishd foes
had to theanor thus her form been shown
to gain her heart he had not lost his own
nor by the gentlest bands of human life
at once securd the mistress and the wife


for still cleones beauties are the same
and what first lightend still upholds his flame
fain his compassion woud thy works approve
were pitying thee consistent with his love
or with the taste which italy has wrought
in his refind and daily heightend thought
where poetry or painting find no place
unless performd with a superior grace
coud but my wish some influence infuse
neer shoud the pencil or the sistermuse
be tryd by those who easily excuse


but strictest censors shoud of either judge
applaud the artist and despise the drudge
then never woud thy colours have debasd
cleones features and her charms defacd
nor had my pen more subject to their laws
assayd to vindicate her beautys cause
a rigid fear had kept us both in awe
nor i composd nor thou presumd to draw
but in cleone viewing with surprize
that excellence to which we neer coud rise


by less attempts we safely might have gaind
that humble praise which neither has obtaind
since to thy shadowings or my ruder verse
it is not givn to shew or to rehearse
what nature in cleones face has writ
a soft endearment and a chearful wit
that allsubduing that enlivning air
by which a sympathizing joy we share
for who forbears to smile when smild on by the fair


bright matchless star the honour of the sky
from whose clear shine heavens vault hath all his light
i send these poems to your graceful eye
do you but take them and they have their right
i build besides a temple to your name
wherein my thoughts shall daily sing your praise
and will erect an altar for the same
which shall your virtues and your honour raise
but heaven the temple of your honour is
whose brasen tops your worthy self made proud
the ground an altar base for such a bliss
with pity torn because i sighed so loud


and since my skill no worship can impart
make you an incense of my loving heart
sad all alone not long i musing sat
but that my thoughts compelled me to aspire
a laurel garland in my hand i gat
so the muses i approached the nigher
my suite was this a poet to become
to drink with them and from the heavens be fed
phoebus denied and sware there was no room
such to be poets as fond fancy led
with that i mourned and sat me down to weep
venus she smiled and smiling to me said
come drink with me and sit thee still and sleep
this voice i heard and venus i obeyed
that poison sweet hath done me all this wrong
for now of love must needs be all my song


weary was love and sought to take his rest
he made his choice upon a virgins lap
and slyly crept from thence unto her breast
where still he meant to sport him in his hap
the virgin frowned like phoebus in a cloud
go pack sir boy here is no room for such
my breast no wanton foolish boy must shroud
this said my love did give the wag a touch
then as the foot that treads the stinging snake
hastes to be gone for fear what may ensue
so love my love was forced for to forsake
and for more speed without his arrows flew
pardon he said for why you seemed to me
my mother venus in her pride to be


the heavens beheld the beauty of my queen
and all amazed to wonder thus began
why dotes not jove as erst we all have seen
and shapes himself like to a seemly man
mean are the matches which he sought before
like bloomless buds too base to make compare
and she alone hath treasured beautys store
in whom all gifts and princely graces are
cupid replied i posted with the sun
to view the maids that lived in those days
and none there was that might not well be won
but she most hard most cold made of delays
heavens were deceived and wrong they do esteem
she hath no heat although she living seem


love and my love did range the forest wild
mounted alike upon swift coursers both
love her encountered though he was a child
lets strive saith he whereat my love was wroth
and scorned the boy and checked him with a smile
i mounted am and armed with my spear
thou art too weak thyself do not beguile
i could thee conquer if i naked were
with this love wept and then my love replied
kiss me sweet boy so weep my boy no more
thus did my love and then her force she tried
love was made ice that fire was before
a kiss of hers as i poor soul do prove
can make the hottest freeze and coldest love


love with her hair my love by force hath tied
to serve her lips her eyes her voice her hand
i smiled for joy when i the boy espied
to lie unchained and live at her command
she if she look or kiss or sing or smile
cupid withal doth smile doth sing doth kiss
lips hands voice eyes all hearts that may beguile
because she scorns all hearts but only this
venus for this in pride began to frown
that cupid born a god enthralled should be
she in disdain her pretty son threw down
and in his place with love she chained me
so now sweet love though i myself be thrall
not her a goddess but thyself i call


my love amazed did blush herself to see
pictured by art all naked as she was
how could the painter know so much by me
or art effect what he hath brought to pass
it is not like he naked me hath seen
or stood so nigh for to observe so much
no sweet his eyes so near have never been
nor could his hands by art have cunning such
i showed my heart wherein you printed were
you naked you as here you painted are
in that my love your picture i must wear
and showt to all unless you have more care
then take my heart and place it with your own
so shall you naked never more be known


death in a rage assaulted once my heart
with love of her my love that doth deny
i scorned his force and wished him to depart
i heartless was and therefore could not die
i live in her in her i placed my life
she guides my soul and her i honour must
nor is this life but yet a living strife
a thing unmeet and yet a thing most just
cupid enraged did fly to make me love
my heart lay guarded with those burning eyes
the sparks whereof denied him to remove
so conquered now he like a captive lies
thus two at once by love were both undone
my heart not loved and armless venus son


hard are the rocks the marble and the steel
the ancient oak with wind and weather tossed
but you my love far harder do i feel
than flint or these or is the winters frost
my tears too weak your heart they cannot move
my sighs that rock like wind it cannot rent
too tigerlike you swear you cannot love
but tears and sighs you fruitless back have sent
the frost too hard not melted with my flame
i cinders am and yet you feel no heat
surpass not these sweet love for very shame
but let my tears my vows my sighs entreat
then shall i say as by trial find
these all are hard but you my love are kind


love was laid down all weary fast asleep
whereas my love his armor took away
the boy awaked and straight began to weep
but stood amazed and knew not what to say
weep not my boy said venus to her son
thy weapons none can wield but thou alone
licia the fair this harm to thee hath done
i saw her here and presently was gone
she will restore them for she hath no need
to take thy weapons where thy valour lies
for men to wound the fates have her decreed
with favour hands with beauty and with eyes
no venus no she scorns them credit me
but robbed thy son that none might care for thee


a painter drew the image of the boy
swift love with wings all naked and yet blind
with bow and arrows bent for to destroy
i blamed his skill and fault i thus did find
a needless task i see thy cunning take
misled by love thy fancy thee betrayed
love is no boy nor blind as men him make
nor weapons wears whereof to be affrayed
but if thou love wilt paint with greatest skill
a love a maid a goddess and a queen
wonder and view at licias picture still
for other love the world hath never seen
for she alone all hope all comfort gives
mens hearts souls all led by her favour lives


in ida vale three queens the shepherd saw
queens of esteem divine they were all three
a sight of worth but i a wonder shaw
their virtues all in one alone to be
licia the fair surpassing venus pride
the matchless queen commander of the gods
when drawn with doves she in her pomp doth ride
hath far more beauty and more grace by odds
juno joves wife unmeet to make compare
i grant a goddess but not half so mild
minerva wise a virtue but not rare
yet these are mean if that my love but smiled
she them surpasseth when their prides are full
as far as they surpass the meanest trull


i wish sometimes although a worthless thing
spurred by ambition glad to aspire
myself a monarch or some mighty king
and then my thoughts do wish for to be higher
but when i view what winds the cedars toss
what storms men feels that covet for renown
i blame myself that i have wished my loss
and scorn a kingdom though it give a crown
ah licia though the wonder of my thought
my hearts content procurer of my bliss
for whom a crown i do esteem as naught
as asias wealth too mean to buy a kiss
kiss me sweet love this favor do for me
then crowns and kingdoms shall i scorn for thee


enamored jove commanding did entreat
cupid to wound my love which he denied
and swore he could not for she wanted heat
and would not love as he full oft had tried
jove in a rage impatient this to hear
replied with threats ill make you to obey
whereat the boy did fly away for fear
to licias eyes where safe intrenched he lay
then jove he scorned and dared him to his face
for now more safe than in the heavens he dwelled
nor could joves wrath do wrong to such a place
where grace and honour have their kingdom held
thus in the pride and beauty of her eyes
the seely boy the greatest god defies


my love lay sleeping where birds music made
shutting her eyes disdainful of the light
the heat was great but greater was the shade
which her defended from his burning sight
this cupid saw and came a kiss to take
sucking sweet nectar from her sugared breath
she felt the touch and blushed and did awake
seeing twas love which she did think was death
she cut his wings and caused him to stay
making a vow he should not thence depart
unless to her the wanton boy could pay
the truest kindest and most loving heart
his feathers still she used for a fan
till by exchange my heart his feathers won


i stood amazed and saw my licia shine
fairer than phoebus in his brightest pride
set forth in colors by a hand divine
where naught was wanting but a soul to guide
it was a picture that i could descry
yet made with art so as it seemed to live
surpassing fair and yet it had no eye
whereof my senses could no reason give
with that the painter bid me not to muse
her eyes are shut but i deserve no blame
for if she saw in faith it could not choose
but that the work had wholly been a flame
then burn me sweet with brightness of your eyes
that phoenixlike from thence i may arise


grant fairest kind a kiss unto thy friend
a blush replied and yet a kiss i had
it is not heaven that can such nectar send
whereat my senses all amazed were glad
this done she fled as one that was affrayed
and i desired to kiss by kissing more
my love she frowned and i my kissing stayed
yet wished to kiss her as i did before
then as the vine the propping elm doth clasp
loath to depart till both together die
so fold me sweet until my latest gasp
that in thy arms to death i kissed may lie
thus whilst i live for kisses i must call
still kiss me sweet or kiss me not at all


as are the sands fair licia on the shore
or colored flowers garlands of the spring
or as the frosts not seen not felt before
or as the fruits that autumn forth doth bring
as twinkling stars the tinsel of the night
or as the fish that gallop in the seas
as airs each part that still escapes our sight
so are my sighs controllers of my ease
yet these are such as needs must have an end
for things finite none else hath nature done
only the sighs which from my heart i send
will never cease but where they first begun
accept them sweet as incense due to thee
for you immortal made them so to be


i swear fair licia still for to be thine
by heart by eyes by what i held most dear
thou checked mine oath and said these were not mine
and that i had no right by them to swear
then by my sighs my passions and my tears
my vows my prayers my sorrow and my love
my grief my joy my hope and hopeless fears
my heart is thine and never shall remove
these are not thine though sent unto thy view
all else i grant by right they are thine own
let these suffice that what i swear is true
and more than this if that it could be known
so shall all these though troubles ease my grief
if that they serve to work in thee belief


that time fair licia when i stole a kiss
from off those lips where cupid lovely laid
i quaked for cold and found the cause was this
my life which loved for love behind me staid
i sent my heart my life for to recall
but that was held not able to return
and both detained as captives were in thrall
and judged by her that both by sighs should burn
fair burn them both for that they were so bold
but let the altar be within thy heart
and i shall live because my life you hold
you that give life to every living part
a flame i took whenas i stole the kiss
take you my life yet can i live with this


first did i fear when first my love began
possessed in fits by watchful jealousy
i sought to keep what i by favour won
and brooked no partner in my love to be
but tyrant sickness fed upon my love
and spread his ensigns dyed with colour white
then was suspicion glad for to remove
and loving much did fear to lose her quite
erect fair sweet the colors thou didst wear
dislodge thy griefs the shortners of content
for now of life not love is all my fear
lest life and love be both together spent
live but fair love and banish thy disease
and love kind heart both where and whom thou please


licia my love was sitting in a grove
tuning her smiles unto the chirping songs
but straight she spied where two together strove
each one complaining of the others wrongs
cupid did cry lamenting of the harm
joves messenger thou wrongst me too too far
use thou thy rod rely upon the charm
think not by speech my force thou canst debar
a rod sir boy were fitter for a child
my weapons oft and tongue and mind you took
and in my wrong at my distress thou smiled
and scorned to grace me with a loving look
speak you sweet love for you did all the wrong
that broke his arrows and did bind his tongue


i might have died before my life begun
whenas my father for his countrys good
the persians favor and the sophy won
and yet with danger of his dearest blood
thy father sweet whom danger did beset
escaped all and for no other end
but only this that you he might beget
whom heavens decreed into the world to send
then father thank thy daughter for thy life
and neptune praise that yielded so to thee
to calm the tempest when the storms were rife
and that thy daughter should a venus be
i call thee venus sweet but be not wroth
thou art more chaste yet seas did favor both


my love was masked and armed with a fan
to see the sun so careless of his light
which stood and gazed and gazing waxed wan
to see a star himself that was more bright
some did surmize she hid her from the sun
of whom in pride she scorned for to be kissed
or feared the harm by him to others done
but these the reason of this wonder missed
nor durst the sun if that her face were bare
in greatest pride presume to take a kiss
but she more kind did show she had more care
than with her eyes eclipse him of his bliss
unmask you sweet and spare not dim the sun
your lights enough although that his were done


whenas my love lay sickly in her bed
pale death did post in hope to have a prey
but she so spotless made him that he fled
unmeet to die she cried and could not stay
back he retired and thus the heavens he told
all things that are are subject unto me
both towns and men and what the world doth hold
but her fair licia still immortal be
the heavens did grant a goddess she was made
immortal fair unfit to suffer change
so now she lives and never more shall fade
in earth a goddess what can be more strange
then will i hope a goddess and so near
she cannot choose my sighs and prayers but hear


seven are the lights that wander in the skies
and at these seven i wonder in my love
so see the moon how pale she doth arise
standing amazed as though she durst not move
so is my sweet much paler than the snow
constant her looks these looks that cannot change
mercury the next a god sweettongued we know
but her sweet voice doth wonders speak more strange
the rising sun doth boast him of his pride
and yet my love is far more fair than he
the warlike mars can wieldless weapons guide
but yet that god is far more weak than she
the lovely venus seemeth to be fair
but at her best my love is far more bright
saturn for age with groans doth dim the air
whereas my love with smiles doth give it light
gaze at her brows where heaven ingrafted is
then sigh and swear there is no heaven but this


i live sweet love whereas the gentle wind
murmurs with sport in midst of thickest boughs
where loving woodbine doth the harbor bind
and chirping birds do echo forth my vows
where strongest elm can scarce support the vine
and sweetest flowers enameled have the ground
where muses dwell and yet hereat repine
that on the earth so rare a place was found
but winds delight i wish to be content
i praise the woodbine but i take no joy
i moan the birds that music thus have spent
as for the rest they breed but mine annoy
live then fair licia in this place alone
then shall i joy though all of these were gone


the crystal stream wherein my love did swim
melted in tears as partners of my woe
her shine was such as did the fountain dim
the pearllike fountain whiter than the snow
then like perfume resolved with a heat
the fountain smoked as if it thought to burn
a wonder strange to see the cold so great
and yet the fountain into smoke to turn
i searched the cause and found it to be this
she touched the water and it burned with love
now by her means it purchased hath that bliss
which all diseases quickly can remove
then if by you these streams thus blessed be
sweet grant me love and be not worse to me


in time the strong and stately turrets fall
in time the rose and silver lilies die
in time the monarchs captive are and thrall
in time the sea and rivers are made dry
the hardest flint in time doth melt asunder
still living fame in time doth fade away
the mountains proud we see in time come under
and earth for age we see in time decay
the sun in time forgets for to retire
from out the east where he was wont to rise
the basest thoughts we see in time aspire
and greedy minds in time do wealth despise
thus all sweet fair in time must have an end
except thy beauty virtues and thy friend


why died i not whenas i last did sleep
o sleep too short that shadowed forth my dear
heavens hear my prayers nor thus me waking keep
for this were heaven if thus i sleeping were
for in that dark there shone a princely light
two milkwhite hills both full of nectar sweet
her ebon thighs the wonder of my sight
where all my senses with their objects meet
i pass these sports in secret that are best
wherein my thoughts did seem alive to be
we both did strive and weary both did rest
i kissed her still and still she kissed me
heavens let me sleep and shows my senses feed
or let me wake and happy be indeed


whenas my licia sailed in the seas
viewing with pride god neptunes stately crown
a calm she made and brought the merchant ease
the storm she stayed and checked him with a frown
love at the stern sate smiling and did sing
to see how seas had learned for to obey
and balls of fire into the waves did fling
and still the boy full wanton thus did say
both poles we burnt whereon the world doth turn
the round of heaven from earth unto the skies
and now the seas we both intend to burn
i with my bow and licia with her eyes
then since thy force heavens earth nor seas can move
i conquered yield and do confess i love


whenas her lute is tuned to her voice
the air grows proud for honour of that sound
and rocks do leap to show how they rejoice
that in the earth such music should be found
whenas her hair more worth more pale than gold
like silver thread lies wafting in the air
dianalike she looks but yet more bold
cruel in chase more chaste and yet more fair
whenas she smiles the clouds for envy breaks
she jove in pride encounters with a check
the sun doth shine for joy whenas she speaks
thus heaven and earth do homage at her beck
yet all these graces blots not graces are
if you my love of love do take no care


years months days hours in sighs i sadly spend
i black the night wherein i sleepless toss
i love my griefs yet wish them at an end
thus times expense increaseth but my loss
i musing stand and wonder at my love
that in so fair should be a heart of steel
and then i think my fancy to remove
but then more painful i my passions feel
thus must i love sweet fair until i die
and your unkindness doth my love increase
i conquered am i can it not deny
my life must end yet shall my love not cease
then heavens make licia fair most kind to me
or with my life my loss may finished be


i wrote my sighs and sent them to my love
i praised that fair that none enough could praise
but plaints nor praises could fair licia move
above my reach she did her virtues raise
and thus replied false scrawl untrue thou art
to feign those sighs that nowhere can be found
for half those praises came not from his heart
whose faith and love as yet was never found
thy masters life false scrawl shall be thy doom
because he burns i judge thee to the flame
both your attempts deserve no better room
thus at her word we ashes both became
believe me fair and let my paper live
or be not fair and so me freedom give


pale are my looks forsaken of my life
cinders my bones consumed with thy flame
floods are my tears to end this burning strife
and yet i sigh for to increase the same
i mourn alone because alone i burn
who doubts of this then let him learn to love
her looks cold ice into a flame can turn
as i distressed in myself do prove
respect fair licia what my torments are
count but the tithe both of my sighs and tears
see how my love doth still increase my care
and cares increase my life to nothing wears
send but a sigh my flame for to increase
or lend a tear and cause it so to cease


whenas i wish fair licia for a kiss
from those sweet lips where rose and lilies strive
straight do mine eyes repine at such a bliss
and seek my lips thereof for to deprive
whenas i seek to glut mine eyes by sight
my lips repine and call mine eyes away
thus both contend to have each others right
and both conspire to work my full decay
o force admired of beauty in her pride
in whose each part such strange effects there be
that all my forces in themselves divide
and make my senses plainly disagree
if all were mine this envy would be gone
then grant me all fair sweet or grant me none


hear how my sighs are echoed of the wind
see how my tears are pitied by the rain
feel what a flame possessed hath my mind
taste but the grief which i possess in vain
then if my sighs the blustering winds surpass
and watry tears the drops of rain exceed
and if no flame like mine nor is nor was
nor grief like that whereon my soul doth feed
relent fair licia when my sighs do blow
yield at my tears that flintlike drops consume
accept the flame that doth my incense show
allow the grief that is my hearts perfume
thus sighs and tears flame grief shall plead for me
so shall i pray and you a goddess be


i speak fair licia what my torments be
but then my speech too partial do i find
for hardly words can with those thoughts agree
those thoughts that swarm in such a troubled mind
then do i vow my tongue shall never speak
nor tell my grief that in my heart doth lie
but cannonlike i then surcharged do break
and so my silence worse than speech i try
thus speech or none they both do breed my care
i live dismayed and kill my heart with grief
in all respects my case alike doth fare
to him that wants and dare not ask relief
then you fair lucia sovereign of my heart
read to yourself my anguish and my smart


sweet i protest and seal it with an oath
i never saw that so my thoughts did please
and yet content displeased i see them wroth
to love so much and cannot have their ease
i told my thoughts my sovereign made a pause
disposed to grant but willing to delay
they then repined for that they knew no cause
and swore they wished she flatly would say nay
thus hath my love my thoughts with treason filled
and gainst my sovereign taught them to repine
so thus my treason all my thoughts hath killed
and made fair licia say she is not mine
but thoughts too rash my heart doth now repent
and as you please they swear they are content


fair matchless nymph respect but what i crave
my thoughts are true and honour is my love
i fainting die whom yet a smile might save
you gave the wound and can the hurt remove
those eyes like stars that twinkle in the night
and cheeks like rubies pale in lilies dyed
those ebon hands that darting hath such might
that _in_ my soul my love and life divide
accept the passions of a man possessed
let love be loved and grant me leave to live
disperse those clouds that darkened have my rest
and let your heaven a sunlike smile but give
then shall i praise that heaven for such a sun
that saved my life whenas my grief begun


my grief begun fair saint when first i saw
love in those eyes sit ruling with disdain
whose sweet commands did keep a world in awe
and caused them serve your favor to obtain
i stood as one enchanted with a frown
yet smiled to see all creatures serve those eyes
where each with sighs paid tribute to that crown
and thought them graced by your dumb replies
but i ambitious could not be content
till that my service more than sighs made known
and for that end my heart to you i sent
to say and swear that fair it is your own
then greater graces licia do impart
not dumb replies unto a speaking heart


poets did feign that heavens a venus had
matchless herself and cupid was her son
men sued to these and of their smiles were glad
by whom so many famous were undone
now cupid mourns that he hath lost his might
and that these two so comely are to see
and venus frowns because they have her right
yet both so like that both shall blameless be
with heavens two twins for godhead these may strive
and rule a world with least part of a frown
fairer than these two twins are not alive
both conquering queens and both deserve a crown
my thoughts presage which time to come shall try
that thousands conquered for their love shall die


if aged charon when my life shall end
i pass thy ferry and my waftage pay
thy oars shall fall thy boat and mast shall rend
and through the deep shall be a dry footway
for why my heart with sighs doth breathe such flame
that air and water both incensed be
the boundless ocean from whose mouth they came
for from my heat not heaven itself is free
then since to me thy loss can be no gain
avoid thy harm and fly what i foretell
make thou thy love with me for to be slain
that i with her and both with thee may dwell
thy fact thus charon both of us shall bless
thou save thy boat and i my love possess


for if alone thou think to waft my love
her cold is such as can the sea command
and frozen ice shall let thy boat to move
nor can thy forces row it from the land
but if thou friendly both at once shalt take
thyself mayst rest for why my sighs will blow
our cold and heat so sweet a thaw shall make
as that thy boat without thy help shall row
then will i sit and glut me on those eyes
wherewith my life my eyes could never fill
thus from my boat that comfort shall arise
the want whereof my life and hope did kill
together placed so thou her scorn shalt cross
where if we part thy boat must suffer loss


are those two stars her eyes my lifes light gone
by which my soul was freed from all dark
and am i left distressed to live alone
where none my tears and mournful tale shall mark
ah sun why shine thy looks thy looks like gold
when horsemen brave thou risest in the east
ah cynthia pale to whom my griefs i told
why do you both rejoice both man and beast
and i alone alone that dark possess
by licias absence brighter than the sun
whose smiling light did ease my sad distress
and broke the clouds when tears like rain begun
heavens grant that light and so me waking keep
or shut my eyes and rock me fast asleep


cruel fair love i justly do complain
of too much rigor and thy heart unkind
that for mine eyes thou hast my body slain
and would not grant that i should favour find
i looked fair love and you my love looked fair
i sighed for love and you for sport did smile
your smiles were such as did perfume the air
and this perfumed did my heart beguile
thus i confess the fault was in mine eyes
begun with sighs and ended with a flame
i for your love did all the world despise
and in these poems honored have your name
then let your love so with my fault dispense
that all my parts feel not mine eyes offense


there shone a comet and it was full west
my thoughts presaged what it did portend
i found it threatened to my heart unrest
and might in time my joys and comfort end
i further sought and found it was a sun
which day nor night did never use to set
it constant stood when heavens did restless run
and did their virtues and their forces let
the world did muse and wonder what it meant
a sun to shine and in the west to rise
to search the truth i strength and spirits spent
at length i found it was my licias eyes
now never after soul shall live in dark
that hath the hap this western sun to mark


if he be dead in whom no heart remains
or lifeless be in whom no life is found
if he do pine that never comfort gains
and be distressed that hath his deadly wound
then must i die whose heart elsewhere is clad
and lifeless pass the greedy worms to feed
then must i pine that never comfort had
and be distressed whose wound with tears doth bleed
which if i do why do i not wax cold
why rest i not like one that wants a heart
why move i still like him that life doth hold
and sense enjoy both of my joy and smart
like niobe queen which made a stone did weep
licia my heart dead and alive doth keep


like memnons rock touched with the rising sun
which yields a sound and echoes forth a voice
but when its drowned in western seas is done
and drowsylike leaves off to make a noise
so i my love enlightened with your shine
a poets skill within my soul i shroud
not rude like that which finer wits decline
but such as muses to the best allowed
but when your figure and your shape is gone
i speechless am like as i was before
or if i write my verse is filled with moan
and blurred with tears by falling in such store
then muse not licia if my muse be slack
for when i wrote i did thy beauty lack


i saw sweet licia when the spider ran
within your house to weave a worthless web
you present were and feared her with your fan
so that amazed speedily she fled
she in your house such sweet perfumes did smell
and heard the muses with their notes refined
thus filled with envy could no longer dwell
but straight returned and at your house repined
then tell me spider why of late i saw
thee lose thy poison and thy bowels gone
did these enchant and keep thy limbs in awe
and made thy forces to be small or none
no no thou didst by chance my licia see
who for her look minerva seemed to thee


if that i die fair licia with disdain
or heartless live surprised with thy wrong
then heavens and earth shall accent both my pain
and curse the time so cruel and so long
if you be kind my queen as you are fair
and aid my thoughts that still for conquest strive
then will i sing and never more despair
and praise your kindness whilst i am alive
till then i pay the tribute of my tears
to move thy mercy and thy constant truth
respect fair love how these with sorrow wears
the truest heart unless it find some ruth
then grace me sweet and with thy favor raise me
so shall i live and all the world shall praise thee


ah licia sigh and say thou art my own
nay be my own as you full oft have said
so shall your truth unto the world be known
and i resolved where now i am afraid
and if my tongue eternize can your praise
or silly speech increase your worthy fame
if ought i can to heaven your worth can raise
the age to come shall wonder at the same
in this respect your love sweet love i told
my faith and truth i vowed should be forever
you were the cause if that i was too bold
then pardon this my fault or love me never
but if you frown i wish that none believe me
for slain with sighs ill die before i grieve thee


when first the sun whom all my senses serve
began to shine upon this earthly round
the heavens for her all graces did reserve
that pandorlike with all she might abound
apollo placed his brightness in her eyes
his skill presaging and his music sweet
mars gave his force all force she now defies
venus her smiles wherewith she mars did meet
python a voice diana made her chaste
ceres gave plenty cupid lent his bow
thetis his feet there pallas wisdom placed
with these she queenlike kept a world in awe
yet all these honors deemed are but pelf
for she is much more worthy of herself


o sugared talk wherewith my thoughts do live
o brows loves trophy and my senses shine
o charming smiles that death or life can give
o heavenly kisses from a mouth divine
o wreaths too strong and trammels made of hair
o pearls inclosed in an ebon pale
o rose and lilies in a field most fair
where modest white doth make the red seem pale
o voice whose accents live within my heart
o heavenly hand that more than atlas holds
o sighs perfumed that can release my smart
o happy they whom in her arms she folds
now if you ask where dwelleth all this bliss
seek out my love and she will tell you this


love i repent me that i thought
my sighs and languish dearly bought
for sighs and languish both did prove
that he that languished sighed for love
cruel rigor foe to state
looks disdainful fraught with hate
i did blame but had no cause
love hath eyes but hath no laws
she was sad and could not choose
to see me sigh and sit and muse
we both did love and both did doubt
least any should our love find out
our hearts did speak by sighs most hidden
this means was left all else forbidden
i did frown her love to try
she did sigh and straight did cry
both of us did sighs believe
yet either grieved friend to grieve
i did look and then did smile
she left sighing all that while
both were glad to see that change
things in love that are not strange
suspicion foolish foe to reason
caused me seek to find some treason
i did court another dame
false in love it is a shame
she was sorry this to view
thinking faith was proved untrue
then she swore she would not love
one whom false she once did prove


i did vow i never meant
from promise made for to relent
the more i said the worse she thought
my oaths and vows were deemed as naught
false she said how can it be
to court another yet love me
crowns and love no partners brook
if she be liked i am forsook
farewell false and love her still
your chance was good but mine was ill


no harm to you but this i crave
that your new love may you deceive
and jest with you as you have done
for lights the love that quickly won
kind and fairsweet once believe me
jest i did but not to grieve thee
court i did but did not love
all my speech was you to prove
words and sighs and what i spent
in show to her to you were meant
fond i was your love to cross
jesting love oft brings this loss
forget this fault and love your friend
which vows his truth unto the end
content she said if this you keep
thus both did kiss and both did weep
for women long they cannot chide
as i by proof in this have tried


the seanymphs late did play them on the shore
and smiled to see such sport was new begun
a strife in love the like not heard before
two nymphs contend which had the conquest won
doris the fair with galate did chide
she liked her choice and to her taunts replied


thy love fair nymph that courts thee on this plain
as shepherds say and all the world can tell
is that foul rude sicilian cyclopswain
a shame sweet nymph that he with thee should mell


smile not fair doris though he foul do seem
let pass thy words that savour of disgrace
hes worth my love and so i him esteem
renowned by birth and come of neptunes race
neptune that doth the glassy ocean tame
neptune by birth from mighty jove which came


i grant an honour to be neptunes child
a grace to be so near with jove allied
but yet sweet nymph with this be not beguiled
where natures graces are by looks decried
so foul so rough so ugly as a clown
and worse than this a monster with one eye
foul is not graced though it wear a crown
but fair is beauty none can that deny


nor is he foul or shapeless as you say
or worse for that he clownish seems to be
rough satyrlike the better he will play
and manly looks the fitter are for me
his frowning smiles are graced by his beard
his eyelight sunlike shrouded is in one
this me contents and others make afeard
he sees enough and therefore wanteth none


nay then i see sweet nymph thou art in love
and loving dotes and doting dost commend
foul to be fair this oft do lovers prove
i wish him fairer or thy love an end


doris i love not yet i hardly bear
disgraceful terms which you have spoke in scorn
you are not loved and thats the cause i fear
for why my love of jove himself was born
feeding his sheep of late amidst this plain
whenas we nymphs did sport us on the shore
he scorned you all my love for to obtain
that grieved your hearts i knew as much before
nay smile not nymphs the truth i only tell
for few can brook that others should excel


should i envy that blind did you that spite
or that your shape doth please so foul a groom
the shepherd thought of milk you looked so white
the clown did err and foolish was his doom
your look was pale and so his stomach fed
but far from fair where white doth want his red


though pale my look yet he my love did crave
and lovely you unliked unloved i view
its better far one base than none to have
your fair is foul to whom theres none will sue
my love doth tune his love unto his harp
his shape is rude but yet his wit is sharp


leave off sweet nymph to grace a worthless clown
he itched with love and then did sing or say
the noise was such as all the nymphs did frown
and well suspected that some ass did bray
the woods did chide to hear this ugly sound
the prating echo scorned for to repeat
this grisly voice did fear the hollow ground
whilst artless fingers did his harpstrings beat
two bearwhelps in his arms this monster bore
with these new puppies did this wanton play
their skins was rough but yet your loves was more
he fouler was and far more fierce than they
i cannot choose sweet nymph to think but smile
that some of us thou fearst will thee beguile


scorn not my love until it can be known
that you have one thats better of your own


i have no love nor if i had would boast
yet wooed have been by such as well might speed
but him to love the shame of all the coast
so ugly foul as yet i have no need
now thus we learn what foolish love can do
to think him fair thats foul and ugly too
to hear this talk i sat behind an oak
and marked their words and penned them as they spoke


true are my thoughts my thoughts that are untrue
blind are my eyes my eyes that are not blind
new is my love my love that is not new
kind is that fair that fair that is not kind
thus eyes and thoughts that fairest fair my love
blind and untrue unkind unconstant prove


true are my thoughts because they never flit
untrue my thoughts because they me betrayed
blind are my eyes because in clouds i sit
not blind my eyes because i looks obeyed
thus eyes and thoughts my dearest fair may view
in sight in love not blind nor yet untrue


new is my love because it never dies
old is my love because it ever lives
kind is that fair because it hate denies
unkind that fair because no hope it gives
thus new my love and still that fair unkind
renews my love and i no favour find


sweet are my dreams my dreams that are not sweet
long are the nights the nights that are not long
meet are the pangs these pangs that are unmeet
wronged is my heart my heart that hath no wrong
thus dreams and night my heart my pangs and all
in taste in length conspire to work my fall


sweet are my dreams because my love they show
unsweet my dreams because but dreams they are
long are the nights because no help i know
meet are the nights because they end my care
thus dreams and nights wherein my love take sport
are sweet unsweet are long and yet too short


meet are my pangs because i was too bold
unmeet my pangs because i loved so well
wronged was my heart because my grief it told
not wronged for why my grief it could not tell
thus you my love unkindly cause this smart
that will not love to ease my pangs and heart


proud is her look her look that is not proud
done all my days my days that are not done
loud are my sighs my sighs that are not loud
begun my death my death not yet begun
thus looks and days and sighs and death might move
so kind so fair to give consent to love


proud is her look because she scorns to see
not proud her look for none dare say so much
done are my days because they hapless be
not done my days because i wish them such
thus looks and days increase this loving strife
not proud nor done nor dead nor giving life


loud are my sighs because they pierce the sky
not loud my sighs because they are not heard
my death begun because i artless cry
but not begun because i am debarred
thus sighs and death my heart no comfort give
both life deny and both do make me live


bold are her smiles her smiles that are not bold
wise are her words those words that are not wise
cold are her lips those lips that are not cold
ice are those hands those hands that are not ice
thus smiles and words her lips her hands and she
bold wise cold ice loves cruel torments be


bold are her smiles because they anger slay
not bold her smiles because they blush so oft
wise are her words because they wonders say
not wise her words because they are not soft
thus smiles and words so cruel and so bold
so blushing wise my thoughts in prison hold


cold are her lips because they breathe no heat
not cold her lips because my heart they burn
ice are her hands because the snows so great
not ice her hands that all to ashes turn
thus lips and hands cold ice my sorrow brew
hands warm white snow and lips cold cherryred


small was her waist the waist that was not small
gold was her hair the hair that was not gold
tall was her shape the shape that was not tall
folding the arms the arms that did not fold
thus hair and shape those folding arms and waist
did make me love and loving made me waste


small was her waist because i could it span
not small her waist because she wanted all
gold was her hair because a crown it wan
not gold her hair because it was more pale
thus smallest waist the greatest waste doth make
and finest hair most fast a lover take


tall was her shape because she touched the sky
not tall her shape because she comely was
folding her arms because she hearts could tie
not folded arms because all bands they pass
thus shape and arms with love my heart did ply
that hers i am and must be till i die


sad was her joy her joy that was not sad
short was her stay her stay that was not short
glad was her speech her speech that was not glad
sporting those toys those toys that were not sport
thus was my heart with joy speech toys and stay
possessed with love and so stoln quite away


sad was her joy because she did respect
not sad her joy because her joy she had
short was her stay because to small effect
long was her stay because i was so sad
thus joy and stay both crossed a lovers sport
the one was sad the other too too short


glad was her speech because she spake her mind
not glad her speech because afraid to speak
sporting her toys because my love was kind
not toys in sport because my heart they break
thus speech and toys my love began in jest
sweet yield to love and make thy servant blest


tread you the maze sweet love that i have run
mark but the steps which i imprinted have
end but your love whereas my thoughts begun
so shall i joy and you a servant have
if not sweet love then this my suit deny
so shall you live and so your servant die


down in a bed and on a bed of down
love she and i to sleep together lay
she like a wanton kissed me with a frown
sleep sleep she said but meant to steal away
i could not choose but kiss but wake but smile
to see how she thought us two to beguile


she feigned a sleep i waked her with a kiss
a kiss to me she gave to make me sleep
if i did wrong sweet love my fault was this
in that i did not you thus waking keep
then kiss me sweet that so i sleep may take
or let me kiss to keep you still awake


the night drew on and needs she must be gone
she waked love and bid him learn to wait
she sighed she said to leave me there alone
and bid love stay but practise no deceit
love wept for grief and sighing made great moan
and could not sleep nor stay if she were gone


then stay sweet love a kiss with that i gave
she could not stay but gave my kiss again
a kiss was all that i could get or crave
and with a kiss she bound me to remain
ah licia still i in my dreams did cry
come licia come or else my heart will die


distance of place my love and me did part
yet both did swear we never would remove
in sign thereof i bid her take my heart
which did and doth and can not choose but love
thus did we part in hope to meet again
where both did vow most constant to remain


a she there was that passed betwixt us both
by whom each knew how others cause did fare
for men to trust men in their love are loth
thus had we both of love a lovers care
haply he seeks his sorrows to renew
that for his love doth make another sue


by her a kiss a kiss to me she sent
a kiss for price more worth than purest gold
she gave it her to me the kiss was meant
a she to kiss what harm if she were bold
happy those lips that had so sweet a kiss
for heaven itself scarce yields so sweet a bliss


this modest she blushing for shame of this
or loth to part from that she liked so well
did play false play and gave me not the kiss
yet my loves kindness could not choose to tell
then blame me not that kissing sighed and swore
i kissed but her whom you had kissed before


sweet love me more and blame me not sweet love
i kissed those lips yet harmless i do vow
scarce would my lips from off those lips remove
for still methought sweet fair i kissed you
and thus kind love the sum of all my bliss
was but begun and ended in a kiss


then send me more but send them by your friend
kiss none but her nor her nor none at all
beware by whom such treasures you do send
i must them lose except i for them call
and love me dear and still still kissing be
both like and love but none sweet love but me


if sad complaint would show a lovers pain
or tears express the torments of my heart
if melting sighs would ruth and pity gain
or true laments but ease a lovers smart


then should my plaints the thunders noise surmount
and tears like seas should flow from out my eyes
then sighs like air should far exceed all count
and true laments with sorrow dim the skies


but plaints and tears laments and sighs i spend
yet greater torments do my heart destroy
i could all these from out my heart still send
if after these i might my love enjoy


but heavens conspire and heavens i must obey
that seeking love i still must want my ease
for greatest joys are tempered with delay
things soon obtained do least of all us please


my thoughts repine and think the time too long
my love impatient wisheth to obtain
i blame the heavens that do me all this wrong
to make me loved and will not ease my pain


no pain like this to love and not enjoy
no grief like this to mourn and not be heard
no time so long as that which breeds annoy
no hell like this to love and be deferred


but heaven shall stand and earth inconstant fly
the sun shall freeze and ice inconstant burn
the mountains flow and all the earth be dry
ere time shall force my loving thoughts to turn


do you resolve sweet love to do the same
say that you do and seal it with a kiss
then shall our truths the heavens unkindness blame
that can not hurt yet show their spite in this


the silly prentice bound for many years
doth hope that time his service will release
the town beseiged that lives in midst of fears
doth hope in time the cruel wars will cease


the toiling ploughman sings in hope to reap
the tossed bark expecteth for a shore
the boy at school to be at play doth leap
and straight forgets the fear he had before


if those by hope do joy in their distress
and constant are in hope to conquer time
then let not hope in us sweet friend be less
and cause our love to wither in the prime


let me conspire and time will have an end
so both of us in time shall have a friend


remote unfriended melancholy slow
or by the lazy scheldt or wandering po
or onward where the rude carinthian boor
against the houseless stranger shuts the door
or where campanias plain forsaken lies
a weary waste expanding to the skies
whereer i roam whatever realms to see
my heart untravelld fondly turns to thee
still to my brother turns with ceaseless pain
and drags at each remove a lengthening chain


eternal blessings crown my earliest friend
and round his dwelling guardian saints attend
blessd be that spot where cheerful guests retire
to pause from toil and trim their evning fire
blessd that abode where want and pain repair
and every stranger finds a ready chair
blessd be those feasts with simple plenty crownd
where all the ruddy family around
laugh at the jests or pranks that never fail
or sigh with pity at some mournful tale
or press the bashful stranger to his food
and learn the luxury of doing good


but me not destind such delights to share
my prime of life in wandring spent and care
impelld with steps unceasing to pursue
some fleeting good that mocks me with the view
that like the circle bounding earth and skies
allures from far yet as i follow flies
my fortune leads to traverse realms alone
and find no spot of all the world my own


een now where alpine solitudes ascend
i sit me down a pensive hour to spend
and placd on high above the storms career
look downward where a hundred realms appear
lakes forests cities plains extending wide
the pomp of kings the shepherds humbler pride


when thus creations charms around combine
amidst the store should thankless pride repine
say should the philosophic mind disdain
that good which makes each humbler bosom vain
let schooltaught pride dissemble all it can
these little things are great to little man
and wiser he whose sympathetic mind
exults in all the good of all mankind
ye glittring towns with wealth and splendour crownd
ye fields where summer spreads profusion round
ye lakes whose vessels catch the busy gale
ye bending swains that dress the flowry vale
for me your tributary stores combine
creations heir the world the world is mine


as some lone miser visiting his store
bends at his treasure counts recounts it oer
hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill
yet still he sighs for hoards are wanting still
thus to my breast alternate passions rise
pleasd with each good that heaven to man supplies
yet oft a sigh prevails and sorrows fall
to see the hoard of human bliss so small
and oft i wish amidst the scene to find
some spot to real happiness consignd
where my worn soul each wandring hope at rest
may gather bliss to see my fellows blessd


but where to find that happiest spot below
who can direct when all pretend to know
the shuddring tenant of the frigid zone
boldly proclaims that happiest spot his own
extols the treasures of his stormy seas
and his long nights of revelry and ease
the naked negro panting at the line
boasts of his golden sands and palmy wine
basks in the glare or stems the tepid wave
and thanks his gods for all the good they gave
such is the patriots boast whereer we roam
his first best country ever is at home
and yet perhaps if countries we compare
and estimate the blessings which they share
though patriots flatter still shall wisdom find
an equal portion dealt to all mankind
as different good by art or nature given
to different nations makes their blessings even


nature a mother kind alike to all
still grants her bliss at labours earnest call
with food as well the peasant is supplied
on idras cliffs as arnos shelvy side
and though the rockycrested summits frown
these rocks by custom turn to beds of down
from art more various are the blessings sent
wealth commerce honour liberty content
yet these each others power so strong contest
that either seems destructive of the rest
where wealth and freedom reign contentment fails
and honour sinks where commerce long prevails
hence every state to one lovd blessing prone
conforms and models life to that alone
each to the favourite happiness attends
and spurns the plan that aims at other ends
till carried to excess in each domain
this favourite good begets peculiar pain


but let us try these truths with closer eyes
and trace them through the prospect as it lies
here for a while my proper cares resignd
here let me sit in sorrow for mankind
like yon neglected shrub at random cast
that shades the steep and sighs at every blast


far to the right where apennine ascends
bright as the summer italy extends
its uplands sloping deck the mountains side
woods over woods in gay theatric pride
while oft some temples mouldring tops between
with venerable grandeur mark the scene


could natures bounty satisfy the breast
the sons of italy were surely blest
whatever fruits in different climes were found
that proudly rise or humbly court the ground
whatever blooms in torrid tracts appear
whose bright succession decks the varied year
whatever sweets salute the northern sky
with vernal lives that blossom but to die
these here disporting own the kindred soil
nor ask luxuriance from the planters toil
while seaborn gales their gelid wings expand
to winnow fragrance round the smiling land


but small the bliss that sense alone bestows
and sensual bliss is all the nation knows
in florid beauty groves and fields appear
man seems the only growth that dwindles here
contrasted faults through all his manner reign
though poor luxurious though submissive vain
though grave yet trifling zealous yet untrue
and een in penance planning sins anew
all evils here contaminate the mind
that opulence departed leaves behind
for wealth was theirs not far removd the date
when commerce proudly flourishd through the state
at her command the palace learnd to rise
again the longfalln column sought the skies
the canvas glowd beyond een nature warm
the pregnant quarry teemd with human form
till more unsteady than the southern gale
commerce on other shores displayd her sail
while nought remaind of all that riches gave
but towns unmannd and lords without a slave
and late the nation found with fruitless skill
its former strength was but plethoric ill


yet still the loss of wealth is here supplied
by arts the splendid wrecks of former pride
from these the feeble heart and longfalln mind
an easy compensation seem to find
here may be seen in bloodless pomp arrayd
the pasteboard triumph and the cavalcade
processions formd for piety and love
a mistress or a saint in every grove
by sports like these are all their cares beguild
the sports of children satisfy the child
each nobler aim repressd by long control
now sinks at last or feebly mans the soul
while low delights succeeding fast behind
in happier meanness occupy the mind
as in those domes where caesars once bore sway
defacd by time and tottering in decay
there in the ruin heedless of the dead
the shelterseeking peasant builds his shed
and wondring man could want the larger pile
exults and owns his cottage with a smile


my soul turn from them turn we to survey
where rougher climes a nobler race display
where the bleak swiss their stormy mansions tread
and force a churlish soil for scanty bread
no product here the barren hills afford
but man and steel the soldier and his sword
no vernal blooms their torpid rocks array
but winter lingring chills the lap of may
no zephyr fondly sues the mountains breast
but meteors glare and stormy glooms invest


yet still een here content can spread a charm
redress the clime and all its rage disarm
though poor the peasants hut his feasts though small
he sees his little lot the lot of all
sees no contiguous palace rear its head
to shame the meanness of his humble shed
no costly lord the sumptuous banquet deal
to make him loathe his vegetable meal
but calm and bred in ignorance and toil
each wish contracting fits him to the soil
cheerful at morn he wakes from short repose
breasts the keen air and carols as he goes
with patient angle trolls the finny deep
or drives his ventrous ploughshare to the steep
or seeks the den where snowtracks mark the way
and drags the struggling savage into day
at night returning every labour sped
he sits him down the monarch of a shed
smiles by his cheerful fire and round surveys
his childrens looks that brighten at the blaze
while his lovd partner boastful of her hoard
displays her cleanly platter on the board
and haply too some pilgrim thither led
with many a tale repays the nightly bed


thus every good his native wilds impart
imprints the patriot passion on his heart
and een those ills that round his mansion rise
enhance the bliss his scanty fund supplies
dear is that shed to which his soul conforms
and dear that hill which lifts him to the storms
and as a child when scaring sounds molest
clings close and closer to the mothers breast
so the loud torrent and the whirlwinds roar
but bind him to his native mountains more


such are the charms to barren states assignd
their wants but few their wishes all confind
yet let them only share the praises due
if few their wants their pleasures are but few
for every want that stimulates the breast
becomes a source of pleasure when redrest
whence from such lands each pleasing science flies
that first excites desire and then supplies
unknown to them when sensual pleasures cloy
to fill the languid pause with finer joy
unknown those powers that raise the soul to flame
catch every nerve and vibrate through the frame
their level life is but a smouldring fire
unquenchd by want unfannd by strong desire
unfit for raptures or if raptures cheer
on some high festival of once a year
in wild excess the vulgar breast takes fire
till buried in debauch the bliss expire


but not their joys alone thus coarsely flow
their morals like their pleasures are but low
for as refinement stops from sire to son
unalterd unimprovd the manners run
and loves and friendships finely pointed dart
fall blunted from each indurated heart
some sterner virtues oer the mountains breast
may sit like falcons cowring on the nest
but all the gentler morals such as play
through lifes more culturd walks and charm the way
these far dispersd on timorous pinions fly
to sport and flutter in a kinder sky


to kinder skies where gentler manners reign
i turn and france displays her bright domain
gay sprightly land of mirth and social ease
pleasd with thyself whom all the world can please
how often have i led thy sportive choir
with tuneless pipe beside the murmuring loire
where shading elms along the margin grew
and freshend from the wave the zephyr flew
and haply though my harsh touch faltring still
but mockd all tune and marrd the dancers skill
yet would the village praise my wondrous power
and dance forgetful of the noontide hour
alike all ages dames of ancient days
have led their children through the mirthful maze
and the gay grandsire skilld in gestic lore
has friskd beneath the burthen of threescore


so blessd a life these thoughtless realms display
thus idly busy rolls their world away
theirs are those arts that mind to mind endear
for honour forms the social temper here
honour that praise which real merit gains
or een imaginary worth obtains
here passes current paid from hand to hand
it shifts in splendid traffic round the land
from courts to camps to cottages it strays
and all are taught an avarice of praise
they please are pleasd they give to get esteem
till seeming blessd they grow to what they seem


but while this softer art their bliss supplies
it gives their follies also room to rise
for praise too dearly lovd or warmly sought
enfeebles all internal strength of thought
and the weak soul within itself unblest
leans for all pleasure on anothers breast
hence ostentation here with tawdry art
pants for the vulgar praise which fools impart
here vanity assumes her pert grimace
and trims her robes of frieze with copper lace
here beggar pride defrauds her daily cheer
to boast one splendid banquet once a year
the mind still turns where shifting fashion draws
nor weighs the solid worth of selfapplause


to men of other minds my fancy flies
embosomd in the deep where holland lies
methinks her patient sons before me stand
where the broad ocean leans against the land
and sedulous to stop the coming tide
lift the tall rampires artificial pride
onward methinks and diligently slow
the firmconnected bulwark seems to grow
spreads its long arms amidst the watry roar
scoops out an empire and usurps the shore
while the pent ocean rising oer the pile
sees an amphibious world beneath him smile
the slow canal the yellowblossomd vale
the willowtufted bank the gliding sail
the crowded mart the cultivated plain
a new creation rescud from his reign


thus while around the wavesubjected soil
impels the native to repeated toil
industrious habits in each bosom reign
and industry begets a love of gain
hence all the good from opulence that springs
with all those ills superfluous treasure brings
are here displayed their muchlovd wealth imparts
convenience plenty elegance and arts
but view them closer craft and fraud appear
een liberty itself is barterd here
at golds superior charms all freedom flies
the needy sell it and the rich man buys
a land of tyrants and a den of slaves
here wretches seek dishonourable graves
and calmly bent to servitude conform
dull as their lakes that slumber in the storm


heavens how unlike their belgic sires of old
rough poor content ungovernably bold
war in each breast and freedom on each brow
how much unlike the sons of britain now


fird at the sound my genius spreads her wing
and flies where britain courts the western spring
where lawns extend that scorn arcadian pride
and brighter streams than famd hydaspes glide
there all around the gentlest breezes stray
there gentle music melts on evry spray
creations mildest charms are there combind
extremes are only in the masters mind
stern oer each bosom reason holds her state
with daring aims irregularly great
pride in their port defiance in their eye
i see the lords of human kind pass by
intent on high designs a thoughtful band
by forms unfashiond fresh from natures hand
fierce in their native hardiness of soul
true to imagind right above control
while een the peasant boasts these rights to scan
and learns to venerate himself as man


thine freedom thine the blessings picturd here
thine are those charms that dazzle and endear
too blessd indeed were such without alloy
but fosterd een by freedom ills annoy
that independence britons prize too high
keeps man from man and breaks the social tie
the selfdependent lordlings stand alone
all claims that bind and sweeten life unknown
here by the bonds of nature feebly held
minds combat minds repelling and repelld
ferments arise imprisond factions roar
repressd ambition struggles round her shore
till overwrought the general system feels
its motions stop or frenzy fire the wheels


nor this the worst as natures ties decay
as duty love and honour fail to sway
fictitious bonds the bonds of wealth and law
still gather strength and force unwilling awe
hence all obedience bows to these alone
and talent sinks and merit weeps unknown
time may come when strippd of all her charms
the land of scholars and the nurse of arms
where noble stems transmit the patriot flame
where kings have toild and poets wrote for fame
one sink of level avarice shall lie
and scholars soldiers kings unhonourd die


yet think not thus when freedoms ills i state
i mean to flatter kings or court the great
ye powers of truth that bid my soul aspire
far from my bosom drive the low desire
and thou fair freedom taught alike to feel
the rabbles rage and tyrants angry steel
thou transitory flower alike undone
by proud contempt or favours fostering sun
still may thy blooms the changeful clime endure
i only would repress them to secure
for just experience tells in every soil
that those who think must govern those that toil
and all that freedoms highest aims can reach
is but to lay proportiond loads on each
hence should one order disproportiond grow
its double weight must ruin all below


o then how blind to all that truth requires
who think it freedom when a part aspires
calm is my soul nor apt to rise in arms
except when fastapproaching danger warms
but when contending chiefs blockade the throne
contracting regal power to stretch their own
when i behold a factious band agree
to call it freedom when themselves are free
each wanton judge new penal statutes draw
laws grind the poor and rich men rule the law
the wealth of climes where savage nations roam
pillagd from slaves to purchase slaves at home
fear pity justice indignation start
tear off reserve and bare my swelling heart
till half a patriot half a coward grown
i fly from petty tyrants to the throne


yes brother curse with me that baleful hour
when first ambition struck at regal power
and thus polluting honour in its source
gave wealth to sway the mind with double force
have we not seen round britains peopled shore
her useful sons exchangd for useless ore
seen all her triumphs but destruction haste
like flaring tapers brightning as they waste
seen opulence her grandeur to maintain
lead stern depopulation in her train
and over fields where scatterd hamlets rose
in barren solitary pomp repose
have we not seen at pleasures lordly call
the smiling longfrequented village fall
beheld the duteous son the sire decayd
the modest matron and the blushing maid
forcd from their homes a melancholy train
to traverse climes beyond the western main
where wild oswego spreads her swamps around
and niagara stuns with thundring sound


een now perhaps as there some pilgrim strays
through tangled forests and through dangerous ways
where beasts with man divided empire claim
and the brown indian marks with murdrous aim
there while above the giddy tempest flies
and all around distressful yells arise
the pensive exile bending with his woe
to stop too fearful and too faint to go
casts a long look where englands glories shine
and bids his bosom sympathise with mine


vain very vain my weary search to find
that bliss which only centres in the mind
why have i strayd from pleasure and repose
to seek a good each government bestows
in every government though terrors reign
though tyrant kings or tyrant laws restrain
how small of all that human hearts endure
that part which laws or kings can cause or cure
still to ourselves in every place consignd
our own felicity we make or find
with secret course which no loud storms annoy
glides the smooth current of domestic joy
the lifted axe the agonising wheel
lukes iron crown and damiens bed of steel
to men remote from power but rarely known
leave reason faith and conscience all our own


sweet auburn loveliest village of the plain
where health and plenty cheerd the labouring swain
where smiling spring its earliest visit paid
and parting summers lingering blooms delayd
dear lovely bowers of innocence and ease
seats of my youth when every sport could please
how often have i loiterd oer thy green
where humble happiness endeard each scene
how often have i pausd on every charm
the shelterd cot the cultivated farm
the neverfailing brook the busy mill
the decent church that toppd the neighbouring hill
the hawthorn bush with seats beneath the shade
for talking age and whispring lovers made
how often have i blessd the coming day
when toil remitting lent its turn to play
and all the village train from labour free
led up their sports beneath the spreading tree
while many a pastime circled in the shade
the young contending as the old surveyd
and many a gambol frolickd oer the ground
and sleights of art and feats of strength went round
and still as each repeated pleasure tird
succeeding sports the mirthful band inspird
the dancing pair that simply sought renown
by holding out to tire each other down
the swain mistrustless of his smutted face
while secret laughter titterd round the place
the bashful virgins sidelong looks of love
the matrons glance that would those looks reprove
these were thy charms sweet village sports like these
with sweet succession taught een toil to please
these round thy bowers their cheerful influence shed
these were thy charmsbut all these charms are fled


sweet smiling village loveliest of the lawn
thy sports are fled and all thy charms withdrawn
amidst thy bowers the tyrants hand is seen
and desolation saddens all thy green
one only master grasps the whole domain
and half a tillage stints thy smiling plain
no more thy glassy brook reflects the day
but chokd with sedges works its weedy way
along thy glades a solitary guest
the hollowsounding bittern guards its nest
amidst thy desert walks the lapwing flies
and tires their echoes with unvaried cries
sunk are thy bowers in shapeless ruin all
and the long grass oertops the mouldring wall
and trembling shrinking from the spoilers hand
far far away thy children leave the land


ill fares the land to hastning ills a prey
where wealth accumulates and men decay
princes and lords may flourish or may fade
a breath can make them as a breath has made
but a bold peasantry their countrys pride
when once destroyd can never be supplied


a time there was ere englands griefs began
when every rood of ground maintaind its man
for him light labour spread her wholesome store
just gave what life requird but gave no more
his best companions innocence and health
and his best riches ignorance of wealth


but times are alterd trades unfeeling train
usurp the land and dispossess the swain
along the lawn where scatterd hamlets rose
unwieldy wealth and cumbrous pomp repose
and every want to opulence allied
and every pang that folly pays to pride
those gentle hours that plenty bade to bloom
those calm desires that askd but little room
those healthful sports that gracd the peaceful scene
livd in each look and brightend all the green
these far departing seek a kinder shore
and rural mirth and manners are no more


sweet auburn parent of the blissful hour
thy glades forlorn confess the tyrants power
here as i take my solitary rounds
amidst thy tangling walks and ruind grounds
and many a year elapsd return to view
where once the cottage stood the hawthorn grew
remembrance wakes with all her busy train
swells at my breast and turns the past to pain


in all my wandrings round this world of care
in all my griefsand god has given my share
i still had hopes my latest hours to crown
amidst these humble bowers to lay me down
to husband out lifes taper at the close
and keep the flame from wasting by repose
i still had hopes for pride attends us still
amidst the swains to show my booklearnd skill
around my fire an evening group to draw
and tell of all i felt and all i saw
and as a hare whom hounds and horns pursue
pants to the place from whence at first she flew
i still had hopes my long vexations passd
here to returnand die at home at last


o blest retirement friend to lifes decline
retreats from care that never must be mine
how happy he who crowns in shades like these
a youth of labour with an age of ease
who quits a world where strong temptations try
and since tis hard to combat learns to fly
for him no wretches born to work and weep
explore the mine or tempt the dangerous deep
no surly porter stands in guilty state
to spurn imploring famine from the gate
but on he moves to meet his latter end
angels around befriending virtues friend
bends to the grave with unperceivd decay
while resignation gently slopes the way
and all his prospects brightning to the last
his heaven commences ere the world be passd


sweet was the sound when oft at evenings close
up yonder hill the village murmur rose
there as i passd with careless steps and slow
the mingling notes came softend from below
the swain responsive as the milkmaid sung
the sober herd that lowd to meet their young
the noisy geese that gabbled oer the pool
the playful children just let loose from school
the watchdogs voice that bayd the whispring wind
and the loud laugh that spoke the vacant mind
these all in sweet confusion sought the shade
and filld each pause the nightingale had made
but now the sounds of population fail
no cheerful murmurs fluctuate in the gale
no busy steps the grassgrown footway tread
for all the bloomy flush of life is fled
all but yon widowd solitary thing
that feebly bends beside the plashy spring
she wretched matron forcd in age for bread
to strip the brook with mantling cresses spread
to pick her wintry faggot from the thorn
to seek her nightly shed and weep till morn
she only left of all the harmless train
the sad historian of the pensive plain


near yonder copse where once the garden smild
and still where many a garden flower grows wild
there where a few torn shrubs the place disclose
the village preachers modest mansion rose
a man he was to all the country dear
and passing rich with forty pounds a year
remote from towns he ran his godly race
nor eer had changd nor wished to change his place
unpractisd he to fawn or seek for power
by doctrines fashiond to the varying hour
far other aims his heart had learned to prize
more skilld to raise the wretched than to rise
his house was known to all the vagrant train
he chid their wandrings but relievd their pain
the longrememberd beggar was his guest
whose beard descending swept his aged breast
the ruind spendthrift now no longer proud
claimd kindred there and had his claims allowd
the broken soldier kindly bade to stay
sat by his fire and talkd the night away
wept oer his wounds or tales of sorrow done
shoulderd his crutch and showd how fields were won
pleasd with his guests the good man learnd to glow
and quite forgot their vices in their woe
careless their merits or their faults to scan
his pity gave ere charity began


thus to relieve the wretched was his pride
and een his failings leand to virtues side
but in his duty prompt at every call
he watchd and wept he prayd and felt for all
and as a bird each fond endearment tries
to tempt its newfledgd offspring to the skies
he tried each art reprovd each dull delay
allurd to brighter worlds and led the way


beside the bed where parting life was laid
and sorrow guilt and pain by turns dismayd
the reverend champion stood at his control
despair and anguish fled the struggling soul
comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise
and his last faltring accents whisperd praise


at church with meek and unaffected grace
his looks adornd the venerable place
truth from his lips prevaild with double sway
and fools who came to scoff remaind to pray
the service passd around the pious man
with steady zeal each honest rustic ran
even children followd with endearing wile
and pluckd his gown to share the good mans smile
his ready smile a parents warmth expressd
their welfare pleasd him and their cares distressd
to them his heart his love his griefs were given
but all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven
as some tall cliff that lifts its awful form
swells from the vale and midway leaves the storm
though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread
eternal sunshine settles on its head


beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way
with blossomd furze unprofitably gay
there in his noisy mansion skilld to rule
the village master taught his little school
a man severe he was and stern to view
i knew him well and every truant knew
well had the boding tremblers learnd to trace
the days disasters in his morning face
full well they laughd with counterfeited glee
at all his jokes for many a joke had he
full well the busy whisper circling round
conveyd the dismal tidings when he frownd
yet he was kind or if severe in aught
the love he bore to learning was in fault
the village all declard how much he knew
twas certain he could write and cypher too
lands he could measure terms and tides presage
and een the story ran that he could gauge
in arguing too the parson ownd his skill
for een though vanquishd he could argue still
while words of learned length and thundring sound
amazed the gazing rustics rangd around
and still they gazd and still the wonder grew
that one small head could carry all he knew


but past is all his fame the very spot
where many a time he triumphd is forgot
near yonder thorn that lifts its head on high
where once the signpost caught the passing eye
low lies that house where nutbrown draughts inspird
where greybeard mirth and smiling toil retird
where village statesmen talkd with looks profound
and news much older than their ale went round
imagination fondly stoops to trace
the parlour splendours of that festive place
the whitewashd wall the nicely sanded floor
the varnishd clock that clickd behind the door
the chest contrivd a double debt to pay
a bed by night a chest of drawers by day
the pictures placd for ornament and use
the twelve good rules the royal game of goose
the hearth except when winter chilld the day
with aspen boughs and flowers and fennel gay
while broken teacups wisely kept for show
rangd oer the chimney glistend in a row


vain transitory splendours could not all
reprieve the tottering mansion from its fall
obscure it sinks nor shall it more impart
an hours importance to the poor mans heart
thither no more the peasant shall repair
to sweet oblivion of his daily care
no more the farmers news the barbers tale
no more the woodmans ballad shall prevail
no more the smith his dusky brown shall clear
relax his pondrous strength and lean to hear
the host himself no longer shall be found
careful to see the mantling bliss go round
nor the coy maid half willing to be pressd
shall kiss the cup to pass it to the rest


yes let the rich deride the proud disdain
these simple blessings of the lowly train
to me more dear congenial to my heart
one native charm than all the gloss of art
spontaneous joys where nature has its play
the soul adopts and owns their firstborn sway
lightly they frolic oer the vacant mind
unenvied unmolested unconfind
but the long pomp the midnight masquerade
with all the freaks of wanton wealth arrayd
in these ere triflers half their wish obtain
the toiling pleasure sickens into pain
and een while fashions brightest arts decoy
the heart distrusting asks if this be joy


ye friends to truth ye statesmen who survey
the rich mans joys increase the poors decay
tis yours to judge how wide the limits stand
between a splendid and a happy land
proud swells the tide with loads of freighted ore
and shouting folly hails them from her shore
hoards een beyond the misers wish abound
and rich men flock from all the world around
yet count our gains this wealth is but a name
that leaves our useful products still the same
nor so the loss the man of wealth and pride
takes up a space that many poor supplied
space for his lake his parks extended bounds
space for his horses equipage and hounds
the robe that wraps his limbs in silken sloth
has robbd the neighbouring fields of half their growth
his seat where solitary sports are seen
indignant spurns the cottage from the green
around the world each needful product flies
for all the luxuries the world supplies
while thus the land adornd for pleasure all
in barren splendour feebly waits the fall


as some fair female unadornd and plain
secure to please while youth confirms her reign
slights every borrowd charm that dress supplies
nor shares with art the triumph of her eyes
but when those charms are passd for charms are frail
when time advances and when lovers fail
she then shines forth solicitous to bless
in all the glaring impotence of dress
thus fares the land by luxury betrayd
in natures simplest charms at first arrayd
but verging to decline its splendours rise
its vistas strike its palaces surprise
while scourgd by famine from the smiling land
the mournful peasant leads his humble band
and while he sinks without one arm to save
the country bloomsa garden and a grave


where then ah where shall poverty reside
to scape the pressure of continuous pride
if to some commons fenceless limits strayd
he drives his flock to pick the scanty blade
those fenceless fields the sons of wealth divide
and een the bareworn common is denied


if to the city spedwhat waits him there
to see profusion that he must not share
to see ten thousand baneful arts combind
to pamper luxury and thin mankind
to see those joys the sons of pleasure know
extorted from his fellow creatures woe
here while the courtier glitters in brocade
there the pale artist plies the sickly trade
here while the proud their longdrawn pomps display
there the black gibbet glooms beside the way
the dome where pleasure holds her midnight reign
here richly deckd admits the gorgeous train
tumultuous grandeur crowds the blazing square
the rattling chariots clash the torches glare
sure scenes like these no troubles eer annoy
sure these denote one universal joy
are these thy serious thoughtsah turn thine eyes
where the poor houseless shivring female lies
she once perhaps in village plenty blessd
has wept at tales of innocence distressd
her modest looks the cottage might adorn
sweet as the primrose peeps beneath the thorn
now lost to all her friends her virtue fled
near her betrayers door she lays her head
and pinchd with cold and shrinking from the shower
with heavy heart deplores that luckless hour
when idly first ambitious of the town
she left her wheel and robes of country brown


do thine sweet auburn thine the loveliest train
do thy fair tribes participate her pain
een now perhaps by cold and hunger led
at proud mens doors they ask a little bread


ah no to distant climes a dreary scene
where half the convex world intrudes between
through torrid tracts with fainting steps they go
where wild altama murmurs to their woe
far different there from all that charmd before
the various terrors of that horrid shore
those blazing suns that dart a downward ray
and fiercely shed intolerable day
those matted woods where birds forget to sing
but silent bats in drowsy clusters cling
those poisnous fields with rank luxuriance crownd
where the dark scorpion gathers death around
where at each step the stranger fears to wake
the rattling terrors of the vengeful snake
where crouching tigers wait their hapless prey
and savage men more murdrous still than they
while oft in whirls the mad tornado flies
mingling the ravagd landscape with the skies
far different these from every former scene
the cooling brook the grassyvested green
the breezy covert of the warbling grove
that only shelterd thefts of harmless love


good heaven what sorrows gloomd that parting day
that calld them from their native walks away
when the poor exiles every pleasure passd
hung round their bowers and fondly lookd their last
and took a long farewell and wishd in vain
for seats like these beyond the western main
and shuddring still to face the distant deep
returnd and wept and still returnd to weep
the good old sire the first prepard to go
to newfound worlds and wept for others woe
but for himself in conscious virtue brave
he only wishd for worlds beyond the grave
his lovely daughter lovlier in her tears
the fond companion of his helpless years
silent went next neglectful of her charms
and left a lovers for a fathers arms
with louder plaints the mother spoke her woes
and blessd the cot where every pleasure rose
and kissd her thoughtless babes with many a tear
and claspd them close in sorrow doubly dear
whilst her fond husband strove to lend relief
in all the silent manliness of grief


o luxury thou cursd by heavens decree
how ill exchangd are things like these for thee
how do thy potions with insidious joy
diffuse their pleasures only to destroy
kingdoms by thee to sickly greatness grown
boast of a florid vigour not their own
at every draught more large and large they grow
a bloated mass of rank unwieldy woe
till sappd their strength and every part unsound
down down they sink and spread a ruin round


een now the devastation is begun
and half the business of destruction done
een now methinks as pondring here i stand
i see the rural virtues leave the land
down where yon anchoring vessel spreads the sail
that idly waiting flaps with evry gale
downward they move a melancholy band
pass from the shore and darken all the strand
contented toil and hospitable care
and kind connubial tenderness are there
and piety with wishes placd above
and steady loyalty and faithful love
and thou sweet poetry thou loveliest maid
still first to fly where sensual joys invade
unfit in these degenerate times of shame
to catch the heart or strike for honest fame
dear charming nymph neglected and decried
my shame in crowds my solitary pride
thou source of all my bliss and all my woe
that foundst me poor at first and keepst me so
thou guide by which the nobler arts excel
thou nurse of every virtue fare thee well
farewell and oh whereer thy voice be tried
on tornos cliffs or pambamarcas side
whether where equinoctial fervours glow
or winter wraps the polar world in snow
still let thy voice prevailing over time
redress the rigours of th inclement clime
aid slighted truth with thy persuasive strain
teach erring man to spurn the rage of gain
teach him that states of native strength possessd
though very poor may still be very blessd
that trades proud empire hastes to swift decay
as ocean sweeps the labourd mole away
while selfdependent power can time defy
as rocks resist the billows and the sky


what no way left to shun th inglorious stage
and save from infamy my sinking age
scarce half alive oppressd with many a year
what in the name of dotage drives me here
a time there was when glory was my guide
nor force nor fraud could turn my steps aside
unawd by powr and unappalld by fear
with honest thrift i held my honour dear
but this vile hour disperses all my store
and all my hoard of honour is no more


for ah too partial to my lifes decline
caesar persuades submission must be mine
him i obey whom heaven itself obeys
hopeless of pleasing yet inclind to please
here then at once i welcome every shame
and cancel at threescore a life of fame
no more my titles shall my children tell
the old buffoon will fit my name as well
this day beyond its term my fate extends
for life is ended when our honour ends


say cruel iris pretty rake
dear mercenary beauty
what annual offering shall i make
expressive of my duty


my heart a victim to thine eyes
should i at once deliver
say would the angry fair one prize
the gift who slights the giver


a bill a jewel watch or toy
my rivals giveand let em
if gems or gold impart a joy
ill give themwhen i get em


ill givebut not the fullblown rose
or rosebud more in fashion
such shortlivd offerings but disclose
a transitory passion


ill give thee something yet unpaid
not less sincere than civil
ill give theeah too charming maid
ill give theeto the devil


logicians have but ill defind
as rational the human kind
reason they say belongs to man
but let them prove it if they can
wise aristotle and smiglecius
by ratiocinations specious
have strove to prove with great precision
with definition and division
homo est ratione praeditum
but for my soul i cannot credit em
and must in spite of them maintain
that man and all his ways are vain
and that this boasted lord of nature
is both a weak and erring creature
that instinct is a surer guide
than reasonboasting mortals pride
and that brute beasts are far before em
deus est anima brutorum
who ever knew an honest brute
at law his neighbour prosecute
bring action for assault and battery
or friend beguile with lies and flattery
oer plains they ramble unconfind
no politics disturb their mind
they eat their meals and take their sport
nor know whos in or out at court
they never to the levee go
to treat as dearest friend a foe
they never importune his grace
nor ever cringe to men in place
nor undertake a dirty job
nor draw the quill to write for bb
fraught with invective they neer go
to folks at paternosterrow
no judges fiddlers dancingmasters
no pickpockets or poetasters
are known to honest quadrupeds
no single brute his fellow leads
brutes never meet in bloody fray
nor cut each others throats for pay
of beasts it is confessd the ape
comes nearest us in human shape
like man he imitates each fashion
and malice is his ruling passion
but both in malice and grimaces
a courtier any ape surpasses
behold him humbly cringing wait
upon a minister of state
view him soon after to inferiors
aping the conduct of superiors
he promises with equal air
and to perform takes equal care
he in his turn finds imitators
at court the porters lacqueys waiters
their masters manners still contract
and footmen lords and dukes can act
thus at the court both great an small
behave alikefor all ape all


weeping murmuring complaining
lost to every gay delight
myra too sincere for feigning
fears th approaching bridal night


yet why impair thy bright perfection
or dim thy beauty with a tear
had myra followed my direction
she long had wanted cause of fear


amidst the clamour of exulting joys
which triumph forces from the patriot heart
grief dares to mingle her soulpiercing voice
and quells the raptures which from pleasures start


o wolfe to thee a streaming flood of woe
sighing we pay and think een conquest dear
quebec in vain shall teach our breast to glow
whilst thy sad fate extorts the heartwrung tear


alive the foe thy dreadful vigour fled
and saw thee fall with joypronouncing eyes
yet they shall know thou conquerest though dead
since from thy tomb a thousand heroes rise


good people all with one accord
lament for madam blaize
who never wanted a good word
from those who spoke her praise


the needy seldom passd her door
and always found her kind
she freely lent to all the poor
who left a pledge behind


she strove the neighbourhood to please
with manners wondrous winning
and never followd wicked ways
unless when she was sinning


at church in silks and satins new
with hoop of monstrous size
she never slumberd in her pew
but when she shut her eyes


her love was sought i do aver
by twenty beaux and more
the king himself has followd her
when she has walkd before


but now her wealth and finery fled
her hangerson cut short all
the doctors found when she was dead
her last disorder mortal


let us lament in sorrow sore
for kentstreet well may say
that had she livd a twelvemonth more
she had not died today


where the red lion flaring oer the way
invites each passing stranger that can pay
where calverts butt and parsons black champagne
regale the drabs and bloods of drurylane
there in a lonely room from bailiffs snug
the muse found scroggen stretchd beneath a rug
a window patchd with paper lent a ray
that dimly showd the state in which he lay
the sanded floor that grits beneath the tread
the humid wall with paltry pictures spread
the royal game of goose was there in view
and the twelve rules the royal martyr drew
the seasons framd with listing found a place
and brave prince william showd his lampblack face
the morn was cold he views with keen desire
the rusty grate unconscious of a fire
with beer and milk arrears the frieze was scord
and five crackd teacups dressd the chimney board
a nightcap deckd his brows instead of bay
a cap by nighta stocking all the day


for you bright fair the nine address their lays
and tune my feeble voice to sing thy praise
the heartfelt power of every charm divine
who can withstand their allcommanding shine
see how she moves along with every grace
while soulbrought tears steal down each shining face
she speaks tis rapture all and nameless bliss
ye gods what transport eer compared to this
as when in paphian groves the queen of love
with fond complaint addressed the listening jove
twas joy and endless blisses all around
and rocks forgot their hardness at the sound
then first at last even jove was taken in
and felt her charms without disguise within


ye muses pour the pitying tear
for pollio snatchd away
o had he livd another year
he had not died today


o were he born to bless mankind
in virtuous times of yore
heroes themselves had fallen behind
wheneer he went before


how sad the groves and plains appear
and sympathetic sheep
even pitying hills would drop a tear
if hills could learn to weep


his bounty in exalted strain
each bard might well display
since none implord relief in vain
that went relievd away


and hark i hear the tuneful throng
his obsequies forbid
he still shall live shall live as long
as ever dead man did


let not the hungry bavius angry stroke
awake resentment or your rage provoke
but pitying his distress let virtue shine
and giving each your bounty let him dine
for thus retaind as learned counsel can
each case however bad hell new japan
and by a quick transition plainly show
twas no defect of yours but pocket low
that caused his putrid kennel to oerflow


twas you or i or he or all together
twas one both three of them they know not whether
this i believe between us great or small
you i he wrote it nottwas churchills all


in all my ennas beauties blest
amidst profusion still i pine
for though she gives me up her breast
its panting tenant is not mine


secluded from domestic strife
jack bookworm led a college life
a fellowship at twentyfive
made him the happiest man alive
he drank his glass and crackd his joke
and freshmen wonderd as he spoke


such pleasures unalloyd with care
could any accident impair
could cupids shaft at length transfix
our swain arrivd at thirtysix
o had the archer neer come down
to ravage in a country town
or flavia been content to stop
at triumphs in a fleetstreet shop


o had her eyes forgot to blaze
or jack had wanted eyes to gaze
o but let exclamation cease
her presence banishd all his peace
so with decorum all things carried
miss frownd and blushd and then was married


need we expose to vulgar sight
the raptures of the bridal night
need we intrude on hallowd ground
or draw the curtains closd around


let it suffice that each had charms
he claspd a goddess in his arms
and though she felt his usage rough
yet in a man twas well enough


the honeymoon like lightning flew
the second brought its transports too
a third a fourth were not amiss
the fifth was friendship mixd with bliss
but when a twelvemonth passd away
jack found his goddess made of clay


found half the charms that deckd her face
arose from powder shreds or lace
but still the worst remaind behind
that very face had robbd her mind


skilld in no other arts was she
but dressing patching repartee
and just as humour rose or fell
by turns a slattern or a belle
tis true she dressd with modern grace
half naked at a ball or race
but when at home at board or bed
five greasy nightcaps wrappd her head


could so much beauty condescend
to be a dull domestic friend
could any curtainlectures bring
to decency so fine a thing
in short by night twas fits or fretting
by day twas gadding or coquetting
fond to be seen she kept a bevy
of powderd coxcombs at her levy
the squire and captain took their stations
and twenty other near relations


jack suckd his pipe and often broke
a sigh in suffocating smoke
while all their hours were passd between
insulting repartee or spleen


thus as her faults each day were known
he thinks her features coarser grown
he fancies every vice she shows
or thins her lip or points her nose
whenever rage or envy rise
how wide her mouth how wild her eyes
he knows not how but so it is
her face is grown a knowing phiz
and though her fops are wondrous civil
he thinks her ugly as the devil


now to perplex the ravelld noose
as each a different way pursues
while sullen or loquacious strife
promisd to hold them on for life
that dire disease whose ruthless power
withers the beautys transient flower
lo the smallpox whose horrid glare
levelld its terrors at the fair
and rifling evry youthful grace
left but the remnant of a face


the glass grown hateful to her sight
reflected now a perfect fright
each former art she vainly tries
to bring back lustre to her eyes
in vain she tries her paste and creams
to smooth her skin or hide its seams
her country beaux and city cousins
lovers no more flew off by dozens
the squire himself was seen to yield
and een the captain quit the field


poor madam now condemnd to hack
the rest of life with anxious jack
perceiving others fairly flown
attempted pleasing him alone
jack soon was dazzld to behold
her present face surpass the old
with modesty her cheeks are dyd
humility displaces pride
for tawdry finery is seen
a person ever neatly clean
no more presuming on her sway
she learns goodnature every day
serenely gay and strict in duty
jack finds his wife a perfect beauty


long had i sought in vain to find
a likeness for the scribbling kind
the modern scribbling kind who write
in wit and sense and natures spite
till reading i forget what day on
a chapter out of tookes pantheon
i think i met with something there
to suit my purpose to a hair


but let us not proceed too furious
first please to turn to god mercurius
youll find him picturd at full length
in book the second page the tenth
the stress of all my proofs on him i lay
and now proceed we to our simile


imprimis pray observe his hat
wings upon either sidemark that
well what is it from thence we gather
why these denote a brain of feather
a brain of feather very right
with wit thats flighty learning light
such as to modern bards decreed
a just comparisonproceed


in the next place his feet peruse
wings grow again from both his shoes
designd no doubt their part to bear
and waft his godship through the air
and here my simile unites
for in a modern poets flights
im sure it may be justly said
his feet are useful as his head


lastly vouchsafe tobserve his hand
filled with a snakeencircld wand
by classic authors termd caduceus
and highly famd for several uses
to witmost wondrously endud
no poppy water half so good
for let folks only get a touch
its soporific virtues such
though neer so much awake before
that quickly they begin to snore
add too what certain writers tell
with this he drives mens souls to hell


now to apply begin we then
his wands a modern authors pen
the serpents round about it twind
denote him of the reptile kind
denote the rage with which he writes
his frothy slaver venomd bites
an equal semblance still to keep
alike too both conduce to sleep
this diffrence only as the god
drove souls to tartrus with his rod
with his goosequill the scribbling elf
instead of others damns himself


and here my simile almost tript
yet grant a word by way of postscript
moreover mercry had a failing
well what of that out with itstealing
in which all modern bards agree
being each as great a thief as he
but evn this deitys existence
shall lend my simile assistance
our modern bards why what a pox
are they but senseless stones and blocks


turn gentle hermit of the dale
and guide my lonely way
to where yon taper cheers the vale
with hospitable ray


for here forlorn and lost i tread
with fainting steps and slow
where wilds immeasurably spread
seem lengthning as i go


forbear my son the hermit cries
to tempt the dangerous gloom
for yonder faithless phantom flies
to lure thee to thy doom


here to the houseless child of want
my door is open still
and though my portion is but scant
i give it with good will


then turn tonight and freely share
whateer my cell bestows
my rushy couch and frugal fare
my blessing and repose


no flocks that range the valley free
to slaughter i condemn
taught by that power that pities me
i learn to pity them


but from the mountains grassy side
a guiltless feast i bring
a scrip with herbs and fruits supplied
and water from the spring


then pilgrim turn thy cares forgo
all earthborn cares are wrong
man wants but little here below
nor wants that little long


soft as the dew from heavn descends
his gentle accents fell
the modest stranger lowly bends
and follows to the cell


far in a wilderness obscure
the lonely mansion lay
a refuge to the neighbouring poor
and strangers led astray


no stores beneath its humble thatch
requird a masters care
the wicket opening with a latch
receivd the harmless pair


and now when busy crowds retire
to take their evening rest
the hermit trimmd his little fire
and cheerd his pensive guest


and spread his vegetable store
and gaily pressd and smild
and skilld in legendary lore
the lingering hours beguild


around in sympathetic mirth
its tricks the kitten tries
the cricket chirrups in the hearth
the crackling faggot flies


but nothing could a charm impart
to soothe the strangers woe
for grief was heavy at his heart
and tears began to flow


his rising cares the hermit spied
with answring care oppressd
and whence unhappy youth he cried
the sorrows of thy breast


from better habitations spurnd
reluctant dost thou rove
or grieve for friendship unreturnd
or unregarded love


alas the joys that fortune brings
are trifling and decay
and those who prize the paltry things
more trifling still than they


and what is friendship but a name
a charm that lulls to sleep
a shade that follows wealth or fame
but leaves the wretch to weep


and love is still an emptier sound
the modern fair ones jest
on earth unseen or only found
to warm the turtles nest


for shame fond youth thy sorrows hush
and spurn the sex he said
but while he spoke a rising blush
his lovelorn guest betrayd


surprisd he sees new beauties rise
swift mantling to the view
like colours oer the morning skies
as bright as transient too


the bashful look the rising breast
alternate spread alarms
the lovely stranger stands confessd
a maid in all her charms


and ah forgive a stranger rude
a wretch forlorn she cried
whose feet unhallowd thus intrude
where heaven and you reside


but let a maid thy pity share
whom love has taught to stray
who seeks for rest but finds despair
companion of her way


my father livd beside the tyne
a wealthy lord was he
and all his wealth was markd as mine
he had but only me


to win me from his tender arms
unnumberd suitors came
who praisd me for imputed charms
and felt or feignd a flame


each hour a mercenary crowd
with richest proffers strove
amongst the rest young edwin bowd
but never talkd of love


in humble simplest habit clad
no wealth nor power had he
wisdom and worth were all he had
but these were all to me


and when beside me in the dale
he carolld lays of love
his breath lent fragrance to the gale
and music to the grove


the blossom opening to the day
the dews of heaven refind
could nought of purity display
to emulate his mind


the dew the blossom on the tree
with charms inconstant shine
their charms were his but woe to me
their constancy was mine


for still i tried each fickle art
importunate and vain
and while his passion touchd my heart
i triumphd in his pain


till quite dejected with my scorn
he left me to my pride
and sought a solitude forlorn
in secret where he died


but mine the sorrow mine the fault
and well my life shall pay
ill seek the solitude he sought
and stretch me where he lay


and there forlorn despairing hid
ill lay me down and die
twas so for me that edwin did
and so for him will i


forbid it heaven the hermit cried
and claspd her to his breast
the wondering fair one turnd to chide
twas edwins self that prest


turn angelina ever dear
my charmer turn to see
thy own thy longlost edwin here
restord to love and thee


thus let me hold thee to my heart
and evry care resign
and shall we never never part
my life my all thats mine


no never from this hour to part
well live and love so true
the sigh that rends thy constant heart
shall break thy edwins too


good people all of every sort
give ear unto my song
and if you find it wondrous short
it cannot hold you long


in islington there was a man
of whom the world might say
that still a godly race he ran
wheneer he went to pray


a kind and gentle heart he had
to comfort friends and foes
the naked every day he clad
when he put on his clothes


and in that town a dog was found
as many dogs there be
both mongrel puppy whelp and hound
and curs of low degree


this dog and man at first were friends
but when a pique began
the dog to gain some private ends
went mad and bit the man


around from all the neighbouring streets
the wondring neighbours ran
and swore the dog had lost his wits
to bite so good a man


the wound it seemd both sore and sad
to every christian eye
and while they swore the dog was mad
they swore the man would die


but soon a wonder came to light
that showd the rogues they lied
the man recoverd of the bite
the dog it was that died


when lovely woman stoops to folly
and finds too late that men betray
what charm can soothe her melancholy
what art can wash her guilt away


the only art her guilt to cover
to hide her shame from every eye
to give repentance to her lover
and wring his bosom is to die


as puffing quacks some caitiff wretch procure
to swear the pill or drop has wrought a cure
thus on the stage our playwrights still depend
for epilogues and prologues on some friend
who knows each art of coaxing up the town
and make full many a bitter pill go down
conscious of this our bard has gone about
and teasd each rhyming friend to help him out
an epilogue things cant go on without it
it could not fail would you but set about it
young man cries one a bard laid up in clover
alas young man my writing days are over


let boys play tricks and kick the straw not i
your brother doctor there perhaps may try
what i dear sir the doctor interposes
what plant my thistle sir among his roses
no no ive other contests to maintain
tonight i head our troops at warwick lane
go ask your manager who me your pardon
those things are not our forte at covent garden
our authors friends thus placd at happy distance
give him good words indeed but no assistance


as some unhappy wight at some new play
at the pit door stands elbowing a way
while oft with many a smile and many a shrug
he eyes the centre where his friends sit snug
his simpring friends with pleasure in their eyes
sink as he sinks and as he rises rise
he nods they nod he cringes they grimace
but not a soul will budge to give him place
since then unhelpd our bard must now conform
to bide the pelting of this pitiless storm
blame where you must be candid where you can
and be each critic the good naturd man


what five long acts and all to make us wiser
our authoress sure has wanted an adviser
had she consulted me she should have made
her moral play a speaking masquerade
warmd up each bustling scene and in her rage
have emptied all the greenroom on the stage
my life ont this had kept her play from sinking
have pleasd our eyes and savd the pain of thinking
well since she thus has shown her want of skill
what if i give a masquerade i will


statesmen with bridles on and close beside em
patriots in partycoloured suits that ride em
there hebes turnd of fifty try once more
to raise a flame in cupids of threescore
these in their turn with appetites as keen
deserting fifty fasten on fifteen


miss not yet full fifteen with fire uncommon
flings down her sampler and takes up the woman
the little urchin smiles and spreads her lure
and tries to kill ere shes got power to cure
thus tis with all their chief and constant care
is to seem everything but what they are
yon broad bold angry spark i fix my eye on
who seems to have robbd his vizor from the lion
who frowns and talks and swears with round parade
looking as who should say d__ __ whos afraid


strip but his vizor off and sure i am
youll find his lionship a very lamb
yon politician famous in debate
perhaps to vulgar eyes bestrides the state
yet when he deigns his real shape t assume
he turns old woman and bestrides a broom
yon patriot too who presses on your sight
and seems to every gazer all in white
if with a bribe his candour you attack
he bows turns round and whip the mans a black
yon critic too but whither do i run
if i proceed our bard will be undone
well then a truce since she requests it too
do you spare her and ill for once spare you


in these bold times when learnings sons explore
the distant climate and the savage shore
when wise astronomers to india steer
and quit for venus many a brighter here
while botanists all cold to smiles and dimpling
forsake the fair and patiently go simpling
when every bosom swells with wondrous scenes
priests cannibals and hoitytoity queens
our bard into the general spirit enters
and fits his little frigate for adventures


with scythian stores and trinkets deeply laden
he this way steers his course in hopes of trading
yet ere he lands he as ordered me before
to make an observation on the shore
where are we driven our reckning sure is lost
this seems a barren and a dangerous coast


the place is uninhabited i fear
i heard a hissing there are serpents here
o there the natives are a dreadful race
the men have tails the women paint the face
no doubt theyre all barbarians yes tis so
ill try to make palaver with them though


tis best however keeping at a distance
good savages our captain craves assistance
our ships well stord in yonder creek weve laid her
his honour is no mercenary trader
this is his first adventure lend him aid
or you may chance to spoil a thriving trade
his goods he hopes are prime and brought from far
equally fit for gallantry and war
what no reply to promises so ample
id best step back and order up a sample


arise ye sons of worth arise
and waken every note of woe
when truth and virtue reach the skies
tis ours to weep the want below


let schoolmasters puzzle their brain
with grammar and nonsense and learning
good liquor i stoutly maintain
gives genus a better discerning
let them brag of their heathenish gods
their lethes their styxes and stygians
their quis and their quaes and their quods
theyre all but a parcel of pigeons
toroddle toroddle toroll


when methodist preachers come down
apreaching that drinking is sinful
ill wager the rascals a crown
they always preach best with a skinful
but when you come down with your pence
for a slice of their scurvy religion
ill leave it to all men of sense
but you my good friend are the pigeon
toroddle toroddle toroll


then come put the jorum about
and let us be merry and clever
our hearts and our liquors are stout
heres the three jolly pigeons for ever
let some cry up woodcock or hare
your bustards your ducks and your widgeons
but of all the birds in the air
heres a health to the three jolly pigeons
toroddle toroddle toroll


well having stoopd to conquer with success
and gaind a husband without aid from dress
still as a barmaid i could wish it too
as i have conquerd him to conquer you
and let me say for all your resolution
that pretty barmaids have done execution
our life is all a play composd to please
we have our exits and our entrances
the first act shows the simple country maid
harmless and young of evry thing afraid
blushes when hird and with unmeaning action
i hopes as how to give you satisfaction
her second act displays a livelier scene
th unblushing barmaid of a country inn
who whisks about the house at market caters
talks loud coquets the guests and scolds the waiters
next the scene shifts to town and there she soars
the chophouse toast of ogling connoisseurs
on squires and cits she there displays her arts
and on the gridiron broils her lovers hearts
and as she smiles her triumphs to complete
even commoncouncilmen forget to eat
the fourth act shows her wedded to the squire
and madam now begins to hold it higher
pretends to taste at operas cries caro
and quits her nancy dawson for che faro
doats upon dancing and in all her pride
swims round the room the heinel of cheapside
ogles and leers with artificial skill
till having lost in age the power to kill
she sits all night at cards and ogles at spadille
such through our lives the eventful history
the fifth and last act still remains for me
the barmaid now for your protection prays
turns female barrister and pleads for bayes


of old when scarron his companions invited
each guest brought his dish and the feast was united
if our landlord supplies us with beef and with fish
let each guest bring himself and he brings the best dish
our dean shall be venison just fresh from the plains
our burke shall be tongue with a garnish of brains
our will shall be wildfowl of excellent flavour
and dick with his pepper shall heighten their savour
our cumberlands sweetbread its place shall obtain
and douglas is pudding substantial and plain
our garricks a salad for in him we see
oil vinegar sugar and saltness agree
to make out the dinner full certain i am
that ridge is anchovy and reynolds is lamb


that hickeys a capon and by the same rule
magnanimous goldsmith a gooseberry fool
at a dinner so various at such a repast
whod not be a glutton and stick to the last
here waiter more wine let me sit while im able
till all my companions sink under the table
then with chaos and blunders encircling my head
let me ponder and tell what i think of the dead


here lies the good dean reunited to earth
who mixd reason with pleasure and wisdom with mirth
if he had any faults he has left us in doubt
at least in six weeks i could not find em out
yet some have declard and it cant be denied em
that slyboots was cursedly cunning to hide em


here lies our good edmund whose genius was such
we scarcely can praise it or blame it too much
who born for the universe narrowd his mind
and to party gave up what was meant for mankind
though fraught with all learning yet straining his throat
to persuade tommy townshend to lend him a vote
who too deep for his hearers still went on refining
and thought of convincing while they thought of dining
though equal to all things for all things unfit
too nice for a statesman too proud for a wit


for a patriot too cool for a drudge disobedient
and too fond of the right to pursue the expedient
in short twas his fate unemployd or in place sir
to eat mutton cold and cut blocks with a razor


here lies honest william whose heart was a mint
while the owner neer knew half the good that was int
the pupil of impulse it forcd him along
his conduct still right with his argument wrong
still aiming at honour yet fearing to roam
the coachman was tipsy the chariot drove home
would you ask for his merits alas he had none
what was good was spontaneous his faults were his own


here lies honest richard whose fate i must sigh at
alas that such frolic should now be so quiet
what spirits were his what wit and what whim
now breaking a jest and now breaking a limb
now wrangling and grumbling to keep up the ball
now teasing and vexing yet laughing at all
in short so provoking a devil was dick
that we wishd him full ten times a day at old nick
but missing his mirth and agreeable vein
as often we wishd to have dick back again


here cumberland lies having acted his parts
the terence of england the mender of hearts
a flattering painter who made it his care
to draw men as they ought to be not as they are
his gallants are all faultless his women divine
and comedy wonders at being so fine
like a tragedy queen he has dizend her out
or rather like tragedy giving a rout
his fools have their follies so lost in a crowd
of virtues and feelings that folly grows proud


and coxcombs alike in their failings alone
adopting his portraits are pleasd with their own
say where has our poet this malady caught
or wherefore his characters thus without fault
say was it that vainly directing his view
to find out mens virtues and finding them few
quite sick of pursuing each troublesome elf
he grew lazy at last and drew from himself


here douglas retires from his toils to relax
the scourge of impostors the terror of quacks
come all ye quack bards and ye quacking divines
come and dance on the spot where your tyrant reclines
when satire and censure encircld his throne
i feard for your safety i feard for my own
but now he is gone and we want a detector
our dodds shall be pious our kenricks shall lecture
macpherson write bombast and call it a style
our townshend make speeches and i shall compile


new lauders and bowers the tweed shall cross over
no countryman living their tricks to discover
detection her taper shall quench to a spark
and scotchman meet scotchman and cheat in the dark


here lies david garrick describe me who can
an abridgment of all that was pleasant in man
as an actor confessd without rival to shine
as a wit if not first in the very first line
yet with talents like these and an excellent heart
the man had his failings a dupe to his art
like an illjudging beauty his colours he spread
and beplasterd with rouge his own natural red
on the stage he was natural simple affecting
twas only that when he was off he was acting
with no reason on earth to go out of his way
he turnd and he varied full ten times a day


though secure of our hearts yet confoundedly sick
if they were not his own by finessing and trick
he cast off his friends as a huntsman his pack
for he knew when he pleasd he could whistle them back
of praise a mere glutton he swallowd what came
and the puff of a dunce he mistook it for fame
till his relish grown callous almost to disease
who pepperd the highest was surest to please
but let us be candid and speak out our mind
if dunces applauded he paid them in kind
ye kenricks ye kellys and woodfalls so grave
what a commerce was yours while you got and you gave
how did grubstreet reecho the shouts you raisd
while he was berosciusd and you were bepraisd


but peace to his spirit wherever it flies
to act as an angel and mix with the skies
those poets who owe their best fame to his skill
shall still be his flatterers go where he will
old shakespeare receive him with praise and with love
and beaumonts and bens be his kellys above


here hickey reclines a most blunt pleasant creature
and slander itself must allow him good nature
he cherishd his friend and he relishd a bumper
yet one fault he had and that one was a thumper
perhaps you may ask if the man was a miser
i answer no no for he always was wiser


too courteous perhaps or obligingly flat
his very worst foe cant accuse him of that
perhaps he confided in men as they go
and so was too foolishly honest ah no
then what was his failing come tell it and burn ye
he was could he help it a special attorney


here reynolds is laid and to tell you my mind
he has not left a better or wiser behind
his pencil was striking resistless and grand
his manners were gentle complying and bland
still born to improve us in every part
his pencil our faces his manners our heart
to coxcombs averse yet most civilly steering
when they judgd without skill he was still hard of hearing
when they talkd of their raphaels correggios and stuff
he shifted his trumpet and only took snuff


here whitefoord reclines and deny it who can
though he merrily livd he is now a grave man
rare compound of oddity frolic and fun
who relishd a joke and rejoicd in a pun
whose temper was generous open sincere
a stranger to flattry a stranger to fear
who scatterd around wit and humour at will
whose daily bons mots half a column might fill
a scotchman from pride and from prejudice free
a scholar yet surely no pedant was he


what pity alas that so libral a mind
should so long be to newspaper essays confind
who perhaps to the summit of science could soar
yet content if the table he set on a roar
whose talents to fill any station were fit
yet happy if woodfall confessd him a wit


ye newspaper witlings ye pert scribbling folks
who copied his squibs and reechoed his jokes
ye tame imitators ye servile herd come
still follow your master and visit his tomb
to deck it bring with you festoons of the vine
and copious libations bestow on his shrine
then strew all around it you can do no less
crossreadings shipnews and mistakes of the press


merry whitefoord farewell for thy sake i admit
that a scot may have humour i had almost said wit
this debt to thy memry i cannot refuse
thou best humourd man with the worst humourd muse


ah me when shall i marry me
lovers are plenty but fail to relieve me
he fond youth that could carry me
offers to love but means to deceive me


but i will rally and combat the ruiner
not a look not a smile shall my passion discover
she that gives all to the false one pursuing her
makes but a penitent loses a lover


chaste are their instincts faithful is their fire
no foreign beauty tempts to false desire
the snowwhite vesture and the glittering crown
the simple plumage or the glossy down
prompt not their loves the patriot bird pursues
his well acquainted tints and kindred hues
hence through their tribes no mixd polluted flame
no monsterbreed to mark the groves with shame
but the chaste blackbird to its partner true
thinks black alone is beautys favourite hue
the nightingale with mutual passion blest
sings to its mate and nightly charms the nest
while the dark owl to court its partner flies
and owns its offspring in their yellow eyes


thanks my lord for your venison for finer or fatter
never rangd in a forest or smokd in a platter
the haunch was a picture for painters to study
the fat was so white and the lean was so ruddy
though my stomach was sharp i could scarce help regretting
to spoil such a delicate picture by eating
i had thoughts in my chambers to place it in view
to be shown to my friends as a piece of virtu
as in some irish houses where things are so so
one gammon of bacon hangs up for a show
but for eating a rasher of what they take pride in
theyd as soon think of eating the pan it is fried in
but hold let me pause dont i hear you pronounce
this tale of the bacon a damnable bounce
well suppose it a bounce sure a poet may try
by a bounce now and then to get courage to fly


but my lord its no bounce i protest in my turn
its a truth and your lordship may ask mr byrne
to go on with my tale as i gazd on the haunch
i thought of a friend that was trusty and staunch
so i cut it and sent it to reynolds undressd
to paint it or eat it just as he likd best
of the neck and the breast i had next to dispose
twas a neck and a breast that might rival mrs
but in parting with these i was puzzled again
with the how and the who and the where and the when
theres hd and cy and hrth and hff
i think they love venison i know they love beef
theres my countryman hggns oh let him alone
for making a blunder or picking a bone
but hang it to poets who seldom can eat
your very good muttons a very good treat


such dainties to them their health it might hurt
its like sending them ruffles when wanting a shirt
while thus i debated in reverie centred
an acquaintance a friend as he calld himself enterd
an underbred finespoken fellow was he
and he smild as he lookd at the venison and me
what have we got here why this is good eating
your own i suppose or is it in waiting
why whose should it be cried i with a flounce
i get these things often but that was a bounce
some lords my acquaintance that settle the nation
are pleasd to be kind but i hate ostentation


if that be the case then cried he very gay
im glad i have taken this house in my way
tomorrow you take a poor dinner with me
no words i insist ont precisely at three
well have johnson and burke all the wits will be there
my acquaintance is slight or id ask my lord clare


and now that i think ont as i am a sinner
we wanted this venison to make out the dinner
what say you a pasty it shall and it must
and my wife little kitty is famous for crust
here porter this venison with me to mileend
no stirring i beg my dear friend my dear friend
thus snatching his hat he brushd off like the wind
and the porter and eatables followd behind


left alone to reflect having emptied my shelf
and nobody with me at sea but myself
though i could not help thinking my gentleman hasty
yet johnson and burke and a good venison pasty
were things that i never dislikd in my life
though cloggd with a coxcomb and kitty his wife
so next day in due splendour to make my approach
i drove to his door in my own hackney coach


when come to the place where we all were to dine
a chairlumberd closet just twelve feet by nine
my friend bade me welcome but struck me quite dumb
with tidings that johnson and burke would not come
for i knew it he cried both eternally fail
the one with his speeches and tother with thrale
but no matter ill warrant well make up the party
with two full as clever and ten times as hearty
the one is a scotchman the other a jew
theyre both of them merry and authors like you


the one writes the snarler the other the scourge
some think he writes cinna he own to panurge
while thus he describd them by trade and by name
they enterd and dinner was servd as they came


at the top a fried liver and bacon were seen
at the bottom was tripe in a swinging tureen
at the sides there was spinach and pudding made hot
in the middle a place where the pasty was not
now my lord as for tripe its my utter aversion
and your bacon i hate like a turk or a persian
so there i sat stuck like a horse in a pound
while the bacon and liver went merrily round
but what vexd me most was that dd scottish rogue
with his longwinded speeches his smiles and his brogue
and madam quoth he may this bit be my poison
a prettier dinner i never set eyes on
pray a slice of your liver though may i be cursd
but ive eat of your tripe till im ready to burst
the tripe quoth the jew with his chocolate cheek
i could dine on this tripe seven days in the week


i like these here dinners so pretty and small
but your friend there the doctor eats nothing at all
ooh quoth my friend hell come on in a trice
hes keeping a corner for something thats nice
theres a pasty a pasty repeated the jew
i dont care if i keep a corner fort too
what the deil mon a pasty reechoed the scot
though splitting ill still keep a corner for thot
well all keep a corner the lady cried out
well all keep a corner was echoed about
while thus we resolvd and the pasty delayd
with look that quite petrified enterd the maid


a visage so sad and so pale with affright
wakd priam in drawing his curtains by night
but we quickly found out for who could mistake her
that she came with some terrible news from the baker
and so it fell out for that negligent sloven
had shut out the pasty on shutting his oven
sad philomel thus but let similes drop
and now that i think ont the story may stop
to be plain my good lord its but labour misplacd
to send such good verses to one of your taste


youve got an odd something a kind of discerning
a relish a taste sickend over by learning
at least its your temper as very well known
that you think very slightly of all thats your own
so perhaps in your habits of thinking amiss
you may make a mistake and think slightly of this


this tomb inscribd to gentle parnells name
may speak our gratitude but not his fame
what heart but feels his sweetlymoral lay
that leads to truth through pleasures flowery way
celestial themes confessd his tuneful aid
and heaven that lent him genius was repaid
needless to him the tribute we bestow
the transitory breath of fame below
more lasting rapture from his works shall rise
while converts thank their poet in the skies


john trott was desired by two witty peers
to tell them the reason why asses had ears
ant please you quoth john im not given to letters
nor dare i pretend to know more than my betters
howeer from this time i shall neer see your graces
as i hope to be saved without thinking on asses


here lies poor ned purdon from misery freed
who long was a booksellers hack
he led such a damnable life in this world
i dont think hell wish to come back


hold prompter hold a word before your nonsense
id speak a word or two to ease my conscience
my pride forbids it ever should be said
my heels eclipsd the honours of my head
that i found humour in a piebald vest
or ever thought that jumping was a jest


whence and what art thou visionary birth
nature disowns and reason scorns thy mirth
in thy black aspect every passion sleeps
the joy that dimples and the woe that weeps
how has thou filld the scene with all thy brood
of fools pursuing and of fools pursud


whose ins and outs no ray of sense discloses
whose only plot it is to break our noses
whilst from below the trapdoor demons rise
and from above the dangling deities
and shall i mix in this unhallowd crew
may rosined lightning blast me if i do
no i will act ill vindicate the stage
shakespeare himself shall feel my tragic rage
off off vile trappings a new passion reigns
the maddning monarch revels in my veins


aye twas but a dream for now theres no retreating
if i cease harlequin i cease from eating
twas thus that aesops stag a creature blameless
yet something vain like one that shall be nameless
once on the margin of a fountain stood
and cavilld at his image in the flood
the deuce confound he cries these drumstick shanks
they never have my gratitude nor thanks
theyre perfectly disgraceful strike me dead
but for a head yes yes i have a head


how piercing is that eye how sleek that brow
my horns im told horns are the fashion now
whilst thus he spoke astonishd to his view
near and more near the hounds and huntsmen drew
hoicks hark forward came thundring from behind
he bounds aloft outstrips the fleeting wind
he quits the woods and tries the beaten ways
he starts he pants he takes the circling maze
at length his silly head so prizd before
is taught his former folly to deplore
whilst his strong limbs conspire to set him free
and at one bound he saves himself like me
taking a hump through the stage door


there is a place so ariosto sings
a treasury for lost and missing things
lost human wits have places assignd them
and they who lose their senses there may find them
but wheres this place this storehouse of the age
the moon says he but i affirm the stage
at least in many things i think i see
his lunar and our mimic world agree
both shine at night for but at footes alone
we scarce exhibit till the sun goes down


both prone to change no settled limits fix
and sure the folks of both are lunatics
but in this parallel my best pretence is
that mortals visit both to find their senses
to this strange spot rakes macaronies cits
come thronging to collect their scatterd wits
the gay coquette who ogles all the day
comes here at night and goes a prude away


hither the affected city dame advancing
who sighs for operas and dotes on dancing
taught by our art her ridicule to pause on
quits the ballet and calls for nancy dawson
the gamester too whose wits all high or low
oft risks his fortune on one desperate throw
comes here to saunter having made his bets
finds his lost senses out and pay his debts
the mohawk too with angry phrases stored
as d sir and sir i wear a sword
here lessond for a while and hence retreating
goes out affronts his man and takes a beating
here come the sons of scandal and of news
but find no sense for they had none to lose


of all the tribe here wanting an adviser
our authors the least likely to grow wiser
has he not seen how you your favour place
on sentimental queens and lords in lace
without a star a coronet or garter
how can the piece expect or hope for quarter
no highlife scenes no sentiment the creature
still stoops among the low to copy nature
yes hes far gone and yet some pity fix
the english laws forbid to punish lunatics


your mandate i got
you may all go to pot
had your senses been right
youd have sent before night
as i hope to be saved
i put off being shaved
for i could not make bold
while the matter was cold
to meddle in suds
or to put on my duds
so tell horneck and nesbitt
and baker and his bit
and kauffmann beside
and the jessamy bride
with the rest of the crew
the reynoldses two


little comedys face
and the captain in lace
bythebye you may tell him
i have something to sell him
of use i insist
when he comes to enlist
your worships must know
that a few days ago
an order went out
for the foot guards so stout
to wear tails in high taste
twelve inches at least
now ive got him a scale
to measure each tail


to lengthen a short tail
and a long one to curtail
yet how can i when vext
thus stray from my text
tell each other to rue
your devonshire crew
for sending so late
to one of my state
but tis reynoldss way
from wisdom to stray
and angelicas whim
to be frolick like him
but alas your good worships how could they be wiser
when both have been spoild in todays advertiser


first let me suppose what may shortly be true
the company set and the word to be loo
all smirking and pleasant and big with adventure
and ogling the stake which is fixd in the centre
round and round go the cards while i inwardly damn
at never once finding a visit from pam
i lay down my stake apparently cool
while the harpies about me all pocket the pool
i fret in my gizzard yet cautious and sly
i wish all my friends may be bolder than i
yet still they sit snug not a creature will aim
by losing their money to venture at fame


tis in vain that at niggardly caution i scold
tis in vain that i flatter the brave and the bold
all play their own way and they think me an ass
what does mrs bunbury i sir i pass
pray what does miss horneck take courage come do
who i let me see sir why i must pass too

by the gods ill enjoy it though tis but in thought
both are placd at the bar with all proper decorum
with bunches of fennel and nosegays before em
both cover their faces with mobs and all that
but the judge bids them angrily take off their hat

armies of box that sportively engage
and mimic real battles in their rage
pleased i recount how smit with glorys charms
two mighty monarchs met in adverse arms
sable and white assist me to explore
ye serian nymphs what neer was sung before
no path appears yet resolute i stray
where youth undaunted bids me force my way
oer rocks and cliffs while i the task pursue
guide me ye nymphs with your unerring clue
for you the rise of this diversion know
you first were pleased in italy to show
this studious sport from scacchis was its name
the pleasing record of your sisters fame


when jove through ethiopias parchd extent
to grace the nuptials of old ocean went
each god was there and mirth and joy around
to shores remote diffused their happy sound
then when their hunger and their thirst no more
claimd their attention and the feast was oer
ocean with pastime to divert the thought
commands a painted table to be brought
sixtyfour spaces fill the chequerd square
eight in each rank eight equal limits share
alike their form but different are their dyes
they fade alternate and alternate rise
white after black such various stains as those
the shelving backs of tortoises disclose
then to the gods that mute and wondering sate
you see says he the field prepared for fate
here will the little armies please your sight
with adverse colours hurrying to the fight
on which so oft with silent sweet surprise
the nymphs and nereids used to feast their eyes
and all the neighbours of the hoary deep
when calm the sea and winds were lulld asleep
but see the mimic heroes tread the board
he said and straightway from an urn he pourd
the sculptured box that neatly seemd to ape
the graceful figure of a human shape
equal the strength and number of each foe
sixteen appeard like jet sixteen like snow
as their shape varies various is the name
different their posts nor is their strength the same
there might you see two kings with equal pride
gird on their arms their consorts by their side
here the footwarriors glowing after fame
there prancing knights and dexterous archers came
and elephants that on their backs sustain
vast towers of war and fill and shake the plain


and now both hosts preparing for the storm
of adverse battle their encampments form
in the fourth space and on the farthest line
directly opposite the monarchs shine
the swarthy on white ground on sable stands
the silver king and then they send commands
nearest to these the queens exert their might
one the left side and tother guards the right
where each by her respective armour known
chooses the colour that is like her own
then the young archers two that snowywhite
bend the tough yew and two as black as night
greece calld them marss favourites heretofore
from their delight in war and thirst of gore
these on each side the monarch and his queen
surround obedient next to these are seen
the crested knights in golden armour gay
their steeds by turns curvet or snort or neigh
in either army on each distant wing
two mighty elephants their castles bring
bulwarks immense and then at last combine
eight of the foot to form the second line
the vanguard to the king and queen from far
prepared to open all the fate of war
so moved the boxen hosts each doublelined
their different colours floating in the wind
as if an army of the gauls should go
with their white standards oer the alpine snow
to meet in rigid fight on scorching sands
the sunburnt moors and memnons swarthy bands


then father ocean thus you see them here
celestial powers what troops what camps appear
learn now the sevral orders of the fray
for een these arms their stated laws obey
to lead the fight the kings from all their bands
choose whom they please to bear their great commands
should a black hero first to battle go
instant a white one guards against the blow
but only one at once can charge or shun the foe
their genral purpose on one scheme is bent
so to besiege the king within the tent
that there remains no place by subtle flight
from danger free and that decides the fight
meanwhile howeer the sooner to destroy
th imperial prince remorseless they employ
their swords in blood and whosoever dare
oppose their vengeance in the ruin share
fate thins their camp the particoloured field
widens apace as they oercome or yield
but the proud victor takes the captives post
there fronts the fury of th avenging host
one single shock and should he ward the blow
may then retire at pleasure from the foe
the foot alone so their harsh laws ordain
when they proceed can neer return again


but neither all rush on alike to prove
the terror of their arms the foot must move
directly on and but a single square
yet may these heroes when they first prepare
to mix in combat on the bloody mead
double their sally and two steps proceed
but when they wound their swords they subtly guide
with aim oblique and slanting pierce his side
but the great indian beasts whose backs sustain
vast turrets armd when on the reddning plain
they join in all the terror of the fight
forward or backward to the left or right
run furious and impatient of confine
scour through the field and threat the farthest line
yet must they neer obliquely aim their blows
that only manner is allowd to those
whom mars has favourd most who bend the stubborn bows
these glancing sidewards in a straight career
yet each confind to their respective sphere
or white or black can send th unerring dart
wingd with swift death to pierce through evry part
the fiery steed regardless of the reins
comes prancing on but sullenly disdains
the path direct and boldly wheeling round
leaps oer a double space at evry bound
and shifts from white or black to diffrent colourd ground
but the fierce queen whom dangers neer dismay
the strength and terror of the bloody day
in a straight line spreads her destruction wide
to left or right before behind aside
yet may she never with a circling course
sweep to the battle like the fretful horse
but unconfind may at her pleasure stray
if neither friend nor foe block up the way
for to oerleap a warrior tis decreed
those only dare who curb the snorting steed
with greater caution and majestic state
the warlike monarchs in the scene of fate
direct their motions since for these appear
zealous each hope and anxious evry fear
while the kings safe with resolution stern
they clasp their arms but should a sudden turn
make him a captive instantly they yield
resolved to share his fortune in the field
he moves on slow with reverence profound
his faithful troops encompass him around
and oft to break some instant fatal scheme
rush to their fates their sovreign to redeem
while he unanxious where to wound the foe
need only shift and guard against a blow
but none however can presume t appear
within his reach but must his vengeance fear
for he on evry side his terror throws
but when he changes from his first repose
moves but one step most awfully sedate
or idly roving or intent on fate
these are the sevral and establishd laws
now see how each maintains his bloody cause


here paused the god but since wheneer they wage
war here on earth the gods themselves engage
in mutual battle as they hate or love
and the most stubborn war is oft above
almighty jove commands the circling train
of gods from favring either to abstain
and let the fight be silently surveyd
and added solemn threats if disobeyd
then calld he phoebus from among the powers
and subtle hermes whom in softer hours
fair maia bore youth wantond in their face
both in lifes bloom both shone with equal grace
hermes as yet had never wingd his feet
as yet apollo in his radiant seat
had never drivn his chariot through the air
known by his bow alone and golden hair
these jove commissiond to attempt the fray
and rule the sportive military day
bid them agree which party each maintains
and promised a reward thats worth their pains
the greater took their seats on either hand
respectful the less gods in order stand
but careful not to interrupt their play
by hinting when t advance or run away


then they examine who shall first proceed
to try their courage and their army lead
chance gave it for the white that he should go
first with a brave defiance to the foe
awhile he ponderd which of all his train
should bear his first commission oer the plain
and then determined to begin the scene
with him that stood before to guard the queen
he took a double step with instant care
does the black monarch in his turn prepare
the adverse champion and with stern command
bid him repel the charge with equal hand
there front to front the midst of all the field
with furious threats their shining arms they wield
yet vain the conflict neither can prevail
while in one path each other they assail
on evry side to their assistance fly
their fellow soldiers and with strong supply
crowd to the battle but no bloody stain
tinctures their armour sportive in the plain
mars plays awhile and in excursion slight
harmless they sally forth or wait the fight


but now the swarthy foot that first appeard
to front the foe his pondrous javlin reard
leftward aslant and a pale warrior slays
spurns him aside and boldly takes his place
unhappy youth his danger not to spy
instant he fell and triumphd but to die
at this the sable king with prudent care
removed his station from the middle square
and slow retiring to the farthest ground
there safely lurkd with troops entrenchd around
then from each quarter to the war advance
the furious knights and poise the trembling lance
by turns they rush by turns the victors yield
heaps of dead foot choke up the crimsond field
they fall unable to retreat around
the clang of arms and iron hoofs resound


but while young phoebus pleased himself to view
his furious knight destroy the vulgar crew
sly hermes longd t attempt with secret aim
some noble act of more exalted fame
for this he inoffensive passd along
through ranks of foot and midst the trembling throng
sent his left horse that free without confine
rovd oer the plain upon some great design
against the king himself at length he stood
and having fixd his station as he would
threatend at once with instant fate the king
and th indian beast that guarded the right wing
apollo sighd and hastning to relieve
the straitend monarch grievd that he must leave
his martial elephant exposd to fate
and viewd with pitying eyes his dangrous state
first in his thoughts however was his care
to save his king whom to the neighbouring square
on the right hand he snatchd with trembling flight
at this with fury springs the sable knight
drew his keen sword and rising to the blow
sent the great indian brute to shades below
o fatal loss for none except the queen
spreads such a terror through the bloody scene
thus close besiegd trembling he cast his eye
around the plain but saw no shelter nigh
no way for flight for here the queen opposd
the foot in phalanx there the passage closd
at length he fell yet not unpleasd with fate
since victim to a queens vindictive hate
with grief and fury burns the whitend host
one of their towrs thus immaturely lost
as when a bull has in contention stern
lost his right horn with double vengeance burn
his thoughts for war with blood hes coverd oer
and the woods echo to his dismal roar
so lookd the flaxen host when angry fate
oerturnd the indian bulwark of their state
fired at this great success with double rage
apollo hurries on his troops t engage
for blood and havoc wild and while he leads
his troops thus careless loses both his steeds
for if some adverse warriors were oerthrown
he little thought what dangers threat his own


but slyer hermes with observant eyes
marchd slowly cautious and at distance spies
what moves must next succeed what dangers next arise
often would he the stately queen to snare
the slender foot to front her arms prepare
and to conceal his scheme he sighs and feigns
such a wrong step would frustrate all his pains
just then an archer from the righthand view
at the pale queen his arrow boldly drew
unseen by phoebus who with studious thought
from the left side a vulgar hero brought
but tender venus with a pitying eye
viewing the sad destruction that was nigh
winkd upon phoebus for the goddess sat
by chance directly opposite at that
roused in an instant young apollo threw
his eyes around the field his troops to view
perceivd the danger and with sudden fright
withdrew the foot that he had sent to fight
and savd his trembling queen by seasonable flight
but maias son with shouts filld all the coast
the queen he cried the important queen is lost
phoebus howeer resolving to maintain
what he had done bespoke the heavenly train
what mighty harm in sportive mimic flight
is it to set a little blunder right
when no preliminary rule debarrd
if you henceforward mercury would guard
against such practice let us make the law
and whosoeer shall first to battle draw
or white or black remorseless let him go
at all events and dare the angry foe
he said and this opinion pleased around
jove turnd aside and on his daughter frownd
unmarkd by hermes who with strange surprise
fretted and foamd and rolld his ferret eyes
and but with great reluctance could refrain
from dashing at a blow all off the plain
then he resolved to interweave deceits
to carry on the war by tricks and cheats
instant he calld an archer from the throng
and bid him like the courser wheel along
bounding he springs and threats the pallid queen
the fraud however was by phoebus seen
he smiled and turning to the gods he said
though hermes you are perfect in your trade
and you can trick and cheat to great surprise
these little sleights no more shall blind my eyes
correct them if you please the more you thus disguise


the circle laughd aloud and maias son
as if it had but by mistake been done
recalld his archer and with motion due
bid him advance the combat to renew
but phoebus watchd him with a jealous eye
fearing some trick was ever lurking nigh
for he would oft with sudden sly design
send forth at once two combatants to join
his warring troops against the law of arms
unless the wary foe was ever in alarms


now the white archer with his utmost force
bent the tough bow against the sable horse
and drove him from the queen where he had stood
hoping to glut his vengeance with her blood
then the right elephant with martial pride
roved here and there and spread his terrors wide
glittering in arms from far a courser came
threatend at once the king and royal dame
thought himself safe when he the post had seized
and with the future spoils his fancy pleased
fired at the danger a young archer came
rushd on the foe and levelld sure his aim
and though a pawn his sword in vengeance draws
gladly hed lose his life in glorys cause
the whistling arrow to his bowels flew
and the sharp steel his blood profusely drew
he drops the reins he totters to the ground
and his life issued murmring through the wound


pierced by the foot this archer bit the plain
the foot himself was by another slain
and with inflamed revenge the battle burns again
towers archers knights meet on the crimson ground
and the field echoes to the martial sound
their thoughts are heated and their courage fired
thick they rush on with double zeal inspired
generals and foot with different colourd mien
confusedly warring in the camps are seen
valour and fortune meet in one promiscuous scene


now these victorious lord it oer the field
now the foe rallies the triumphant yield
just as the tide of battle ebbs or flows
as when the conflict more tempestuous grows
between the winds with strong and boisterous sweep
they plough th ionian or atlantic deep
by turns prevail the mutual blustering roar
and the big waves alternate lash the shore
but in the midst of all the battle raged
the snowy queen with troops at once engaged
she felld an archer as she sought the plain
as she retired an elephant was slain
to right and left her fatal spears she sent
burst through the ranks and triumphd as she went
through arms and blood she seeks a glorious fate
pierces the farthest lines and nobly great
leads on her army with a gallant show
breaks the battalions and cuts through the foe
at length the sable king his fears betrayd
and beggd his military consorts aid
with cheerful speed she flew to his relief
and met in equal arms the female chief


who first great queen and who at last did bleed
how many whites lay gasping on the mead
half dead and floating in a bloody tide
foot knights and archer lie on every side
who can recount the slaughter of the day
how many leaders threw their lives away
the chequerd plain is filld with dying box
havoc ensues and with tumultuous shocks
the different colourd ranks in blood engage
and foot and horse promiscuously rage
with nobler courage and superior might
the dreadful amazons sustain the fight
resolved alike to mix in glorious strife
till to imperious fate they yield their life


meanwhile each monarch in a neighbouring cell
confined the warriors that in battle fell
there watchd the captives with a jealous eye
lest slipping out again to arms they fly
and slyly pushd em forward on the plain
th enlivend combatants their arms regain
mix in the bloody scene and boldly war again


so the foul hag in screaming wild alarms
oer a dead carcase muttering her charms
and with her frequent and tremendous yell
forcing great hecate from out of hell
shoots in the corpse a new fictitious soul
with instant glare the supple eyeballs roll
again it moves and speaks and life informs the whole


vulcan alone discernd the subtle cheat
and wisely scorning such a base deceit
calld out to phoebus grief and rage assail
phoebus by turns detected mars turns pale
then awful jove with sullen eye reproved
mars and the captives orderd to be moved
to their dark caves bid each fictitious spear
be straight recalld and all be as they were


and now both monarchs with redoubled rage
led on their queens the mutual war to wage
oer all the field their thirsty spears they send
then front to front their monarchs they defend
but lo the female white rushd in unseen
and slew with fatal haste the swarthy queen
yet soon alas resignd her royal spoils
snatchd by a shaft from her successful toils
struck at the sight both hosts in wild surprise
pourd forth their tears and filld the air with cries
they wept and sighd as passd the funral train
as if both armies had at once been slain


and now each troop surrounds its mourning chief
to guard his person or assuage his grief
one is their common fear one stormy blast
has equally made havoc as it passd
not all however of their youth are slain
some champions yet the vigrous war maintain
three foot an archer and a stately tower
for phoebus still exert their utmost power
just the same number mercury can boast
except the tower who lately in his post
unarmd inglorious fell in peace profound
pierced by an archer with a distant wound
but his right horse retaind its mettled pride
the rest were swept away by wars strong tide


but fretful hermes with despairing moan
grievd that so many champions were oerthrown
yet reassumes the fight and summons round
the little straggling army that he found
all that had scaped from fierce apollos rage
resolved with greater caution to engage
in future strife by subtle wiles if fate
should give him leave to save his sinking state


the sable troops advance with prudence slow
bent on all hazards to distress the foe
more cheerful phoebus with unequal pace
rallies his arms to lessen his disgrace
but what strange havoc everywhere has been
a straggling champion here and there is seen
th afflicted kings bewail their consorts dead
and loathe the thoughts of a deserted bed
and though each monarch studies to improve
the tender memry of his former love
their state requires a second nuptial tie
hence the pale ruler with a lovesick eye
surveys th attendants of his former wife
and offers one of them a royal life
these when their martial mistress had been slain
weak and despairing tried their arms in vain
willing howeer amidst the black to go
they thirst for speedy vengeance on the foe
then he resolves to see who merits best
by strength and courage the imperial vest
points out the foe bids each with bold design
pierce through the ranks and reach the deepest line
for none must hope with monarchs to repose
but who can first through thick surrounding foes
through arms and wiles with hazardous essay
safe to the farthest quarters force their way
fired at the thought with sudden joyful pace
they hurry on but first of all the race
runs the third righthand warrior for the prize
the glittring crown already charms her eyes


her dear associates cheerfully give oer
the nuptial chase and swift she flies before
and glory lent her wings and the reward in store
nor would the sable king her hopes prevent
for he himself was on a queen intent
alternate therefore through the field they go
hermes led on but by a step too slow
his fourth left pawn and now th adventrous white
had marchd through all and gaind the wishd for site
then the pleased king gives orders to prepare
the crown the sceptre and the royal chair
and owns her for his queen around exult
the snowy troops and oer the black insult


hermes burst into tears with fretful roar
filld the wide air and his gay vesture tore
the swarthy foot had only to advance
one single step but oh malignant chance
a towered elephant with fatal aim
stood ready to destroy her when she came
he keeps a watchful eye upon the whole
threatens her entrance and protects the goal
meanwhile the royal newcreated bride
pleased with her pomp spread death and terror wide
like lightning through the sable troops she flies
clashes her arms and seems to threat the skies
the sable troops are sunk in wild affright
and wish th earth opning snatchd em from her sight


in burst the queen with vast impetuous swing
the trembling foes come swarming round the king
where in the midst he stood and form a valiant ring


so the poor cows straggling oer pasture land
when they perceive the prowling wolf at hand
crowd close together in a circle full
and beg the succour of the lordly bull
they clash their horns they low with dreadful sound
and the remotest groves reecho round


but the bold queen victorious from behind
pierces the foe yet chiefly she designd
against the king himself some fatal aim
and full of war to his pavilion came
now here she rushd now there and had she been
but duly prudent she had slippd between
with course oblique into the fourth white square
and the long toil of war had ended there
the king had fallen and all his sable state
and vanquishd hermes cursed his partial fate
for thence with ease the championess might go
murder the king and none could ward the blow


with silence hermes and with panting heart
perceived the danger but with subtle art
lest he should see the place spurs on the foe
confounds his thoughts and blames his being slow
for shame move on would you for ever stay
what sloth is this what strange perverse delay
how could you eer my little pausing blame
what you would wait till night shall end the game
phoebus thus nettled with imprudence slew
a vulgar pawn but lost his nobler view
young hermes leapd with sudden joy elate
and then to save the monarch from his fate


led on his martial knight who steppd between
pleased that his charge was to oppose the queen
then pondering how the indian beast to slay
that stoppd the foot from making farther way
from being made a queen with slanting aim
an archer struck him down the monster came
and dying shook the earth while phoebus tries
without success the monarch to surprise
the foot then uncontrolld with instant pride
seized the last spot and moved a royal bride
and now with equal strength both war again
and bring their second wives upon the plain
then though with equal views each hopd and feard
yet as if every doubt had disappeard


as if he had the palm young hermes flies
into excess of joy with deep disguise
extols his own black troops with frequent spite
and with invective taunts disdains the white
whom phoebus thus reproved with quick return
as yet we cannot the decision learn
of this dispute and do you triumph now
then your big words and vauntings ill allow
when you the battle shall completely gain
at present i shall make your boasting vain
he said and forward led the daring queen
instant the fury of the bloody scene
rises tumultuous swift the warriors fly
from either side to conquer or to die


they front the storm of war around em fear
terror and death perpetually appear
all meet in arms and man to man oppose
each from their camp attempts to drive their foes
each tries by turns to force the hostile lines
chance and impatience blast their best designs
the sable queen spread terror as she went
through the mid ranks with more reserved intent
the adverse dame declined the open fray
and to the king in private stole away
then took the royal guard and bursting in
with fatal menace close besieged the king
alarmd at this the swarthy queen in haste
from all her havoc and destructive waste
broke off and her contempt of death to show
leapd in between the monarch and the foe
to save the king and state from this impending blow


but phoebus met a worse misfortune here
for hermes now led forward void of fear
his furious horse into the open plain
that onward chafed and pranced and pawed amain
nor ceased from his attempts until he stood
on the longwishedfor spot from whence he could
slay king or queen oerwhelmd with sudden fears
apollo saw and could not keep from tears


now all seemd ready to be overthrown
his strength was witherd evry hope was flown
hermes exulting at this great surprise
shouted for joy and filld the air with cries
instant he sent the queen to shades below
and of her spoils made a triumphant show
but in return and in his mid career
fell his brave knight beneath the monarchs spear


phoebus however did not yet despair
but still fought on with courage and with care
he had but two poor common men to show
and marss favourite with his ivry bow
the thoughts of ruin made em dare their best
to save their king so fatally distressd
but the sad hour required not such an aid
and hermes breathed revenge whereer he strayd
fierce comes the sable queen with fatal threat
surrounds the monarch in his royal seat


rushed here and there nor rested till she slew
the last remainder of the whitend crew
sole stood the king the midst of all the plain
weak and defenceless his companions slain
as when the ruddy morn ascending high
has chased the twinkling stars from all the sky
your star fair venus still retains its light
and loveliest goes the latest out of sight
no safetys left no gleams of hope remain
yet did he not as vanquishd quit the plain
but tried to shut himself between the foe
unhurt through swords and spears he hoped to go
until no room was left to shun the fatal blow


for if none threatend his immediate fate
and his next move must ruin all his state
vain all the bloody carnage of the plain
neither would triumph then the laurel neither gain
therefore through each void space and desert tent
by different moves his various course he bent
the black king watchd him with observant eye
followd him close but left him room to fly
then when he saw him take the farthest line
he sent the queen his motions to confine
and guard the second rank that he could go
no farther now than to that distant row
the sable monarch then with cheerful mien
approachd but always with one space between
but as the king stood oer against him there
helpless forlorn and sunk in his despair
the martial queen her lucky moment knew
seized on the farthest seat with fatal view
nor left th unhappy king a place to flee unto
at length in vengeance her keen sword she draws
slew him and ended thus the bloody cause
and all the gods around approved it with applause


the victor could not from his insults keep
but laughd and sneerd to see apollo weep
jove calld him near and gave him in his hand
the powerful happy and mysterious wand
by which the shades are calld to purer day
when penal fire has purged their sins away
by which the guilty are condemnd to dwell
in the dark mansions of the deepest hell
by which he gives us sleep or sleep denies
and closes at the last the dying eyes
soon after this the heavenly victor brought
the game on earth and first th italians taught


for as they say fair scacchis he espied
feeding her cygnets in the silver tide
sacchis the loveliest seriad of the place
and as she strayd took her to his embrace
then to reward her for her virtue lost
gave her the men and chequerd board embossd
with gold and silver curiously inlayd
and taught her how the game was to be playd
evn now tis honourd with her happy name
and rome and all the world admire the game
all which the seriads told me heretofore
when my boynotes amused the serian shore


fidessa fair long live a happy maiden
blest from thy cradle by a worthy mother
highthoughted like to her with bounty laden
like pleasing grace affording one and other
sweet model of thy far renowned sire
hold back a while thy evergiving hand
and though these free penned lines do nought require
for that they scorn at base reward to stand
yet crave they most for that they beg the least
dumb is the message of my hidden grief
and store of speech by silence is increased
o let me die or purchase some relief
bounteous fidessa cannot be so cruel
as for to make my heart her fancys fuel


how can that piercing crystalpainted eye
that gave the onset to my high aspiring
yielding each look of mine a sweet reply
adding new courage to my hearts desiring
how can it shut itself within her ark
and keep herself and me both from the light
making us walk in all misguiding dark
aye to remain in confines of the night
how is it that so little room contains it
that guides the orient as the world the sun
which once obscured most bitterly complains it
because it knows and rules whateer is done
the reason is that they may dread her sight
who doth both give and take away their light


venus and young adonis sitting by her
under a myrtle shade began to woo him
she told the youngling how god mars did try her
and as he fell to her so fell she to him
even thus quoth she the wanton god embraced me
and then she clasped adonis in her arms
even thus quoth she the warlike god unlaced me
as if the boy should use like loving charms
but he a wayward boy refused the offer
and ran away the beauteous queen neglecting
showing both folly to abuse her proffer
and all his sex of cowardice detecting
o that i had my mistress at that bay
to kiss and clip me till i ran away


did you sometimes three german brethren see
rancour twixt two of them so raging rife
that th one could stick the other with his knife
now if the third assaulted chance to be
by a fourth stranger him set on the three
them two twixt whom afore was deadly strife
made one to rob the stranger of his life
then do you know our state as well as we
beauty and chastity with her were born
both at one birth and up with her did grow
beauty still foe to chastity was sworn
and chastity sworn to be beautys foe
and yet when i lay siege unto her heart
beauty and chastity both take her part


arraigned poor captive at the bar i stand
the bar of beauty bar to all my joys
and up i hold my ever trembling hand
wishing or life or death to end annoys
and when the judge doth question of the guilt
and bids me speak then sorrow shuts up words
yea though he say speak boldly what thou wilt
yet my confused affects no speech affords
for why alas my passions have no bound
for fear of death that penetrates so near
and still one grief another doth confound
yet doth at length a way to speech appear
then for i speak too late the judge doth give
his sentence that in prison i shall live


unhappy sentence worst of worst of pains
to be in darksome silence out of ken
banished from all that bliss the world contains
and thrust from out the companies of men
unhappy sentence worse than worst of deaths
never to see fidessas lovely face
o better were i lose ten thousand breaths
than ever live in such unseen disgrace
unhappy sentence worse than pains of hell
to live in selftormenting griefs alone
having my heart my prison and my cell
and there consumed without relief to moan
if that the sentence so unhappy be
then what am i that gave the same to me


oft have mine eyes the agents of mine heart
false traitor eyes conspiring my decay
pleaded for grace with dumb and silent art
streaming forth tears my sorrows to allay
moaning the wrong they do unto their lord
forcing the cruel fair by means to yield
making her gainst her will some grace tafford
and striving sore at length to win the field
thus work they means to feed my fainting hope
and strengthened hope adds matter to each thought
yet when they all come to their end and scope
they do but wholly bring poor me to nought
shell never yield although they ever cry
and therefore we must all together die


griefurging guest great cause have i to plain me
yet hope persuading hope expecteth grace
and saith none but myself shall ever pain me
but grief my hopes exceedeth in this case
for still my fortune ever more doth cross me
by worse events than ever i expected
and here and there ten thousand ways doth toss me
with sad remembrance of my time neglected
these breed such thoughts as set my heart on fire
and like fell hounds pursue me to my death
traitors unto their sovereign lord and sire
unkind exactors of their fathers breath
whom in their rage they shall no sooner kill
than they themselves themselves unjustly spill


my spotless love that never yet was tainted
my loyal heart that never can be moved
my growing hope that never yet hath fainted
my constancy that you full well have proved
all these consented have to plead for grace
these all lie crying at the door of beauty
this wails this sends out tears this cries apace
all do reward expect of faith and duty
now either thou must prove th unkindest one
and as thou fairest art must cruelest be
or else with pity yield unto their moan
their moan that ever will importune thee
ah thou must be unkind and give denial
and i poor i must stand unto my trial


clip not sweet love the wings of my desire
although it soar aloft and mount too high
but rather bear with me though i aspire
for i have wings to bear me to the sky
what though i mount there is no sun but thee
and sith no other sun why should i fear
thou wilt not burn me though thou terrify
and though thy brightness do so great appear
dear i seek not to batter down thy glory
nor do i envy that thy hope increaseth
o never think thy fame doth make me sorry
for thou must live by fame when beauty ceaseth
besides since from one root we both did spring
why should not i thy fame and beauty sing


winged with sad woes why doth fair zephyr blow
upon my face the map of discontent
is it to have the weeds of sorrow grow
so long and thick that they will neer be spent
no fondling no it is to cool the fire
which hot desire within thy breast hath made
check him but once and he will soon retire
o but he sorrows brought which cannot fade
the sorrows that he brought he took from thee
which fair fidessa span and thou must wear
yet hath she nothing done of cruelty
but for her sake to try what thou wilt bear
come sorrows come you are to me assigned
ill bear you all it is fidessas mind


o if my heavenly sighs must prove annoy
which are the sweetest music to my heart
let it suffice i count them as my joy
sweet bitter joy and pleasant painful smart
for when my breast is clogged with thousand cares
that my poor loaded heart is like to break
then every sigh doth question how it fares
seeming to add their strength which makes me weak
yet for they friendly are i entertain them
and they too well are pleased with their host
but i had not fidessa been ere now had slain them
its for her cause they live in her they boast
they promise help but when they see her face
they fainting yield and dare not sue for grace


compare me to the child that plays with fire
or to the fly that dieth in the flame
or to the foolish boy that did aspire
to touch the glory of high heavens frame
compare me to leander struggling in the waves
not able to attain his safetys shore
or to the sick that do expect their graves
or to the captive crying evermore
compare me to the weeping wounded hart
moaning with tears the period of his life
or to the boar that will not feel the smart
when he is stricken with the butchers knife
no man to these can fitly me compare
these live to die i die to live in care


when silent sleep had closed up mine eyes
my watchful mind did then begin to muse
a thousand pleasing thoughts did then arise
that sought by slights their master to abuse
i saw o heavenly sight fidessas face
and fair dame nature blushing to behold it
now did she laugh now wink now smile apace
she took me by the hand and fast did hold it
sweetly her sweet body did she lay down by me
alas poor wretch quoth she great is thy sorrow
but thou shall comfort find if thou wilt try me
i hope sir boy youll tell me news tomorrow
with that away she went and i did wake withal
when ah my honey thoughts were turned to gall


carecharmer sleep sweet ease in restless misery
the captives liberty and his freedoms song
balm of the bruised heart mans chief felicity
brother of quiet death when life is too too long
a comedy it is and now an history
what is not sleep unto the feeble mind
it easeth him that toils and him thats sorry
it makes the deaf to hear to see the blind
ungentle sleep thou helpest all but me
for when i sleep my soul is vexed most
it is fidessa that doth master thee
if she approach alas thy power is lost
but here she is see how he runs amain
i fear at night he will not come again


for i have loved long i crave reward
reward me not unkindly think on kindness
kindness becometh those of high regard
regard with clemency a poor mans blindness
blindness provokes to pity when it crieth
it crieth give dear lady shew some pity
pity or let him die that daily dieth
dieth he not oft who often sings this ditty
this ditty pleaseth me although it choke me
methinks dame echo weepeth at my moaning
moaning the woes that to complain provoke me
provoke me now no more but hear my groaning
groaning both day and night doth tear my heart
my heart doth know the cause and triumphs in the smart


sweet strokeso might i thrive as i must praise
but sweeter hand that gives so sweet a stroke
the lute itself is sweetest when she plays
but what hear i a string through fear is broke
the lute doth shake as if it were afraid
o sure some goddess holds it in her hand
a heavenly power that oft hath me dismayed
yet such a power as doth in beauty stand
cease lute my ceaseless suit will neer be heard
ah too hardhearted she that will not hear it
if i but think on joy my joy is marred
my grief is great yet ever must i bear it
but love twixt us will prove a faithful page
and she will love my sorrows to assuage


o she must love my sorrows to assuage
o god what joy felt i when she did smile
whom killing grief before did cause to rage
beauty is able sorrow to beguile
out traitor absence thou dost hinder me
and makst my mistress often to forget
causing me to rail upon her cruelty
whilst thou my suit injuriously dost let
again her presence doth astonish me
and strikes me dumb as if my sense were gone
oh is not this a strange perplexity
in presence dumb she hears not absent moan
thus absent presence present absence maketh
that hearing my poor suit she it mistaketh


my pain paints out my love in doleful verse
the lively glass wherein she may behold it
my verse her wrong to me doth still rehearse
but so as it lamenteth to unfold it
myself with ceaseless tears my harms bewail
and her obdurate heart not to be moved
though longcontinued woes my senses fail
and curse the day the hour when first i loved
she takes the glass wherein herself she sees
in bloody colours cruelly depainted
and her poor prisoner humbly on his knees
pleading for grace with heart that never fainted
she breaks the glass alas i cannot choose
but grieve that i should so my labour lose


great is the joy that no tongue can express
fair babe new born how much dost thou delight me
but what is mine so great yea no whit less
so great that of all woes it doth acquite me
its fair fidessa that this comfort bringeth
who sorry for the wrongs by her procured
delightful tunes of love of true love singeth
wherewith her too chaste thoughts were neer inured
she loves she saith but with a love not blind
her love is counsel that i should not love
but upon virtues fix a stayed mind
but what this newcoined love love doth reprove
if this be love of which you make such store
sweet love me less that you may love me more


he that will caesar be or else not be
who can aspire to caesars bleeding fame
must be of high resolve but what is he
that thinks to gain a second caesars name
whoeer he be that climbs above his strength
and climbeth high the greater is his fall
for though he sit awhile we see at length
his slippery place no firmness hath at all
great is his bruise that falleth from on high
this warneth me that i should not aspire
examples should prevail i care not i
i perish must or have what i desire
this humour doth with mine full well agree
i must fidessas be or else not be


it was of love ungentle gentle boy
that thou didst come and harbour in my breast
not of intent my body to destroy
and have my soul with restless cares opprest
but sith thy love doth turn unto my pain
return to greece sweet lad where thou wast born
leave me alone my griefs to entertain
if thou forsake me i am less forlorn
although alone yet shall i find more ease
then see thou hie thee hence or i will chase thee
men highly wronged care not to displease
my fortune hangs on thee thou dost disgrace me
yet at thy farewell play a friendly part
to make amends fly to fidessas heart


fly to her heart hover about her heart
with dainty kisses mollify her heart
pierce with thy arrows her obdurate heart
with sweet allurements ever move her heart
at midday and at midnight touch her heart
be lurking closely nestle about her heart
with powerthou art a godcommand her heart
kindle thy coals of love about her heart
yea even into thyself transform her heart
ah she must love be sure thou have her heart
and i must die if thou have not her heart
thy bed if thou rest well must be her heart
he hath the best part sure that hath her heart
what have i not if i have but her heart


striving is past ah i must sink and drown
and that in sight of long descried shore
i cannot send for aid unto the town
all help is vain and i must die therefore
then poor distressed caitiff be resolved
to leave this earthly dwelling fraught with care
cease will thy woes thy corpse in earth involved
thou diest for her that will no help prepare
o see my case herself doth now behold
the casement open is she seems to speak
but she has gone o then i dare be bold
and needs must say she caused my heart to break
i die before i drown o heavy case
it was because i saw my mistress face


compare me to pygmalion with his image sotted
for as was he even so am i deceived
the shadow only is to me allotted
the substance hath of substance me bereaved
then poor and helpless must i wander still
in deep laments to pass succeeding days
weltring in woes that poor and mighty kill
o who is mighty that so soon decays
the dread almighty hath appointed so
the final period of all worldly things
then as in time they come so must they go
death common is to beggars and to kings
for whither do i run beside my text
i run to death for death must be the next


the silly bird that hastes unto the net
and flutters to and fro till she be taken
doth look some food or succour there to get
but loseth life so much is she mistaken
the foolish fly that fleeth to the flame
with ceaseless hovering and with restless flight
is burned straight to ashes in the same
and finds her death where was her most delight
the proud aspiring boy that needs would pry
into the secrets of the highest seat
had some conceit to gain content thereby
or else his folly sure was wondrous great
these did through folly perish all and die
and though i know it even so do i


poor worm poor silly worm alas poor beast
fear makes thee hide thy head within the ground
because of creeping things thou art the least
yet every foot gives thee thy mortal wound
but i thy fellow worm am in worse state
for thou thy sun enjoyest but i want mine
i live in irksome night o cruel fate
my sun will never rise nor ever shine
thus blind of light mine eyes misguide my feet
and baleful darkness makes me still afraid
men mock me when i stumble in the street
and wonder how my young sight so decayed
yet do i joy in this even when i fall
that i shall see again and then see all


well may my soul immortal and divine
that is imprisoned in a lump of clay
breathe out laments until this body pine
that from her takes her pleasures all away
pine then thou loathed prison of my life
untoward subject of the least aggrievance
o let me die mortality is rife
death comes by wounds by sickness care and chance
o earth the time will come when ill resume thee
and in thy bosom make my restingplace
then do not unto hardest sentence doom me
yield yield betimes i must and will have grace
richly shalt thou be entombed since for thy grave
fidessa fair fidessa thou shalt have


earth take this earth wherein my spirits languish
spirits leave this earth that doth in griefs retain you
griefs chase this earth that it may fade with anguish
spirits avoid these furies which do pain you
o leave your loathsome prison freedom gain you
your essence is divine great is your power
and yet you moan your wrongs and sore complain you
hoping for joy which fadeth every hour
o spirits your prison loathe and freedom gain you
the destinies in deep laments have shut you
of mortal hate because they do disdain you
and yet of joy that they in prison put you
earth take this earth with thee to be enclosed
life is to me and i to it opposed


weep now no more mine eyes but be you drowned
in your own tears so many years distilled
and let her know that at them long hath frowned
that you can weep no more although she willed
this hap her cruelty hath her allotten
who whilom was commandress of each part
that now her proper griefs must be forgotten
by those true outward signs of inward smart
for how can he that hath not one tear left him
stream out those floods that are due unto her moaning
when both of eyes and tears she hath bereft him
o yet ill signify my grief with groaning
true sighs true groans shall echo in the air
and say fidessa though most cruel is most fair


tongue never cease to sing fidessas praise
heart however she deserve conceive the best
eyes stand amazed to see her beautys rays
lips steal one kiss and be for ever blest
hands touch that hand wherein your life is closed
breast lock up fast in thee thy lifes sole treasure
arms still embrace and never be disclosed
feet run to her without or pace or measure
tongue heart eyes lips hands breast arms feet
consent to do true homage to your queen
lovely fair gentle wise virtuous sober sweet
whose like shall never be hath never been
o that i were all tongue her praise to shew
then surely my poor heart were freed from woe


sore sick of late nature her due would have
great was my pain where still my mind did rest
no hope but heaven no comfort but my grave
which is of comforts both the last and least
but on a sudden the almighty sent
sweet ease to the distressed and comfortless
and gave me longer time for to repent
with health and strength the foes of feebleness
yet i my health no sooner gan recover
but my old thoughts though full of cares retained
made me as erst become a wretched lover
of her that love and lovers aye disdained
then was my pain with ease of pain increased
and i neer sick until my sickness ceased


he that would fain fidessas image see
my face of force may be his lookingglass
there is she portrayed and her cruelty
which as a wonder through the world must pass
but were i dead she would not be betrayed
its i that gainst my will shall make it known
her cruelty by me must be bewrayed
or i must hide my head and live alone
ill pluck my silver hairs from out my head
and wash away the wrinkles of my face
closely immured ill live as i were dead
before she suffer but the least disgrace
how can i hide that is already known
i have been seen and have no face but one


fie pleasure fie thou cloyst me with delight
sweet thoughts you kill me if you lower stray
o many be the joys of one short night
tush fancies never can desire allay
happy unhappy thoughts i think and have not
pleasure o pleasing pain shows nought avail me
mine own conceit doth glad me more i crave not
yet wanting substance woe doth still assail me
babies do children please and shadows fools
shows have deceived the wisest many a time
ever to want our wish our courage cools
the ladder broken tis in vain to climb
but i must wish and crave and seek and climb
its hard if i obtain not grace in time


i have not spent the april of my time
the sweet of youth in plotting in the air
but do at first adventure seek to climb
whilst flowers of blooming years are green and fair
i am no leaving of allwithering age
i have not suffered many winter lours
i feel no storm unless my love do rage
and then in grief i spend both days and hours
this yet doth comfort that my flower lasted
until it did approach my sun too near
and then alas untimely was it blasted
so soon as once thy beauty did appear
but after all my comfort rests in this
that for thy sake my youth decayed is


o let my heart my body and my tongue
bleed forth the lively streams of faith unfeigned
worship my saint the gods and saints among
praise and extol her fair that me hath pained
o let the smoke of my suppressed desire
raked up in ashes of my burning breast
break out at length and to the clouds aspire
urging the heavens to afford me rest
but let my body naturally descend
into the bowels of our common mother
and to the very centre let it wend
when it no lower can her griefs to smother
and yet when i so low do buried lie
then shall my love ascend unto the sky


fair is my love that feeds among the lilies
the lilies growing in that pleasant garden
where cupids mount that well beloved hill is
and where that little god himself is warden
see where my love sits in the beds of spices
beset all round with camphor myrrh and roses
and interlaced with curious devices
which her from all the world apart incloses
there doth she tune her lute for her delight
and with sweet music makes the ground to move
whilst i poor i do sit in heavy plight
wailing alone my unrespected love
not daring rush into so rare a place
that gives to her and she to it a grace


was never eye did see my mistress face
was never ear did hear fidessas tongue
was never mind that once did mind her grace
that ever thought the travail to be long
when her i see no creature i behold
so plainly say these advocates of love
that now do fear and now to speak are bold
trembling apace when they resolve to prove
these strange effects do show a hidden power
a majesty all base attempts reproving
that glads or daunts as she doth laugh or lower
surely some goddess harbours in their moving
who thus my muse from base attempts hath raised
whom thus my muse beyond compare hath praised


my ladys hair is threads of beaten gold
her front the purest crystal eye hath seen
her eyes the brightest stars the heavens hold
her cheeks red roses such as seld have been
her pretty lips of red vermillion die
her hand of ivory the purest white
her blush aurora or the morning sky
her breast displays two silver fountains bright
the spheres her voice her grace the graces three
her body is the saint that i adore
her smiles and favours sweet as honey be
her feet fair thetis praiseth evermore
but ah the worst and last is yet behind
for of a griffon she doth bear the mind


injurious fates to rob me of my bliss
and dispossess my heart of all his hope
you ought with just revenge to punish miss
for unto you the hearts of men are ope
injurious fates that hardened have her heart
yet make her face to send out pleasing smiles
and both are done but to increase my smart
and entertain my love with falsed wiles
yet being when she smiles surprised with joy
i fain would languish in so sweet a pain
beseeching death my body to destroy
lest on the sudden she should frown again
when men do wish for death fates have no force
but they when men would live have no remorse


the prison i am in is thy fair face
wherein my liberty enchained lies
my thoughts the bolts that hold me in the place
my food the pleasing looks of thy fair eyes
deep is the prison where i lie enclosed
strong are the bolts that in this cell contain me
sharp is the food necessity imposed
when hunger makes me feed on that which pains me
yet do i love embrace and follow fast
that holds that keeps that discontents me most
and list not break unlock or seek to waste
the place the bolts the food though i be lost
better in prison ever to remain
than being out to suffer greater pain


when neverspeaking silence proves a wonder
when everflying flame at home remaineth
when allconcealing night keeps darkness under
when mendevouring wrong true glory gaineth
when soultormenting grief agrees with joy
when lucifer foreruns the baleful night
when venus doth forsake her little boy
when her untoward boy obtaineth sight
when sisyphus doth cease to roll his stone
when otus shaketh off his heavy chain
when beauty queen of pleasure is alone
when love and virtue quiet peace disdain
when these shall be and i not be
then will fidessa pity me


tell me of love sweet love who is thy sire
or if thou mortal or immortal be
some say thou art begotten by desire
nourished with hope and fed with fantasy
engendered by a heavenly goddess eye
lurking most sweetly in an angels face
others that beauty thee doth deify
o sovereign beauty full of power and grace
but i must be absurd all this denying
because the fairest fair alive neer knew thee
now cupid comes thy godhead to the trying
twas she alonesuch is her powerthat slew me
she shall be love and thou a foolish boy
whose virtue proves thy power is but a toy


no choice of change can ever change my mind
choiceless my choice the choicest choice alive
wonder of women were she not unkind
the pitiless of pity to deprive
yet she the kindest creature of her kind
accuseth me of selfingratitude
and well she may sith by good proof i find
myself had died had she not helpful stood
for when my sickness had the upper hand
and death began to show his awful face
she took great pains my pains for to withstand
and eased my heart that was in heavy case
but cruel now she scorneth what it craveth
unkind in kindness murdering while she saveth


mine eye bewrays the secrets of my heart
my heart unfolds his grief before her face
her facebewitching pleasure of my smart
deigns not one look of mercy and of grace
my guilty eye of murder and of treason
friendly conspirator of my decay
dumb eloquence the lovers strongest reason
doth weep itself for anger quite away
and chooseth rather not to be than be
disloyal by too well discharging duty
and being out joys it no more can see
the sugared charms of all deceiving beauty
but for the other greedily doth eye it
i pray you tell me what do i get by it


so soon as peeping lucifer auroras star
the sky with golden periwigs doth spangle
so soon as phoebus gives us light from far
so soon as fowler doth the bird entangle
soon as the watchful bird clock of the morn
gives intimation of the days appearing
soon as the jolly hunter winds his horn
his speech and voice with customs echo clearing
soon as the hungry lion seeks his prey
in solitary range of pathless mountains
soon as the passenger sets on his way
so soon as beasts resort unto the fountains
so soon mine eyes their office are discharging
and i my griefs with greater griefs enlarging


i see i hear i feel i know i rue
my fate my fame my pain my loss my fall
mishap reproach disdain a crown her hue
cruel still flying false fair funeral
to cross to shame bewitch deceive and kill
my first proceedings in their flowing bloom
my worthless pen fast chained to my will
my erring life through an uncertain doom
my thoughts that yet in lowliness do mount
my heart the subject of her tyranny
what now remains but her severe account
of murders crying guilt foul butchery
she was unhappy in her cradle breath
that given was to be anothers death


murder o murder i can cry no longer
murder o murder is there none to aid me
life feeble is in force death is much stronger
then let me die that shame may not upbraid me
nothing is left me now but shame or death
i fear she feareth not foul murders guilt
nor do i fear to lose a servile breath
i know my blood was given to be spilt
what is this life but maze of countless strays
the enemy of true felicity
fitly compared to dreams to flowers to plays
o life no life to me but misery
of shame or death if thou must one
make choice of death and both are gone


my cruel fortunes clouded with a frown
lurk in the bosom of eternal night
my climbing thoughts are basely hauled down
my best devices prove but aftersight
poor outcast of the worlds exiled room
i live in wilderness of deep lament
no hope reserved me but a hopeless tomb
when fruitless life and fruitful woes are spent
shall phoebus hinder little stars to shine
or lofty cedar mushrooms leave to grow
sure mighty men at little ones repine
the rich is to the poor a common foe
fidessa seeing how the world doth go
joineth with fortune in my overthrow


when i the hooks of pleasure first devoured
which undigested threaten now to choke me
fortune on me her golden graces showered
o then delight did to delight provoke me
delight false instrument of my decay
delight the nothing that doth all things move
made me first wander from the perfect way
and fast entangled me in the snares of love
then my unhappy happiness at first began
happy in that i loved the fairest fair
unhappily despised a hapless man
thus joy did triumph triumph did despair
my conquest iswhich shall the conquest gain
fidessa author both of joy and pain


work work apace you blessed sisters three
in restless twining of my fatal thread
o let your nimble hands at once agree
to weave it out and cut it off with speed
then shall my vexed and tormented ghost
have quiet passage to the elysian rest
and sweetly over death and fortune boast
in everlasting triumphs with the blest
but ah too well i know you have conspired
a lingering death for him that loatheth life
as if with woes he never could be tired
for this you hide your alldividing knife
one comfort yet the heavens have assigned me
that i must die and leave my griefs behind me


it is some comfort to the wronged man
the wronger of injustice to upbraid
justly myself herein i comfort can
and justly call her an ungrateful maid
thus am i pleased to rid myself of crime
and stop the mouth of allreporting fame
counting my greatest cross the loss of time
and all my private grief her public shame
ah but to speak the truth hence are my cares
and in this comfort all discomfort resteth
my harms i cause her scandal unawares
thus love procures the thing that love detesteth
for he that views the glasses of my smart
must need report she hath a flinty heart


i was a king of sweet content at least
but now from out my kingdom banished
i was chief guest at fair dame pleasures feast
but now i am for want of succour famished
i was a saint and heaven was my rest
but now cast down into the lowest hell
vile caitiffs may not live among the blest
nor blessed men amongst cursed caitiffs dwell
thus am i made an exile of a king
thus choice of meats to want of food is changed
thus heavens loss doth hellish torments bring
self crosses make me from myself estranged
yet am i still the same but made another
then not the same alas i am no other


if great apollo offered as a dower
his burning throne to beautys excellence
if jove himself came in a golden shower
down to the earth to fetch fair io thence
if venus in the curled locks was tied
of proud adonis not of gentle kind
if tellus for a shepherds favour died
the favour cruel love to her assigned
if heavens winged herald hermes had
his heart enchanted with a country maid
if poor pygmalion was for beauty mad
if gods and men have all for beauty strayed
i am not then ashamed to be included
mongst those that love and be with love deluded


o no i dare not o i may not speak
yes yes i dare i can i must i will
then heart pour forth thy plaints and do not break
let never fancy manly courage kill
intreat her mildly words have pleasing charms
of force to move the most obdurate heart
to take relenting pity of my harms
and with unfeigned tears to wail my smart
is she a stock a block a stone a flint
hath she nor ears to hear nor eyes to see
if so my cries my prayers my tears shall stint
lord how can lovers so bewitched be
i took her to be beautys queen alone
but now i see she is a senseless stone


is trust betrayed doth kindness grow unkind
can beauty both at once give life and kill
shall fortune alter the most constant mind
will reason yield unto rebelling will
doth fancy purchase praise and virtue shame
may show of goodness lurk in treachery
hath truth unto herself procured blame
must sacred muses suffer misery
are women woe to men traps for their falls
differ their words their deeds their looks their lives
have lovers ever been their tennis balls
be husbands fearful of the chastest wives
all men do these affirm and so must i
unless fidessa give to me the lie


three playfellowssuch three were never seen
in venus courtupon a summers day
met altogether on a pleasant green
intending at some pretty game to play
they dian cupid and fidessa were
their wager beauty bow and cruelty
the conqueress the stakes away did bear
whose fortune then was it to win all three
fidessa which doth these as weapons use
to make the greatest heart her will obey
and yet the most obedient to refuse
as having power poor lovers to betray
with these she wounds she heals gives life and death
more power hath none that lives by mortal breath


o beauty siren kept with circes rod
the fairest good in seem but foulest ill
the sweetest plague ordained for man by god
the pleasing subject of presumptuous will
th alluring object of unstayed eyes
friended of all but unto all a foe
the dearest thing that any creature buys
and vainest too it serves but for a show
in seem a heaven and yet from bliss exiling
paying for truest service nought but pain
young mens undoing young and old beguiling
mans greatest loss though thought his greatest gain
true that all this with pain enough i prove
and yet most true i will fidessa love


do i unto a cruel tiger play
that preys on me as wolf upon the lambs
who fear the danger both of night and day
and run for succour to their tender dams
yet will i pray though she be ever cruel
on bended knee and with submissive heart
she is the fire and i must be the fuel
she must inflict and i endure the smart
she must she shall be mistress of her will
and i poor i obedient to the same
as fit to suffer death as she to kill
as ready to be blamed as she to blame
and for i am the subject of her ire
all men shall know thereby my love entire


o let me sigh weep wail and cry no more
or let me sigh weep wail cry more and more
yea let me sigh weep wail cry evermore
for she doth pity my complaints no more
than cruel pagan or the savage moor
but still doth add unto my torments more
which grievous are to me by so much more
as she inflicts them and doth wish them more
o let thy mercy merciless be never more
so shall sweet death to me be welcome more
than is to hungry beasts the grassy moor
as she that to affliction adds yet more
becomes more cruel by still adding more
weary am i to speak of this word more
yet never weary she to plague me more


fidessas worth in time begetteth praise
time praise praise fame fame wonderment
wonder fame praise time her worth do raise
to highest pitch of dread astonishment
yet time in time her hardened heart bewrayeth
and praise itself her cruelty dispraiseth
so that through praise alas her praise decayeth
and that which makes it fall her honour raiseth
most strange yet true so wonder wonder still
and follow fast the wonder of these days
for well i know all wonder to fulfil
her will at length unto my will obeys
meantime let others praise her constancy
and me attend upon her clemency


most true that i must fair fidessa love
most true that fair fidessa cannot love
most true that i do feel the pains of love
most true that i am captive unto love
most true that i deluded am with love
most true that i do find the sleights of love
most true that nothing can procure her love
most true that i must perish in my love
most true that she contemns the god of love
most true that he is snared with her love
most true that she would have me cease to love
most true that she herself alone is love
most true that though she hated i would love
most true that dearest life shall end with love


from clee to heaven the beacon burns
the shires have seen it plain
from north and south the sign returns
and beacons burn again


look left look right the hills are bright
the dales are light between
because tis fifty years tonight
that god has saved the queen


now when the flame they watch not towers
about the soil they trod
lads well remember friends of ours
who shared the work with god


to skies that knit their heartstrings right
to fields that bred them brave
the saviours come not home tonight
themselves they could not save


it dawns in asia tombstones show
and shropshire names are read
and the nile spills his overflow
beside the severns dead


we pledge in peace by farm and town
the queen they served in war
and fire the beacons up and down
the land they perished for


god save the queen we living sing
from height to height tis heard
and with the rest your voices ring
lads of the fiftythird


oh god will save her fear you not
be you the men youve been
get you the sons your fathers got
and god will save the queen


loveliest of trees the cherry now
is hung with bloom along the bough
and stands about the woodland ride
wearing white for eastertide


now of my threescore years and ten
twenty will not come again
and take from seventy springs a score
it only leaves me fifty more


and since to look at things in bloom
fifty springs are little room
about the woodlands i will go
to see the cherry hung with snow


leave your home behind lad
and reach your friends your hand
and go and luck go with you
while ludlow tower shall stand


oh come you home of sunday
when ludlow streets are still
and ludlow bells are calling
to farm and lane and mill


or come you home of monday
when ludlow market hums
and ludlow chimes are playing
the conquering hero comes


come you home a hero
or come not home at all
the lads you leave will mind you
till ludlow tower shall fall


and you will list the bugle
that blows in lands of morn
and make the foes of england
be sorry you were born


and you till trump of doomsday
on lands of morn may lie
and make the hearts of comrades
be heavy where you die


leave your home behind you
your friends by field and town
oh town and field will mind you
till ludlow tower is down


wake the silver dusk returning
up the beach of darkness brims
and the ship of sunrise burning
strands upon the eastern rims


wake the vaulted shadow shatters
trampled to the floor it spanned
and the tent of night in tatters
straws the skypavilioned land


up lad up tis late for lying
hear the drums of morning play
hark the empty highways crying
wholl beyond the hills away


towns and countries woo together
forelands beacon belfries call
never lad that trod on leather
lived to feast his heart with all


up lad thews that lie and cumber
sunlit pallets never thrive
morns abed and daylight slumber
were not meant for man alive


clay lies still but bloods a rover
breaths a ware that will not keep
up lad when the journeys over
therell be time enough to sleep


oh see how thick the goldcup flowers
are lying in field and lane
with dandelions to tell the hours
that never are told again
oh may i squire you round the meads
and pick you posies gay
twill do no harm to take my arm
you may young man you may


ah spring was sent for lass and lad
tis now the blood runs gold
and man and maid had best be glad
before the world is old
what flowers today may flower tomorrow
but never as good as new
suppose i wound my arm right round
tis true young man tis true


some lads there are tis shame to say
that only court to thieve
and once they bear the bloom away
tis little enough they leave
then keep your heart for men like me
and safe from trustless chaps
my love is true and all for you
perhaps young man perhaps


oh look in my eyes then can you doubt
why tis a mile from town
how green the grass is all about
we might as well sit down
ah life what is it but a flower
why must true lovers sigh
be kind have pity my own my pretty
goodbye young man goodbye


when the lad for longing sighs
mute and dull of cheer and pale
if at deaths own door he lies
maiden you can heal his ail


lovers ills are all to buy
the wan look the hollow tone
the hung head the sunken eye
you can have them for your own


buy them buy them eve and morn
lovers ills are all to sell
then you can lie down forlorn
but the lover will be well


when smoke stood up from ludlow
and mist blew off from teme
and blithe afield to ploughing
against the morning beam
i strode beside my team


the blackbird in the coppice
looked out to see me stride
and hearkened as i whistled
the tramping team beside
and fluted and replied


lie down lie down young yeoman
what use to rise and rise
rise man a thousand mornings
yet down at last he lies
and then the man is wise


i heard the tune he sang me
and spied his yellow bill
i picked a stone and aimed it
and threw it with a will
then the bird was still


then my soul within me
took up the blackbirds strain
and still beside the horses
along the dewy lane
it sang the song again


lie down lie down young yeoman
the sun moves always west
the road one treads to labour
will lead one home to rest
and that will be the best


farewell to barn and stack and tree
farewell to severn shore
terence look your last at me
for i come home no more


the sun burns on the halfmown hill
by now the blood is dried
and maurice amongst the hay lies still
and my knife is in his side


my mother thinks us long away
tis time the field were mown
she had two sons at rising day
tonight shell be alone


and heres a bloody hand to shake
and oh man heres goodbye
well sweat no more on scythe and rake
my bloody hands and i


i wish you strength to bring you pride
and a love to keep you clean
and i wish you luck come lammastide
at racing on the green


long for me the rick will wait
and long will wait the fold
and long will stand the empty plate
and dinner will be cold


on moonlit heath and lonesome bank
the sheep beside me graze
and yon the gallows used to clank
fast by the four cross ways


a careless shepherd once would keep
the flocks by moonlight there
and high amongst the glimmering sheep
the dead man stood on air


they hang us now in shrewsbury jail
the whistles blow forlorn
and trains all night groan on the rail
to men that die at morn


there sleeps in shrewsbury jail tonight
or wakes as may betide
a better lad if things went right
than most that sleep outside


and naked to the hangmans noose
the morning clocks will ring
a neck god made for other use
than strangling in a string


and sharp the link of life will snap
and dead on air will stand
heels that held up as straight a chap
as treads upon the land


so here ill watch the night and wait
to see the morning shine
when he will hear the stroke of eight
and not the stroke of nine


and wish my friend as sound a sleep
as lads i did not know
that shepherded the moonlit sheep
a hundred years ago


the sun at noon to higher air
unharnessing the silver pair
that late before his chariot swam
rides on the gold wool of the ram


so braver notes the stormcock sings
to start the rusted wheel of things
and brutes in field and brutes in pen
leap that the world goes round again


the boys are up the woods with day
to fetch the daffodils away
and home at noonday from the hills
they bring no dearth of daffodils


afield for palms the girls repair
and sure enough the palms are there
and each will find by hedge or pond
her waving silvertufted wand


in farm and field through all the shire
the eye beholds the hearts desire
ah let not only mine be vain
for lovers should be loved again


on your midnight pallet lying
listen and undo the door
lads that waste the light in sighing
in the dark should sigh no more
night should ease a lovers sorrow
therefore since i go tomorrow
pity me before


in the land to which i travel
the far dwelling let me say
once if here the couch is gravel
in a kinder bed i lay
and the breast the darnel smothers
rested once upon anothers
when it was not clay


when i watch the living meet
and the moving pageant file
warm and breathing through the street
where i lodge a little while


if the heats of hate and lust
in the house of flesh are strong
let me mind the house of dust
where my sojourn shall be long


in the nation that is not
nothing stands that stood before
there revenges are forgot
and the hater hates no more


lovers lying two and two
ask not whom they sleep beside
and the bridegroom all night through
never turns him to the bride


when i was oneandtwenty
i heard a wise man say
give crowns and pounds and guineas
but not your heart away
give pearls away and rubies
but keep your fancy free
but i was oneandtwenty
no use to talk to me


when i was oneandtwenty
i heard him say again
the heart out of the bosom
was never given in vain
tis paid with sighs a plenty
and sold for endless rue
and i am twoandtwenty
and oh tis true tis true


there pass the careless people
that call their souls their own
here by the road i loiter
how idle and alone


ah past the plunge of plummet
in seas i cannot sound
my heart and soul and senses
world without end are drowned


his folly has not fellow
beneath the blue of day
that gives to man or woman
his heart and soul away


there flowers no balm to sain him
from east of earth to west
thats lost for everlasting
the heart out of his breast


here by the labouring highway
with empty hands i stroll
seadeep till doomsday morning
lie lost my heart and soul


look not in my eyes for fear
they mirror true the sight i see
and there you find your face too clear
and love it and be lost like me
one the long nights through must lie
spent in stardefeated sighs
but why should you as well as i
perish gaze not in my eyes


a grecian lad as i hear tell
one that many loved in vain
looked into a forest well
and never looked away again
there when the turf in springtime flowers
with downward eye and gazes sad
stands amid the glancing showers
a jonquil not a grecian lad


it nods and curtseys and recovers
when the wind blows above
the nettle on the graves of lovers
that hanged themselves for love


the nettle nods the wind blows over
the man he does not move
the lover of the grave the lover
that hanged himself for love


twice a week the winter thorough
here stood i to keep the goal
football then was fighting sorrow
for the young mans soul


now in may time to the wicket
out i march with bat and pad
see the son of grief at cricket
trying to be glad


try i will no harm in trying
wonder tis how little mirth
keeps the bones of man from lying
on the bed of earth


oh when i was in love with you
then i was clean and brave
and miles around the wonder grew
how well did i behave


and now the fancy passes by
and nothing will remain
and miles around theyll say that i
am quite myself again


the time you won your town the race
we chaired you through the marketplace
man and boy stood cheering by
and home we brought you shoulderhigh


today the road all runners come
shoulderhigh we bring you home
and set you at your threshold down
townsman of a stiller town


smart lad to slip betimes away
from fields where glory does not stay
and early though the laurel grows
it withers quicker than the rose


eyes the shady night has shut
cannot see the record cut
and silence sounds no worse than cheers
after earth has stopped the ears


now you will not swell the rout
of lads that wore their honours out
runners whom renown outran
and the name died before the man


so set before its echoes fade
the fleet foot on the sill of shade
and hold to the low lintel up
the stilldefended challengecup


and round that earlylaurelled head
will flock to gaze the strengthless dead
and find unwithered on its curls
the garland briefer than a girls


oh fair enough are sky and plain
but i know fairer far
those are as beautiful again
that in the water are


the pools and rivers wash so clean
the trees and clouds and air
the like on earth was never seen
and oh that i were there


these are the thoughts i often think
as i stand gazing down
in act upon the cressy brink
to strip and dive and drown


but in the goldensanded brooks
and azure meres i spy
a silly lad that longs and looks
and wishes he were i


in summertime on bredon
the bells they sound so clear
round both the shires they ring them
in steeples far and near
a happy noise to hear


here of a sunday morning
my love and i would lie
and see the coloured counties
and hear the larks so high
about us in the sky


the bells would ring to call her
in valleys miles away
come all to church good people
good people come and pray
but here my love would stay


and i would turn and answer
among the springing thyme
oh peal upon our wedding
and we will hear the chime
and come to church in time


but when the snows at christmas
on bredon top were strown
my love rose up so early
and stole out unbeknown
and went to church alone


they tolled the one bell only
groom there was none to see
the mourners followed after
and so to church went she
and would not wait for me


the bells they sound on bredon
and still the steeples hum
come all to church good people
oh noisy bells be dumb
i hear you i will come


the street sounds to the soldiers tread
and out we troop to see
a single redcoat turns his head
he turns and looks at me


my man from sky to skys so far
we never crossed before
such leagues apart the worlds ends are
were like to meet no more


what thoughts at heart have you and i
we cannot stop to tell
but dead or living drunk or dry
soldier i wish you well


the lads in their hundreds to ludlow come in for the fair
theres men from the barn and the forge and the mill and the fold
the lads for the girls and the lads for the liquor are there
and there with the rest are the lads that will never be old


theres chaps from the town and the field and the till and the cart
and many to count are the stalwart and many the brave
and many the handsome of face and the handsome of heart
and few that will carry their looks or their truth to the grave


i wish one could know them i wish there were tokens to tell
the fortunate fellows that now you can never discern
and then one could talk with them friendly and wish them farewell
and watch them depart on the way that they will not return


but now you may stare as you like and theres nothing to scan
and brushing your elbow unguessedat and not to be told
they carry back bright to the coiner the mintage of man
the lads that will die in their glory and never be old


say lad have you things to do
quick then while your days at prime
quick and if tis work for two
here am i man nows your time


send me now and i shall go
call me i shall hear you call
use me ere they lay me low
where a mans no use at all


ere the wholesome flesh decay
and the willing nerve be numb
and the lips lack breath to say
no my lad i cannot come


this time of year a twelvemonth past
when fred and i would meet
we needs must jangle till at last
we fought and i was beat


so then the summer fields about
till rainy days began
rose harland on her sundays out
walked with the better man


the better man she walks with still
though now tis not with fred
a lad that lives and has his will
is worth a dozen dead


fred keeps the house all kinds of weather
and clays the house he keeps
when rose and i walk out together
stockstill lies fred and sleeps


along the fields as we came by
a year ago my love and i
the aspen over stile and stone
was talking to itself alone
oh who are these that kiss and pass
a country lover and his lass
two lovers looking to be wed
and time shall put them both to bed
but she shall lie with earth above
and he beside another love


and sure enough beneath the tree
there walks another love with me
and overhead the aspen heaves
its rainysounding silver leaves
and i spell nothing in their stir
but now perhaps they speak to her
and plain for her to understand
they talk about a time at hand
when i shall sleep with clover clad
and she beside another lad


is my team ploughing
that i was used to drive
and hear the harness jingle
when i was man alive


ay the horses trample
the harness jingles now
no change though you lie under
the land you used to plough


is football playing
along the river shore
with lads to chase the leather
now i stand up no more


ay the ball is flying
the lads play heart and soul
the goal stands up the keeper
stands up to keep the goal


is my girl happy
that i thought hard to leave
and has she tired of weeping
as she lies down at eve


ay she lies down lightly
she lies not down to weep
your girl is well contented
be still my lad and sleep


is my friend hearty
now i am thin and pine
and has he found to sleep in
a better bed than mine


yes lad i lie easy
i lie as lads would choose
i cheer a dead mans sweetheart
never ask me whose


high the vanes of shrewsbury gleam
islanded in severn stream
the bridges from the steepled crest
cross the water east and west


the flag of morn in conquerors state
enters at the english gate
the vanquished eve as night prevails
bleeds upon the road to wales


ages since the vanquished bled
round my mothers marriagebed
there the ravens feasted far
about the open house of war


when severn down to buildwas ran
coloured with the death of man
couched upon her brothers grave
the saxon got me on the slave


the sound of fight is silent long
that began the ancient wrong
long the voice of tears is still
that wept of old the endless ill


in my heart it has not died
the war that sleeps on severn side
they cease not fighting east and west
on the marches of my breast


here the truceless armies yet
trample rolled in blood and sweat
they kill and kill and never die
and i think that each is i


none will part us none undo
the knot that makes one flesh of two
sick with hatred sick with pain
stranglingwhen shall we be slain


when shall i be dead and rid
of the wrong my father did
how long how long till spade and hearse
put to sleep my mothers curse


tis spring come out to ramble
the hilly brakes around
for under thorn and bramble
about the hollow ground
the primroses are found


and theres the windflower chilly
with all the winds at play
and theres the lenten lily
that has not long to stay
and dies on easter day


and since till girls go maying
you find the primrose still
and find the windflower playing
with every wind at will
but not the daffodil


bring baskets now and sally
upon the springs array
and bear from hill and valley
the daffodil away
that dies on easter day


others i am not the first
have willed more mischief than they durst
if in the breathless night i too
shiver now tis nothing new


more than i if truth were told
have stood and sweated hot and cold
and through their reins in ice and fire
fear contended with desire


agued once like me were they
but i like them shall win my way
lastly to the bed of mould
where theres neither heat nor cold


but from my grave across my brow
plays no wind of healing now
and fire and ice within me fight
beneath the suffocating night


on wenlock edge the woods in trouble
his forest fleece the wrekin heaves
the gale it plies the saplings double
and thick on severn snow the leaves


twould blow like this through holt and hanger
when uricon the city stood
tis the old wind in the old anger
but then it threshed another wood


then twas before my time the roman
at yonder heaving hill would stare
the blood that warms an english yeoman
the thoughts that hurt him they were there


there like the wind through woods in riot
through him the gale of life blew high
the tree of man was never quiet
then twas the roman now tis i


the gale it plies the saplings double
it blows so hard twill soon be gone
today the roman and his trouble
are ashes under uricon


from far from eve and morning
and yon twelvewinded sky
the stuff of life to knit me
blew hither here am i


now for a breath i tarry
nor yet disperse apart
take my hand quick and tell me
what have you in your heart


speak now and i will answer
how shall i help you say
ere to the winds twelve quarters
i take my endless way


if truth in hearts that perish
could move the powers on high
i think the love i bear you
should make you not to die


sure sure if stedfast meaning
if single thought could save
the world might end tomorrow
you should not see the grave


this long and sureset liking
this boundless will to please
oh you should live for ever
if there were help in these


but now since all is idle
to this lost heart be kind
ere to a town you journey
where friends are ill to find


_ oh sick i am to see you will you never let me be
you may be good for something but you are not good for me
oh go where you are wanted for you are not wanted here _
and that was all the farewell when i parted from my dear


i will go where i am wanted to a lady born and bred
who will dress me free for nothing in a uniform of red
she will not be sick to see me if i only keep it clean
i will go where i am wanted for a soldier of the queen


i will go where i am wanted for the sergeant does not mind
he may be sick to see me but he treats me very kind
he gives me beer and breakfast and a ribbon for my cap
and i never knew a sweetheart spend her money on a chap


i will go where i am wanted where theres room for one or two
and the men are none too many for the work there is to do
where the standing line wears thinner and the dropping dead lie thick
and the enemies of england they shall see me and be sick


on the idle hill of summer
sleepy with the flow of streams
far i hear the steady drummer
drumming like a noise in dreams


far and near and low and louder
on the roads of earth go by
dear to friends and food for powder
soldiers marching all to die


east and west on fields forgotten
bleach the bones of comrades slain
lovely lads and dead and rotten
none that go return again


far the calling bugles hollo
high the screaming fife replies
gay the files of scarlet follow
woman bore me i will rise


white in the moon the long road lies
the moon stands blank above
white in the moon the long road lies
that leads me from my love


still hangs the hedge without a gust
still still the shadows stay
my feet upon the moonlit dust
pursue the ceaseless way


the world is round so travellers tell
and straight though reach the track
trudge on trudge on twill all be well
the way will guide one back


but ere the circle homeward hies
far far must it remove
white in the moon the long road lies
that leads me from my love


as through the wild green hills of wyre
the train ran changing sky and shire
and far behind a fading crest
low in the forsaken west
sank the highreared head of clee
my hand lay empty on my knee
aching on my knee it lay
that morning half a shire away
so many an honest fellows fist
had wellnigh wrung it from the wrist
hand said i since now we part
from fields and men we know by heart
from strangers faces strangers lands
hand you have held true fellows hands
be clean then rot before you do
a thing theyd not believe of you
you and i must keep from shame
in london streets the shropshire name
on banks of thames they must not say
severn breeds worse men than they
and friends abroad must bear in mind
friends at home they leave behind
oh i shall be stiff and cold
when i forget you hearts of gold
the land where i shall mind you not
is the land where alls forgot
and if my foot returns no more
to teme nor corve nor severn shore
luck my lads be with you still
by falling stream and standing hill
by chiming tower and whispering tree
men that made a man of me
about your work in town and farm
still youll keep my head from harm
still youll help me hands that gave
a grasp to friend me to the grave


the winds out of the west land blow
my friends have breathed them there
warm with the blood of lads i know
comes east the sighing air


it fanned their temples filled their lungs
scattered their forelocks free
my friends made words of it with tongues
that talk no more to me


their voices dying as they fly
thick on the wind are sown
the names of men blow soundless by
my fellows and my own


oh lads at home i heard you plain
but here your speech is still
and down the sighing wind in vain
you hollo from the hill


the wind and i we both were there
but neither long abode
now through the friendless world we fare
and sigh upon the road


tis time i think by wenlock town
the golden broom should blow
the hawthorn sprinkled up and down
should charge the land with snow


spring will not wait the loiterers time
who keeps so long away
so others wear the broom and climb
the hedgerows heaped with may


oh tarnish late on wenlock edge
gold that i never see
lie long high snowdrifts in the hedge
that will not shower on me


into my heart an air that kills
from yon far country blows
what are those blue remembered hills
what spires what farms are those


that is the land of lost content
i see it shining plain
the happy highways where i went
and cannot come again


in my own shire if i was sad
homely comforters i had
the earth because my heart was sore
sorrowed for the son she bore
and standing hills long to remain
shared their shortlived comrades pain
and bound for the same bourn as i
on every road i wandered by
trod beside me close and dear
the beautiful and deathstruck year
whether in the woodland brown
i heard the beechnut rustle down
and saw the purple crocus pale
flower about the autumn dale
or littering far the fields of may
ladysmocks ableaching lay
and like a skylit water stood
the bluebells in the azured wood


yonder lightening other loads
the seasons range the country roads
but here in london streets i ken
no such helpmates only men
and these are not in plight to bear
if they would anothers care
they have enough as tis i see
in many an eye that measures me
the mortal sickness of a mind
too unhappy to be kind
undone with misery all they can
is to hate their fellow man
and till they drop they needs must still
look at you and wish you ill


once in the wind of morning
i ranged the thymy wold
the worldwide air was azure
and all the brooks ran gold


there through the dews beside me
behold a youth that trod
with feathered cap on forehead
and poised a golden rod


with mien to match the morning
and gay delightful guise
and friendly brows and laughter
he looked me in the eyes


oh whence i asked and whither
he smiled and would not say
and looked at me and beckoned
and laughed and led the way


and with kind looks and laughter
and nought to say beside
we two went on together
i and my happy guide


across the glittering pastures
and empty upland still
and solitude of shepherds
high in the folded hill


by hanging woods and hamlets
that gaze through orchards down
on many a windmill turning
and fardiscovered town


with gay regards of promise
and sure unslackened stride
and smiles and nothing spoken
led on my merry guide


by blowing realms of woodland
with sunstruck vanes afield
and cloudled shadows sailing
about the windy weald


by valleyguarded granges
and silver waters wide
content at heart i followed
with my delightful guide


and like the cloudy shadows
across the country blown
we two face on for ever
but not we two alone


with the great gale we journey
that breathes from gardens thinned
borne in the drift of blossoms
whose petals throng the wind


buoyed on the heavenheard whisper
of dancing leaflets whirled
from all the woods that autumn
bereaves in all the world


and midst the fluttering legion
of all that ever died
i follow and before us
goes the delightful guide


with lips that brim with laughter
but never once respond
and feet that fly on feathers
and serpentcircled wand


when i meet the morning beam
or lay me down at night to dream
i hear my bones within me say
another night another day


when shall this slough of sense be cast
this dust of thoughts be laid at last
the man of flesh and soul be slain
and the man of bone remain


this tongue that talks these lungs that shout
these thews that hustle us about
this brain that fills the skull with schemes
and its humming hive of dreams


these today are proud in power
and lord it in their little hour
the immortal bones obey control
of dying flesh and dying soul


tis long till eve and morn are gone
slow the endless night comes on
and late to fulness grows the birth
that shall last as long as earth


wanderers eastward wanderers west
know you why you cannot rest
tis that every mothers son
travails with a skeleton


lie down in the bed of dust
bear the fruit that bear you must
bring the eternal seed to light
and morn is all the same as night


rest you so from trouble sore
fear the heat o the sun no more
nor the snowing winter wild
now you labour not with child


empty vessel garment cast
we that wore you long shall last
another night another day
so my bones within me say


therefore they shall do my will
today while i am master still
and flesh and soul now both are strong
shall hale the sullen slaves along


before this fire of sense decay
this smoke of thought blow clean away
and leave with ancient night alone
the stedfast and enduring bone


shot so quick so clean an ending
oh that was right lad that was brave
yours was not an ill for mending
twas best to take it to the grave


oh you had forethought you could reason
and saw your road and where it led
and early wise and brave in season
put the pistol to your head


oh soon and better so than later
after long disgrace and scorn
you shot dead the household traitor
the soul that should not have been born


right you guessed the rising morrow
and scorned to tread the mire you must
dusts your wages son of sorrow
but men may come to worse than dust


souls undone undoing others
long time since the tale began
you would not live to wrong your brothers
oh lad you died as fits a man


now to your grave shall friend and stranger
with ruth and some with envy come
undishonoured clear of danger
clean of guilt pass hence and home


turn safe to rest no dreams no waking
and here man heres the wreath ive made
tis not a gift thats worth the taking
but wear it and it will not fade


if it chance your eye offend you
pluck it out lad and be sound
twill hurt but here are salves to friend you
and many a balsam grows on ground


and if your hand or foot offend you
cut it off lad and be whole
but play the man stand up and end you
when your sickness is your soul


bring in this timeless grave to throw
no cypress sombre on the snow
snap not from the bitter yew
his leaves that live december through
break no rosemary bright with rime
and sparkling to the cruel clime
nor plod the winter land to look
for willows in the icy brook
to cast them leafless round him bring
no spray that ever buds in spring


but if the christmas field has kept
awns the last gleaner overstept
or shrivelled flax whose flower is blue
a single season never two
or if one haulm whose year is oer
shivers on the upland frore
oh bring from hill and stream and plain
whatever will not flower again
to give him comfort he and those
shall bide eternal bedfellows
where low upon the couch he lies
whence he never shall arise


here the hangman stops his cart
now the best of friends must part
fare you well for ill fare i
live lads and i will die


oh at home had i but stayed
prenticed to my fathers trade
had i stuck to plane and adze
i had not been lost my lads


then i might have built perhaps
gallowstrees for other chaps
never dangled on my own
had i but left ill alone


now you see they hang me high
and the people passing by
stop to shake their fists and curse
so tis come from ill to worse


here hang i and right and left
two poor fellows hang for theft
all the sames the luck we prove
though the midmost hangs for love


comrades all that stand and gaze
walk henceforth in other ways
see my neck and save your own
comrades all leave ill alone


make some day a decent end
shrewder fellows than your friend
fare you well for ill fare i
live lads and i will die


be still my soul be still the arms you bear are brittle
earth and high heaven are fixt of old and founded strong
think rathercall to thought if now you grieve a little
the days when we had rest o soul for they were long


men loved unkindness then but lightless in the quarry
i slept and saw not tears fell down i did not mourn
sweat ran and blood sprang out and i was never sorry
then it was well with me in days ere i was born


now and i muse for why and never find the reason
i pace the earth and drink the air and feel the sun
be still be still my soul it is but for a season
let us endure an hour and see injustice done


ay look high heaven and earth ail from the prime foundation
all thoughts to rive the heart are here and all are vain
horror and scorn and hate and fear and indignation
oh why did i awake when shall i sleep again


think no more lad laugh be jolly
why should men make haste to die
empty heads and tongues atalking
make the rough road easy walking
and the feather pate of folly
bears the falling sky


oh tis jesting dancing drinking
spins the heavy world around
if young hearts were not so clever
oh they would be young for ever
think no more tis only thinking
lays lads underground


in valleys of springs of rivers
by ony and teme and clun
the country for easy livers
the quietest under the sun


we still had sorrows to lighten
one could not be always glad
and lads knew trouble at knighton
when i was a knighton lad


by bridges that thames runs under
in london the town built ill
tis sure small matter for wonder
if sorrow is with one still


and if as a lad grows older
the troubles he bears are more
he carries his griefs on a shoulder
that handselled them long before


where shall one halt to deliver
this luggage id lief set down
not thames not teme is the river
nor london nor knighton the town


tis a long way further than knighton
a quieter place than clun
where doomsday may thunder and lighten
and little twill matter to one


loitering with a vacant eye
along the grecian gallery
and brooding on my heavy ill
i met a statue standing still
still in marble stone stood he
and stedfastly he looked at me
well met i thought the look would say
we both were fashioned far away
we neither knew when we were young
these londoners we live among


still he stood and eyed me hard
an earnest and a grave regard
what lad drooping with your lot
i too would be where i am not
i too survey that endless line
of men whose thoughts are not as mine
years ere you stood up from rest
on my neck the collar prest
years when you lay down your ill
i shall stand and bear it still
courage lad tis not for long
stand quit you like stone be strong
so i thought his look would say
and light on me my trouble lay
and i slept out in flesh and bone
manful like the man of stone


far in a western brookland
that bred me long ago
the poplars stand and tremble
by pools i used to know


there in the windless nighttime
the wanderer marvelling why
halts on the bridge to hearken
how soft the poplars sigh


he hears long since forgotten
in fields where i was known
here i lie down in london
and turn to rest alone


there by the starlit fences
the wanderer halts and hears
my soul that lingers sighing
about the glimmering weirs


the lad came to the door at night
when lovers crown their vows
and whistled soft and out of sight
in shadow of the boughs


i shall not vex you with my face
henceforth my love for aye
so take me in your arms a space
before the east is grey


when i from hence away am past
i shall not find a bride
and you shall be the first and last
i ever lay beside


she heard and went and knew not why
her heart to his she laid
light was the air beneath the sky
but dark under the shade


oh do you breathe lad that your breast
seems not to rise and fall
and here upon my bosom prest
there beats no heart at all


oh loud my girl it once would knock
you should have felt it then
but since for you i stopped the clock
it never goes again


oh lad what is it lad that drips
wet from your neck on mine
what is it falling on my lips
my lad that tastes of brine


oh like enough tis blood my dear
for when the knife has slit
the throat across from ear to ear
twill bleed because of it


under the stars the air was light
but dark below the boughs
the still air of the speechless night
when lovers crown their vows


with rue my heart is laden
for golden friends i had
for many a roselipt maiden
and many a lightfoot lad


by brooks too broad for leaping
the lightfoot boys are laid
the roselipt girls are sleeping
in fields where roses fade


westward on the highhilled plains
where for me the world began
still i think in newer veins
frets the changeless blood of man


now that other lads than i
strip to bathe on severn shore
they no help for all they try
tread the mill i trod before


there when hueless is the west
and the darkness hushes wide
where the lad lies down to rest
stands the troubled dream beside


there on thoughts that once were mine
day looks down the eastern steep
and the youth at morning shine
makes the vow he will not keep


far i hear the bugle blow
to call me where i would not go
and the guns begin the song
soldier fly or stay for long


comrade if to turn and fly
made a soldier never die
fly i would for who would not
tis sure no pleasure to be shot


but since the man that runs away
lives to die another day
and cowards funerals when they come
are not wept so well at home


therefore though the best is bad
stand and do the best my lad
stand and fight and see your slain
and take the bullet in your brain


you smile upon your friend today
today his ills are over
you hearken to the lovers say
and happy is the lover


tis late to hearken late to smile
but better late than never
i shall have lived a little while
before i die for ever


when i came last to ludlow
amidst the moonlight pale
two friends kept step beside me
two honest lads and hale


now dick lies long in the churchyard
and ned lies long in jail
and i come home to ludlow
amidst the moonlight pale


the starfilled seas are smooth tonight
from france to england strown
black towers above the portland light
the felonquarried stone


on yonder island not to rise
never to stir forth free
far from his folk a dead lad lies
that once was friends with me


lie you easy dream you light
and sleep you fast for aye
and luckier may you find the night
than ever you found the day


now hollow fires burn out to black
and lights are guttering low
square your shoulders lift your pack
and leave your friends and go


oh never fear man noughts to dread
look not left nor right
in all the endless road you tread
theres nothing but the night


the vane on hughley steeple
veers bright a farknown sign
and there lie hughley people
and there lie friends of mine
tall in their midst the tower
divides the shade and sun
and the clock strikes the hour
and tells the time to none


to south the headstones cluster
the sunny mounds lie thick
the dead are more in muster
at hughley than the quick
north for a soontold number
chill graves the sexton delves
and steepleshadowed slumber
the slayers of themselves


to north to south lie parted
with hughley tower above
the kind the singlehearted
the lads i used to love
and south or north tis only
a choice of friends one knows
and i shall neer be lonely
asleep with these or those


terence this is stupid stuff
you eat your victuals fast enough
there cant be much amiss tis clear
to see the rate you drink your beer
but oh good lord the verse you make
it gives a chap the bellyache
the cow the old cow she is dead
it sleeps well the horned head
we poor lads tis our turn now
to hear such tunes as killed the cow
pretty friendship tis to rhyme
your friends to death before their time
moping melancholy mad
come pipe a tune to dance to lad


why if tis dancing you would be
theres brisker pipes than poetry
say for what were hopyards meant
or why was burton built on trent
oh many a peer of england brews
livelier liquor than the muse
and malt does more than milton can
to justify gods ways to man
ale man ales the stuff to drink
for fellows whom it hurts to think
look into the pewter pot
to see the world as the worlds not
and faith tis pleasant till tis past
the mischief is that twill not last
oh i have been to ludlow fair
and left my necktie god knows where
and carried halfway home or near
pints and quarts of ludlow beer
then the world seemed none so bad
and i myself a sterling lad
and down in lovely muck ive lain
happy till i woke again
then i saw the morning sky
heigho the tale was all a lie
the world it was the old world yet
i was i my things were wet
and nothing now remained to do
but begin the game anew
therefore since the world has still
much good but much less good than ill
and while the sun and moon endure
lucks a chance but troubles sure
id face it as a wise man would
and train for ill and not for good
tis true the stuff i bring for sale
is not so brisk a brew as ale
out of a stem that scored the hand
i wrung it in a weary land
but take it if the smack is sour
the better for the embittered hour
it should do good to heart and head
when your soul is in my souls stead
and i will friend you if i may
in the dark and cloudy day
there was a king reigned in the east
there when kings will sit to feast
they get their fill before they think
with poisoned meat and poisoned drink
he gathered all that springs to birth
from the manyvenomed earth
first a little thence to more
he sampled all her killing store
and easy smiling seasoned sound
sate the king when healths went round
they put arsenic in his meat
and stared aghast to watch him eat
they poured strychnine in his cup
and shook to see him drink it up
they shook they stared as whites their shirt
them it was their poison hurt
i tell the tale that i heard told
mithridates he died old


i hoed and trenched and weeded
and took the flowers to fair
i brought them home unheeded
the hue was not the wear


so up and down i sow them
for lads like me to find
when i shall lie below them
a dead man out of mind


some seed the birds devour
and some the season mars
but here and there will flower
the solitary stars


and fields will yearly bear them
as lightleaved spring comes on
and luckless lads will wear them
when i am dead and gone


well to the woods no more
the laurels are all cut
the bowers are bare of bay
that once the muses wore
the year draws in the day
and soon will evening shut
the laurels all are cut
well to the woods no more
oh well no more no more
to the leafy woods away
to the high wild woods of laurel
and the bowers of bay no more


beyond the moor and mountain crest
comrade look not on the west
the sun is down and drinks away
from air and land the lees of day


the long cloud and the single pine
sentinel the ending line
and out beyond it clear and wan
reach the gulfs of evening on


the son of woman turns his brow
west from forty counties now
and as the edge of heaven he eyes
thinks eternal thoughts and sighs


oh wides the world to rest or roam
with change abroad and cheer at home
fights and furloughs talk and tale
company and beef and ale


but if i front the evening sky
silent on the west look i
and my comrade stride for stride
paces silent at my side


comrade look not on the west
twill have the heart out of your breast
twill take your thoughts and sink them far
leagues beyond the western bar


oh lad i fear that yons the sea
where they fished for you and me
and there from whence we both were taen
you and i shall drown again


send not on your soul before
to dive from that beguiling shore
and let not yet the swimmer leave
his clothes upon the sands of eve


too fast to yonder strand forlorn
we journey to the sunken bourn
to flush the fading tinges eyed
by other lads at eventide


wide is the world to rest or roam
and early tis for turning home
plant your heel on earth and stand
and lets forget our native land


when you and i are spilt on air
long we shall be strangers there
friends of flesh and bone are best
comrade look not on the west


as i gird on for fighting
my sword upon my thigh
i think on old ill fortunes
of better men than i


think i the round world over
what golden lads are low
with hurts not mine to mourn for
and shames i shall not know


what evil luck soever
for me remains in store
tis sure much finer fellows
have fared much worse before


so here are things to think on
that ought to make me brave
as i strap on for fighting
my sword that will not save


her strong enchantments failing
her towers of fear in wreck
her limbecks dried of poisons
and the knife at her neck


the queen of air and darkness
begins to shrill and cry
o young man o my slayer
tomorrow you shall die


o queen of air and darkness
i think tis truth you say
and i shall die tomorrow
but you shall die today


oh hard is the bed they have made him
and common the blanket and cheap
but there he will lie as they laid him
where else could you trust him to sleep


to sleep when the bugle is crying
and cravens have heard and are brave
when mothers and sweethearts are sighing
and lads are in love with the grave


oh dark is the chamber and lonely
and lights and companions depart
but lief will he lose them and only
behold the desire of his heart


and low is the roof but it covers
a sleeper content to repose
and far from his friends and his lovers
he lies with the sweetheart he chose


the queen she sent to look for me
the sergeant he did say
young man a soldier will you be
for thirteen pence a day


for thirteen pence a day did i
take off the things i wore
and i have marched to where i lie
and i shall march no more


my mouth is dry my shirt is wet
my blood runs all away
so now i shall not die in debt
for thirteen pence a day


tomorrow after new young men
the sergeant he must see
for things will all be over then
between the queen and me


and i shall have to bate my price
for in the grave they say
is neither knowledge nor device
nor thirteen pence a day


i listed at home for a lancer
oh who would not sleep with the brave
i listed at home for a lancer
to ride on a horse to my grave


and over the seas we were bidden
a country to take and to keep
and far with the brave i have ridden
and now with the brave i shall sleep


for round me the men will be lying
that learned me the way to behave
and showed me my business of dying
oh who would not sleep with the brave


they ask and there is not an answer
says i i will list for a lancer
oh who would not sleep with the brave


and i with the brave shall be sleeping
at ease on my mattress of loam
when back from their taking and keeping
the squadron is riding at home


the wind with the plumes will be playing
the girls will stand watching them wave
and eyeing my comrades and saying
oh who would not sleep with the brave


they ask and there is not an answer
says you i will list for a lancer
oh who would not sleep with the brave


in valleys green and still
where lovers wander maying
they hear from over hill
a music playing


behind the drum and fife
past hawthornwood and hollow
through earth and out of life
the soldiers follow


the soldiers is the trade
in any wind or weather
he steals the heart of maid
and man together


the lover and his lass
beneath the hawthorn lying
have heard the soldiers pass
and both are sighing


and down the distance they
with dying note and swelling
walk the resounding way
to the still dwelling


soldier from the wars returning
spoiler of the taken town
here is ease that asks not earning
turn you in and sit you down


peace is come and wars are over
welcome you and welcome all
while the charger crops the clover
and his bridle hangs in stall


now no more of winters biting
filth in trench from fall to spring
summers full of sweat and fighting
for the kesar or the king


rest you charger rust you bridle
kings and kesars keep your pay
soldier sit you down and idle
at the inn of night for aye


the chestnut casts his flambeaux and the flowers
stream from the hawthorn on the wind away
the doors clap to the pane is blind with showers
pass me the can lad theres an end of may


theres one spoilt spring to scant our mortal lot
one season ruined of our little store
may will be fine next year as like as not
oh ay but then we shall be twentyfour


we for a certainty are not the first
have sat in taverns while the tempest hurled
their hopeful plans to emptiness and cursed
whatever brute and blackguard made the world


it is in truth iniquity on high
to cheat our sentenced souls of aught they crave
and mar the merriment as you and i
fare on our long foolserrand to the grave


iniquity it is but pass the can
my lad no pair of kings our mothers bore
our only portion is the estate of man
we want the moon but we shall get no more


if here today the cloud of thunder lours
tomorrow it will hie on far behests
the flesh will grieve on other bones than ours
soon and the soul will mourn in other breasts


the troubles of our proud and angry dust
are from eternity and shall not fail
bear them we can and if we can we must
shoulder the sky my lad and drink your ale


could man be drunk for ever
with liquor love or fights
lief should i rouse at morning
and lief lie down at nights


but men at whiles are sober
and think by fits and starts
and if they think they fasten
their hands upon their hearts


yonder see the morning blink
the sun is up and up must i
to wash and dress and eat and drink
and look at things and talk and think
and work and god knows why


oh often have i washed and dressed
and whats to show for all my pain
let me lie abed and rest
ten thousand times ive done my best
and alls to do again


the laws of god the laws of man
he may keep that will and can
not i let god and man decree
laws for themselves and not for me
and if my ways are not as theirs
let them mind their own affairs
their deeds i judge and much condemn
yet when did i make laws for them
please yourselves say i and they
need only look the other way
but no they will not they must still
wrest their neighbour to their will
and make me dance as they desire
with jail and gallows and hellfire
and how am i to face the odds
of mans bedevilment and gods
i a stranger and afraid
in a world i never made
they will be master right or wrong
though both are foolish both are strong
and since my soul we cannot fly
to saturn nor to mercury
keep we must if keep we can
these foreign laws of god and man


what sound awakened me i wonder
for now tis dumb
wheels on the road most like or thunder
lie down twas not the drum


toil at sea and two in haven
and trouble far
fly crow away and follow raven
and all that croaks for war


hark i heard the bugle crying
and where am i
my friends are up and dressed and dying
and i will dress and die


oh love is rare and trouble plenty
and carrion cheap
and daylight dear at fourandtwenty
lie down again and sleep


reach me my belt and leave your prattle
your hour is gone
but my day is the day of battle
and that comes dawning on


they mow the field of man in season
farewell my fair
and call it truth or call it treason
farewell the vows that were


ay false heart forsake me lightly
tis like the brave
they find no bed to joy in rightly
before they find the grave


their love is for their own undoing
and east and west
they scour about the world awooing
the bullet to their breast


sail away the ocean over
oh sail away
and lie there with your leaden lover
for ever and a day


the night my father got me
his mind was not on me
he did not plague his fancy
to muse if i should be
the son you see


the day my mother bore me
she was a fool and glad
for all the pain i cost her
that she had borne the lad
that borne she had


my mother and my father
out of the light they lie
the warrant would not find them
and here tis only i
shall hang so high


oh let not man remember
the soul that god forgot
but fetch the county kerchief
and noose me in the knot
and i will rot


for so the game is ended
that should not have begun
my father and my mother
they had a likely son
and i have none


he stood and heard the steeple
sprinkle the quarters on the morning town
one two three four to marketplace and people
it tossed them down


strapped noosed nighing his hour
he stood and counted them and cursed his luck
and then the clock collected in the tower
its strength and struck


star and coronal and bell
april underfoot renews
and the hope of man as well
flowers among the morning dews


now the old come out to look
winter past and winters pains
how the sky in pool and brook
glitters on the grassy plains


easily the gentle air
wafts the turning season on
things to comfort them are there
though tis true the best are gone


now the scorned unlucky lad
rousing from his pillow gnawn
mans his heart and deep and glad
drinks the valiant air of dawn


half the night he longed to die
now are sown on hill and plain
pleasures worth his while to try
ere he longs to die again


blue the sky from east to west
arches and the world is wide
though the girl he loves the best
rouses from anothers side


the wain upon the northern steep
descends and lifts away
oh i will sit me down and weep
for bones in africa


for pay and medals name and rank
things that he has not found
he hove the cross to heaven and sank
the polestar underground


and now he does not even see
signs of the nadir roll
at night over the ground where he
is buried with the pole


the rain it streams on stone and hillock
the boot clings to the clay
since all is done thats due and right
lets home and now my lad goodnight
for i must turn away


goodnight my lad for noughts eternal
no league of ours for sure
tomorrow i shall miss you less
and ache of heart and heaviness
are things that time should cure


over the hill the highway marches
and whats beyond is wide
oh soon enough will pine to nought
remembrance and the faithful thought
that sits the grave beside


the skies they are not always raining
nor grey the twelvemonth through
and i shall meet good days and mirth
and range the lovely lands of earth
with friends no worse than you


but oh my man the house is fallen
that none can build again
my man how full of joy and woe
your mother bore you years ago
tonight to lie in the rain


in midnights of november
when dead mans fair is nigh
and danger in the valley
and anger in the sky


around the huddling homesteads
the leafless timber roars
and the dead call the dying
and finger at the doors


oh yonder faltering fingers
are hands i used to hold
their false companion drowses
and leaves them in the cold


oh to the bed of ocean
to africk and to ind
i will arise and follow
along the rainy wind


the night goes out and under
with all its train forlorn
hues in the east assemble
and cocks crow up the morn


the living are the living
and dead the dead will stay
and i will sort with comrades
that face the beam of day


the night is freezing fast
tomorrow comes december
and winterfalls of old
are with me from the past
and chiefly i remember
how dick would hate the cold


fall winter fall for he
prompt hand and headpiece clever
has woven a winter robe
and made of earth and sea
his overcoat for ever
and wears the turning globe


the fairies break their dances
and leave the printed lawn
and up from india glances
the silver sail of dawn


the candles burn their sockets
the blinds let through the day
the young man feels his pockets
and wonders whats to pay


the sloe was lost in flower
the april elm was dim
that was the lovers hour
the hour for lies and him


if thorns are all the bower
if north winds freeze the fir
why tis anothers hour
the hour for truth and her


in the morning in the morning
in the happy field of hay
oh they looked at one another
by the light of day
in the blue and silver morning
on the haycock as they lay
oh they looked at one another
and they looked away


he is here uranias son
hymen come from helicon
god that glads the lovers heart
he is here to join and part
so the groomsman quits your side
and the bridegroom seeks the bride
friend and comrade yield you oer
to her that hardly loves you more


now the sun his skyward beam
has tilted from the ocean stream
light the indies laggard sun
happy bridegroom day is done
and the star from cbtas steep
calls to bed but not to sleep


happy bridegroom hesper brings
all desired and timely things
all whom morning sends to roam
hesper loves to lead them home
home return who him behold
child to mother sheep to fold
bird to nest from wandering wide
happy bridegroom seek your bride


pour it out the golden cup
given and guarded brimming up
safe through jostling markets borne
and the thicket of the thorn
folly spurned and danger past
pour it to the god at last


now to smother noise and light
is stolen abroad the wildering night
and the blotting shades confuse
path and meadow full of dews
and the high heavens that all control
turn in silence round the pole
catch the starry beams they shed
prospering the married bed
and breed the land that reared your prime
sons to stay the rot of time
all is quiet no alarms
nothing fear of nightly harms
safe you sleep on guarded ground
and in silent circle round
the thoughts of friends keep watch and ward
harnessed angels hand on sword


tis mute the word they went to hear on high dodona mountain
when winds were in the oakenshaws and all the cauldrons tolled
and mutes the midland navelstone beside the singing fountain
and echoes list to silence now where gods told lies of old


i took my question to the shrine that has not ceased from speaking
the heart within that tells the truth and tells it twice as plain
and from the cave of oracles i heard the priestess shrieking
that she and i should surely die and never live again


oh priestess what you cry is clear and sound good sense i think it
but let the screaming echoes rest and froth your mouth no more
tis true theres better boose than brine but he that drowns must drink it
and oh my lass the news is news that men have heard before


the king with half the east at heel is marched from lands of morning
their fighters drink the rivers up their shafts benight the air
and he that stands will die for nought and home theres no returning
the spartans on the seawet rock sat down and combed their hair


the halfmoon westers low my love
and the wind brings up the rain
and wide apart lie we my love
and seas between the twain


i know not if it rains my love
in the land where you do lie
and oh so sound you sleep my love
you know no more than i


the sigh that heaves the grasses
whence thou wilt never rise
is of the air that passes
and knows not if it sighs


the diamond tears adorning
thy low mound on the lea
those are the tears of morning
that weeps but not for thee


now dreary dawns the eastern light
and fall of eve is drear
and cold the poor man lies at night
and so goes out the year


little is the luck ive had
and oh tis comfort small
to think that many another lad
has had no luck at all


wake not for the worldheard thunder
not the chime that earthquakes toll
star may plot in heaven with planet
lightning rive the rock of granite
tempest tread the oakwood under
fear you not for flesh nor soul
marching fighting victory past
stretch your limbs in peace at last


stir not for the soldiers drilling
nor the fever nothing cures
throb of drum and timbals rattle
call but man alive to battle
and the fife with deathnotes filling
screams for blood but not for yours
times enough you bled your best
sleep on now and take your rest


sleep my lad the french are landed
londons burning windsors down
clasp your cloak of earth about you
we must man the ditch without you
march unled and fight shorthanded
charge to fall and swim to drown
duty friendship bravery oer
sleep away lad wake no more


i walked alone and thinking
and faint the night wind blew
and stirred on mounds at crossways
the flower of sinners rue


where the roads part they bury
him that his own hand slays
and so the weed of sorrow
springs at the four cross ways


by night i plucked it hueless
when morning broke twas blue
blue at my breast i fastened
the flower of sinners rue


it seemed a herb of healing
a balsam and a sign
flower of a heart whose trouble
must have been worse than mine


dead clay that did me kindness
i can do none to you
but only wear for breastknot
the flower of sinners rue


onward led the road again
through the sad uncoloured plain
under twilight brooding dim
and along the utmost rim
wall and rampart risen to sight
cast a shadow not of night
and beyond them seemed to glow
bonfires lighted long ago
and my dark conductor broke
silence at my side and spoke
saying you conjecture well
yonder is the gate of hell


ill as yet the eye could see
the eternal masonry
but beneath it on the dark
to and fro there stirred a spark
and again the sombre guide
knew my question and replied
at hell gate the damned in turn
pace for sentinel and burn


dully at the leaden sky
staring and with idle eye
measuring the listless plain
i began to think again
many things i thought of then
battle and the loves of men
cities entered oceans crossed
knowledge gained and virtue lost
cureless folly done and said
and the lovely way that led
to the slimepit and the mire
and the everlasting fire
and against a smoulder dun
and a dawn without a sun
did the nearing bastion loom
and across the gate of gloom
still one saw the sentry go
trim and burning to and fro
one for women to admire
in his finery of fire
something as i watched him pace
minded me of time and place
soldiers of another corps
and a sentry known before


ever darker hell on high
reared its strength upon the sky
and our footfall on the track
fetched the daunting echo back
but the soldier pacing still
the insuperable sill
nursing his tormented pride
turned his head to neither side
sunk into himself apart
and the hellfire of his heart
but against our entering in
from the drawbridge death and sun
rose to render key and sword
to their father and their lord
and the portress foul to see
lifted up her eyes on me
smiling and i made reply
met again my lass said i
then the sentry turned his head
looked and knew me and was ned


once he looked and halted straight
set his back against the gate
caught his musket to his chin
while the hive of hell within
sent abroad a seething hum
as of towns whose king is come
leading conquest home from far
and the captives of his war
and the car of triumph waits
and they open wide the gates
but across the entry barred
straddled the revolted guard
weaponed and accoutred well
from the arsenals of hell
and beside him sick and white
sin to left and death to right
turned a countenance of fear
on the flaming mutineer
over us the darkness bowed
and the anger in the cloud
clenched the lightning for the stroke
but the traitor musket spoke


and the hollowness of hell
sounded as its master fell
and the mourning echo rolled
ruin through his kingdom old
tyranny and terror flown
left a pair of friends alone
and beneath the nether sky
all that stirred was he and i


silent nothing found to say
we began the backward way
and the ebbing lustre died
from the soldier at my side
as in all his spruce attire
failed the everlasting fire
midmost of the homeward track
once we listened and looked back
but the city dusk and mute
slept and there was no pursuit


when i would muse in boyhood
the wild green woods among
and nurse resolves and fancies
because the world was young
it was not foes to conquer
nor sweethearts to be kind
but it was friends to die for
that i would seek and find


i sought them and i found them
the sure the straight the brave
the hearts i lost my own to
the souls i could not save
they braced their belts around them
they crossed in ships the sea
they sought and found six feet of ground
and there they died for me


when the eye of day is shut
and the stars deny their beams
and about the forest hut
blows the roaring wood of dreams


from deep clay from desert rock
from the sunk sands of the main
come not at my door to knock
hearts that loved me not again


sleep be still turn to your rest
in the lands where you are laid
in far lodgings east and west
lie down on the beds you made


in gross marl in blowing dust
in the drowned ooze of the sea
where you would not lie you must
lie you must and not with me


the orchards half the way
from home to ludlow fair
flowered on the first of may
in mays when i was there
and seen from stile or turning
the plume of smoke would show
where fires were burning
that went out long ago


the plum broke forth in green
the pear stood high and snowed
my friends and i between
would take the ludlow road
dressed to the nines and drinking
and light in heart and limb
and each chap thinking
the fair was held for him


between the trees in flower
new friends at fairtime tread
the way where ludlow tower
stands planted on the dead
our thoughts a long while after
they think our words they say
theirs nows the laughter
the fair the first of may


ay yonder lads are yet
the fools that we were then
for oh the sons we get
are still the sons of men
the sumless tale of sorrow
is all unrolled in vain
may comes tomorrow
and ludlow fair again


when first my way to fair i took
few pence in purse had i
and long i used to stand and look
at things i could not buy


now times are altered if i care
to buy a thing i can
the pence are here and heres the fair
but wheres the lost young man


to think that two and two are four
and neither five nor three
the heart of man has long been sore
and long tis like to be


west and away the wheels of darkness roll
days beamy banner up the east is borne
spectres and fears the nightmare and her foal
drown in the golden deluge of the morn


but over sea and continent from sight
safe to the indies has the earth conveyed
the vast and mooneclipsing cone of night
her towering foolscap of eternal shade


see in mid heaven the sun is mounted hark
the belfries tingle to the noonday chime
tis silent and the subterranean dark
has crossed the nadir and begins to climb


these in the day when heaven was falling
the hour when earths foundations fled
followed their mercenary calling
and took their wages and are dead


their shoulders held the sky suspended
they stood and earths foundations stay
what god abandoned these defended
and saved the sum of things for pay


oh stay at home my lad and plough
the land and not the sea
and leave the soldiers at their drill
and all about the idle hill
shepherd your sheep with me


oh stay with company and mirth
and daylight and the air
too full already is the grave
of fellows that were good and brave
and died because they were


when summers end is nighing
and skies at evening cloud
i muse on change and fortune
and all the feats i vowed
when i was young and proud


the weathercock at sunset
would lose the slanted ray
and i would climb the beacon
that looked to wales away
and saw the last of day


from hill and cloud and heaven
the hues of evening died
night welled through lane and hollow
and hushed the countryside
but i had youth and pride


and i with earth and nightfall
in converse high would stand
late till the west was ashen
and darkness hard at hand
and the eye lost the land


the year might age and cloudy
the lessening day might close
but air of other summers
breathed from beyond the snows
and i had hope of those


they came and were and are not
and come no more anew
and all the years and seasons
that ever can ensue
must now be worse and few


so heres an end of roaming
on eves when autumn nighs
the ear too fondly listens
for summers parting sighs
and then the heart replies


tell me not here it needs not saying
what tune the enchantress plays
in aftermaths of soft september
or under blanching mays
for she and i were long acquainted
and i knew all her ways


on russet floors by waters idle
the pine lets fall its cone
the cuckoo shouts all day at nothing
in leafy dells alone
and travellers joy beguiles in autumn
hearts that have lost their own


on acres of the seeded grasses
the changing burnish heaves
or marshalled under moons of harvest
stand still all night the sheaves
or beeches strip in storms for winter
and stain the wind with leaves


possess as i possessed a season
the countries i resign
where over elmy plains the highway
would mount the hills and shine
and full of shade the pillared forest
would murmur and be mine


for nature heartless witless nature
will neither care nor know
what strangers feet may find the meadow
and trespass there and go
nor ask amid the dews of morning
if they are mine or no


when lads were home from labour
at abdon under clee
a man would call his neighbour
and both would send for me
and where the light in lances
across the mead was laid
there to the dances
i fetched my flute and played


ours were idle pleasures
yet oh content we were
the young to wind the measures
the old to heed the air
and i to lift with playing
from tree and tower and steep
the light delaying
and flute the sun to sleep


the youth toward his fancy
would turn his brow of tan
and tom would pair with nancy
and dick step off with fan
the girl would lift her glances
to his and both be mute
well went the dances
at evening to the flute


wenlock edge was umbered
and bright was abdon burf
and warm between them slumbered
the smooth green miles of turf
until from grass and clover
the upshot beam would fade
and england over
advanced the lofty shade


the lofty shade advances
i fetch my flute and play
come lads and learn the dances
and praise the tune today
tomorrow mores the pity
away we both must hie
to air the ditty
and to earth i


if in that syrian garden ages slain
you sleep and know not you are dead in vain
nor even in dreams behold how dark and bright
ascends in smoke and fire by day and night
the hate you died to quench and could but fan
sleep well and see no morning son of man


but if the grave rent and the stone rolled by
at the right hand of majesty on high
you sit and sitting so remember yet
your tears your agony and bloody sweat
your cross and passion and the life you gave
bow hither out of heaven and see and save


when israel out of egypt came
safe in the sea they trod
by day in cloud by night in flame
went on before them god


he brought them with a stretched out hand
dryfooted through the foam
past sword and famine rock and sand
lust and rebellion home


i never over horeb heard
the blast of advent blow
no firefaced prophet brought me word
which way behoved me go


ascended is the cloudy flame
the mount of thunder dumb
the tokens that to israel came
to me they have not come


i see the country far away
where i shall never stand
the heart goes where no footstep may
into the promised land


the realm i look upon and die
another man will own
he shall attain the heaven that i
perish and have not known


but i will go where they are hid
that never were begot
to my inheritance amid
the nation that is not


for these of old the trader
unpearled the indian seas
the nations of the nadir
were diamondless for these


a people prone and haggard
beheld their lightnings hurled
all round like sinai staggered
the sceptreshaken world


but now their coins are tarnished
their towers decayed away
their kingdom swept and garnished
for haler kings than they


their arms the rust hath eaten
their statutes none regard
arabia shall not sweeten
their dust with all her nard


they cease from long vexation
their nights their days are done
the pale the perished nation
that never see the sun


from the old deepdusted annals
the years erase their tale
and round them race the channels
that take no second sail


o youth whose heart is right
whose loins are girt to gain
the helldefended height
where virtue beckons plain


who seest the stark array
and hast not stayed to count
but singly wilt assay
the manycannoned mount


well is thy war begun
endure be strong and strive
but think not o my son
to save thy soul alive


wilt thou be true and just
and clean and kind and brave
well but for all thou dost
be sure it shall not save


thou when the night falls deep
thou though the mount be won
high heart thou shalt but sleep
the sleep denied to none


others or ever thou
to scale those heights were sworn
and some achieved but now
they never see the morn


how shouldst thou keep the prize
thou wast not born for aye
content thee if thine eyes
behold it in thy day


o youth that wilt attain
on for thine hour is short
it may be thou shalt gain
the helldefended fort


the snows are fled away leaves on the shaws
and grasses in the mead renew their birth
the river to the riverbed withdraws
and altered is the fashion of the earth


the nymphs and graces three put off their fear
and unapparelled in the woodland play
the swift hour and the brief prime of the year
say to the soul thou wast not born for aye


thaw follows frost hard on the heel of spring
treads summer sure to die for hard on hers
comes autumn with his apples scattering
then back to wintertide when nothing stirs


but oh whateer the skyled seasons mar
moon upon moon rebuilds it with her beams
come we where tullus and where ancus are
and good aeneas we are dust and dreams


torquatus if the gods in heaven shall add
the morrow to the day what tongue has told
feast then thy heart for what thy heart has had
the fingers of no heir will ever hold


when thou descendest once the shades among
the stern assize and equal judgment oer
not thy long lineage nor thy golden tongue
no nor thy righteousness shall friend thee more


night holds hippolytus the pure of stain
diana steads him nothing he must stay
and theseus leaves pirithons in the chain
the love of comrades cannot take away


i to my perils
of cheat and charmer
came clad in armour
by stars benign
hope lies to mortals
and most believe her
but mans deceiver
was never mine


the thoughts of others
were light and fleeting
of lovers meeting
or luck or fame
mine were of trouble
and mine were steady
so i was ready
when trouble came


stars i have seen them fall
but when they drop and die
no star is lost at all
from all the starsown sky
the toil of all that be
helps not the primal fault
it rains into the sea
and still the sea is salt


give me a land of boughs in leaf
a land of trees that stand
where trees are fallen there is grief
i love no leafless land


alas the country whence i fare
it is where i would stay
and where i would not it is there
that i shall be for aye


and one remembers and forgets
but tis not found again
not though they hale in crimsoned nets
the sunset from the main


when green buds hang in the elm like dust
and sprinkle the lime like rain
forth i wander forth i must
and drink of life again
forth i must by hedgerow bowers
to look at the leaves uncurled
and stand in the fields where cuckooflowers
are lying about the world


the weeping pleiads wester
and the moon is under sea
from bourn to bourn of midnight
far sighs the rainy breeze


it sighs from a lost country
to a land i have not known
the weeping pleiads wester
and i lie down alone


the rainy pleiads wester
orion plunges prone
the stroke of midnight ceases
and i lie down alone


the rainy pleiads wester
and seek beyond the sea
the head that i shall dream of
and twill not dream of me


i promise nothing friends will part
all things may end for all began
and truth and singleness of heart
are mortal even as is man


but this unlucky love should last
when answered passions thin to air
eternal fate so deep has cast
its sure foundation of despair


i lay me down and slumber
and every morn revive
whose is the nightlong breathing
that keeps a man alive


when i was off to dreamland
and left my limbs forgot
who stayed at home to mind them
and breathed when i did not


i waste my time in talking
no heed at all takes he
my kind and foolish comrade
that breathes all night for me


the farms of home lie lost in even
i see far off the steeple stand
west and away from here to heaven
still is the land


there if i go no girl will greet me
no comrade hollo from the hill
no dog run down the yard to meet me
the land is still


the land is still by farm and steeple
and still for me the land may stay
there i was friends with perished people
and there lie they


tarry delight so seldom met
so sure to perish tarry still
forbear to cease or languish yet
though soon you must and will


by sestos town in heros tower
on heros heart leander lies
the signal torch has burned its hour
and sputters as it dies


beneath him in the nighted firth
between two continents complain
the seas he swam from earth to earth
and he must swim again


how clear how lovely bright
how beautiful to sight
those beams of morning play
how heaven laughs out with glee
where like a bird set free
up from the eastern sea
soars the delightful day


today i shall be strong
no more shall yield to wrong
shall squander life no more
days lost i know not how
i shall retrieve them now
now i shall keep the vow
i never kept before


ensanguining the skies
how heavily it dies
into the west away
past touch and sight and sound
not further to be found
how hopeless under ground
falls the remorseful day


bells in tower at evening toll
and the day forsakes the soul
soon will evenings self be gone
and the whispering night come on


blame not thou the blinded light
nor the whisper of the night
though the whispering night were still
yet the heart would counsel ill


delight it is in youth and may
to see the morn arise
and more delight to look all day
a lover in the eyes
oh maiden let your distaff be
and pace the flowery meads with me
and i will tell you lies


tis blithe to see the sunshine fail
and hear the land grow still
and listen till the nightingale
is heard beneath the hill
oh follow me where she is flown
into the leafy woods alone
and i will work you ill


the millstream now that noises cease
is all that does not hold its peace
under the bridge it murmurs by
and here are night and hell and i


who made the world i cannot tell
tis made and here i am in hell
my hand though now my knuckles bleed
i never soiled with such a deed


and so no doubt in time gone by
some have suffered more than i
who only spend the night alone
and strike my fist upon the stone


like mine the veins of these that slumber
leapt once with dancing fires divine
the blood of all this noteless number
ran red like mine


how still with every pulse in station
frost in the founts that used to leap
the put to death the perished nation
how sound they sleep


these too these veins which life convulses
wait but a while shall cease to bound
i with the ice in all my pulses
shall sleep as sound


the world goes none the lamer
for ought that i can see
because this cursed trouble
has struck my days and me


the stars of heaven are steady
the founded hills remain
though i to earth and darkness
return in blood and pain


farewell to all belongings
i won or bought or stole
farewell my lusty carcase
farewell my aery soul


oh worse remains for others
and worse to fear had i
than here at fourandtwenty
to lay me down and die


ho everyone that thirsteth
and hath the price to give
come to the stolen waters
drink and your soul shall live


come to the stolen waters
and leap the guarded pale
and pull the flower in season
before desire shall fail


it shall not last for ever
no more than earth and skies
but he that drinks in season
shall live before he dies


june suns you cannot store them
to warm the winters cold
the lad that hopes for heaven
shall fill his mouth with mould


crossing alone the nighted ferry
with the one coin for fee
whom on the wharf of lethe waiting
count you to find not me


the brisk fond lackey to fetch and carry
the true sickhearted slave
expect him not in the just city
and free land of the grave


stone steel dominions pass
faith too no wonder
so leave alone the grass
that i am under


all knots that lovers tie
are tied to sever
here shall your sweetheart lie
untrue for ever


yon flakes that fret the eastern sky
lead back my day of birth
the far widewandered hour when i
came crying upon earth


then came i crying and today
with heavier cause to plain
depart i into death away
not to be born again


good creatures do you love your lives
and have you ears for sense
here is a knife like other knives
that cost me eighteen pence


i need but stick it in my heart
and down will come the sky
and earths foundations will depart
and all you folk will die


to stand up straight and tread the turning mill
to lie flat and known nothing and be still
are the two trades of man and which is worse
i know not but i know that both are ill


he standing hushed a pace or two apart
among the bluebells of the listless plain
thinks and remembers how he cleansed his heart
and washed his hands in innocence in vain


from the wash the laundress sends
my collars home with ravelled ends
i must fit now these are frayed
my neck with new ones londonmade


homespun collars homespun hearts
wear to rags in foreign parts
mine at leasts as good as done
and i must get a london one


shake hands we shall never be friends alls over
i only vex you the more i try
alls wrong that ever ive done or said
and nought to help it in this dull head
shake hands heres luck goodbye


but if you come to a road where danger
or guilt or anguish or shames to share
be good to the lad that loves you true
and the soul that was born to die for you
and whistle and ill be there


because i liked you better
than suits a man to say
it irked you and i promised
to throw the thought away


to put the world between us
we parted stiff and dry
goodbye said you forget me
i will no fear said i


if here where clover whitens
the dead mans knoll you pass
and no tall flower to meet you
starts in the trefoiled grass


halt by the headstone naming
the heart no longer stirred
and say the lad that loved you
was one that kept his word


with seed the sowers scatter
the furrows as they go
poor lads tis little matter
how many sorts they sow
for only one will grow


the charlock on the fallow
will take the travellers eyes
and gild the ploughland sallow
with flowers before it dies
but twice twill not arise


the stinging nettle only
will still be found to stand
the numberless the lonely
the thronger of the land
the leaf that hurts the hand


it thrives come sun come showers
blow east blow west it springs
it peoples towns and towers
about the courts of kings
and touch it and it stings


on forelands high in heaven
tis many a year gone by
amidst the fall of even
would stand my friends and i
before our foolish faces
lay lands we did not see
our eyes were in the places
where we should never be


oh the pearl seas are yonder
the ambersanded short
shires where the girls are fonder
towns where the pots hold more
and here fret we and moulder
by grange and rick and shed
and every moon are older
and soon we shall be dead


heigho twas true and pity
but there we lads must stay
troy was a steepled city
but troy was far away
and round we turned lamenting
to homes we longed to leave
and silent hills indenting
the orange band of eve


i see the air benighted
and all the dusking dales
and lamps in england lighted
and evening wrecked on wales
and starry darkness paces
the road from sea to sea
and blots the foolish faces
of my poor friends and me


young is the blood that yonder
strides out the dusty mile
and breasts the hillside highway
and whistles loud the while
and vaults the stile


yet flesh now too has thornpricks
and shoulders carry care
even as in other seasons
when i and not my heir
was young and there


on miry meads in winter
the football sprang and fell
may stuck the land with wickets
for all the eye could tell
the world went well


yet well god knows it went not
god knows it went awry
for me one flowery maytime
it went so ill that i
designed to die


and if so long i carry
the lot that season marred
tis that the sons of adam
are not so evilstarred
as they are hard


young is the blood that yonder
succeeds to rick and fold
fresh are the form and favour
and new the minted mould
the thoughts are old


halfway for one commandment broken
the woman made her endless halt
and she today a glistering token
stands in the wilderness of salt
behind the vats of judgment brewing
thundered and thick the brimstone snowed
he to the hill of his undoing
pursued his road


here dead lie we because we did not choose
to live and shame the land from which we sprung
life to be sure is nothing much to lose
but young men think it is and we were young


i did not lose my heart in summers even
when roses to the moonrise burst apart
when plumes were under heel and lead was flying
in blood and smoke and flame i lost my heart


i lost it to a soldier and a foeman
a chap that did not kill me but he tried
that took the sabre straight and took it striking
and laughed and kissed his hand to me and died


by shores and woods and steeples
rejoicing hearts receive
poured on a hundred peoples
the farshed alms of eve


her hands are filled with slumber
for worldwide labourers worn
yet those are more in number
that know her not from morn


now who sees night for ever
he sees no happier sight
night and no moon and never
a star upon the night


my dreams are of a field afar
and blood and smoke and shot
there in their graves my comrades are
in my grave i am not


i too was taught the trade of man
and spelt the lesson plain
but they when i forgot and ran
remembered and remain


farewell to a name and a number
recalled again
to darkness and silence and slumber
in blood and pain


so ceases and turns to the thing
he was born to be
a soldier cheap to the king
and dear to me


so smothers in blood the burning
and flaming flight
of valour and truth returning
to dust and night


he looked at me with eyes i thought
i was not like to find
the voice he begged for pence with brought
another man to mind


oh no lad never touch your cap
it is not my halfcrown
you have it from a better chap
that long ago lay down


turn east and over thames to kent
and come to the seas brim
and find his everlasting tent
and touch your cap to him


when hes returned ill tell him oh
dear fellow i forgot
time was you would have cared to know
but now it matters not


i mourn you and you heed not how
unsaid the word must stay
last month was time enough but now
the news must keep for aye


oh many a month before i learn
will find me starting still
and listening as the days return
for him that never will


strange strange to think his blood is cold
and mine flows easy on
and that straight look that heart of gold
that grace that manhood gone


the word unsaid will stay unsaid
though there was much to say
last month was time enough hes dead
the news must keep for aye


i wake from dreams and turning
my vision on the height
i scan the beacons burning
about the fields of night


each in its stedfast station
inflaming heaven they flare
they sign with conflagration
the empty moors of air


the signalfires of warning
they blaze but none regard
and on through night to morning
the world runs ruinward


far known to sea and shore
foursquare and founded well
a thousand years it bore
and then the belfry fell
the steersman of triest
looked where his mark should be
but empty was the west
and venice under sea


from dusty wreck dispersed
its stature mounts amain
on surer foot than first
the belfry stands again
at tofall of the day
again its curfew tolls
and burdens far away
the green and sanguine shoals


it looks to north and south
it looks to east and west
it guides to lido mouth
the steersman of triest
andrea fare you well
venice farewell to thee
the tower that stood and fell
is not rebuilt in me


smooth between sea and land
is laid the yellow sand
and here through summer days
the seed of adam plays


here the child comes to found
his unremaining mound
and the grown lad to score
two names upon the shore


here on the level sand
between the sea and land
what shall i build or write
against the fall of night


tell me of runes to grave
that hold the bursting wave
or bastions to design
for longer date than mine


shall it be troy or rome
i fence against the foam
or my own name to stay
when i depart for aye


nothing too near at hand
planing the figure sand
effacing clean and fast
cities not built to last
and charms devised in vain
pours the confounding main


hearken landsmen hearken seamen
to the tale of grief and me
looking from the land of biscay
on the waters of the sea


looking from the land of biscay
over ocean to the sky
on the farbeholding foreland
paced at even grief and i
there as warm the west was burning
and the east uncoloured cold
down the waterway of sunset
drove to shore a ship of gold
gold of mast and gold of cordage
gold of sail to sight was she
and she glassed her ensign golden
in the waters of the sea


oh said i my friend and lover
take we now that ship and sail
outward in the ebb of hues and
steer upon the sunset trail
leave the night to fall behind us
and the clouding counties leave
help for you and me is yonder
in a haven west of eve


under hill she neared the harbour
till the gazer could behold
on the golden deck the steersman
standing at the helm of gold
man and ship and sky and water
burning in a single flame
and the mariner of ocean
he was calling as he came
from the highway of the sunset
he was shouting on the sea
landsman of the land of biscay
have you help for grief and me


when i heard i did not answer
i stood mute and shook my heat
son of earth and son of ocean
much we thought and nothing said
grief and i abode the nightfall
to the sunset grief and he
turned them from the land of biscay
on the waters of the sea


o thou that from thy mansion
through time and place to roam
dost send abroad thy children
and then dost call them home


that men and tribes and nations
and all thy hand hath made
may shelter them from sunshine
in thine eternal shade


we now to peace and darkness
and earth and thee restore
thy creature that thou madest
and wilt cast forth no more


goodnight ensured release
imperishable peace
have these for yours
while sea abides and land
and earths foundations stand
and heaven endures


when earths foundations flee
nor sky nor land nor sea
at all is found
content you let them burn
it is not your concern
sleep on sleep sound


lydians lords of hermus river
sifters of the golden loam
see you yet the lances quiver
and the hunt returning home


king the star that shuts the even
calls the sheep from tmolus down
home return the doves from heaving
and the prince to sardis town


from the hunting heavy laden
up the mysian road they ride
and the star that mates the maiden
leads his son to croesus side


lydians under stream and fountain
finders of the golden vein
riding from olympus mountain
lydians see you atys plain


king i see the phrygian stranger
and the guards in hunters trim
saviours of thy son from danger
them i see i see not him


lydians as the troop advances
it is eve and i am old
tell me why they trail their lances
washers of the sands of gold


i am old and day is ending
and the wildering night comes on
up the mysian entry wending
lydians lydians what is yon


hounds behind their master whining
huntsmen pacing dumb beside
on his breast the boarspear shining
home they bear his fathers pride


oh were he and i together
shipmates on the fleeted main
sailing through the summer weather
to the spoil of france or spain


oh were he and i together
locking hands and taking leave
low upon the trampled heather
in the battle lost at eve


now are he and i asunder
and asunder to remain
kingdoms are for others plunder
and content for other slain


when adam walked in eden young
happy tis writ was he
while high the fruit of knowledge hung
unbitten on the tree


happy was he the livelong day
i doubt tis written wrong
the heart of man for all they say
was never happy long


and now my feet are tired of rest
and here they will not stay
and the soul fevers in my breast
and aches to be away


it is no gift i tender
a loan is all i can
but do not scorn the lender
man gets no more from man


oh mortal man may borrow
what mortal man can lend
and twill not end tomorrow
though sure enough twill end


if death and time are stronger
a love may yet be strong
the world will last for longer
but this will last for long


here are the skies the planets seven
and all the starry train
content you with the mimic heaven
and on the earth remain


ask me no more for fear i should reply
others have held their tongues and so can i
hundreds have died and told no tale before
ask me no more for fear i should reply


how one was true and one was clean of stain
and one was braver than the heavens are high
and one was fond of me and all are slain
ask me no more for fear i should reply


he would not stay for me and who can wonder
he would not stay for me to stand and gaze
i shook his hand and tore my heart in sunder
and went with half my life about my ways


now to her lap the incestuous earth
the son she bore has taen
and other sons she brings to birth
but not my friend again


when the bells justle in the tower
the hollow night amid
then on my tongue the taste is sour
of all i ever did


oh on my breast in days hereafter
light the earth should lie
such weight to bear is now the air
so heavy hangs the sky


morning up the eastern stair
marches azuring the air
and the foot of twilight still
is stolen toward the western sill
blithe the maids go milking blithe
men in hayfields stone the scythe
all the lands alive around
except the churchyards idle ground
theres empty acres west and east
but aye tis gods that bears the least
this hopeless garden that they sow
with the seeds that never grow


they shall have breath that never were
but he that was shall have it neer
the unconceived and unbegot
shall look on heaven but he shall not
the heart with many wildfires lit
ice is not so cold as it
the thirst that rivers could not lay
a little dust has quenched for aye
and in a fathoms compass lie
thoughts much wider than the sky


stay if you list o passer by the way
yet night approaches better not to stay
i never sigh nor flush nor knit the brow
nor grieve to think how ill god made me now
here with one balm for many fevers found
whole of an ancient evil i sleep sound


oh turn not in from marching
to taverns on the way
the drought and thirst and parching
a little dust will lay
and take desire away


oh waste no words awooing
the soft sleep to your bed
she is not worth pursuing
you will so soon be dead
and death will serve instead


oh is it the jar of nations
the noise of a world run mad
the fleeing of earths foundations
yes yes lie quiet my lad


oh is it my country calling
and whom will my country find
to shore up the sky from falling
my business never you mind


oh is it the newsboys crying
lost battle retreat despair
and honour and england dying
well fightingcock what if it were


the devil this side of the darnels
is having a dance with man
and quarrelsome chaps in charnels
must bear it as best they can


tis five years since an end said i
ill march no further time to die
alls lost no worse has heaven to give
worse has it given and yet i live


i shall not die today no fear
i shall live yet for many a year
and see worse ills and worse again
and die of age and not of pain


when god would rear from earth aloof
the blue height of the hollow roof
he sought him pillars sure and strong
and ere he found them sought them long


the stark steel splintered from the thrust
the basalt mountain sprang to dust
the blazing pier of diamond flawed
in shards of rainbow all abroad


what found he that the heavens stand fast
what pillar proven firm at last
bears up so light that worldseen span
the heart of man the heart of man


some can gaze and not be sick
but i could never learn the trick
theres this to say for blood and breath
they give a man a taste for death


the stars have not dealt me the worst they could do
my pleasures are plenty my troubles are two
but oh my two troubles they reave me of rest
the brains in my head and the heart in my breast


oh grant me the ease that is granted so free
the birthright of multitudes give it to me
that relish their victuals and rest on their bed
with flint in the bosom and guts in the head


oh who is that young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists
and what has he been after that they groan and shake their fists
and wherefore is he wearing such a consciencestricken air
oh theyre taking him to prison for the colour of his hair


tis a shame to human nature such a head of hair as his
in the good old time twas hanging for the colour that it is
though hanging isnt bad enough and flaying would be fair
for the nameless and abominable colour of his hair


oh a deal of pains hes taken and a pretty price hes paid
to hide his poll or dye it of a mentionable shade
but theyve pulled the beggars hat off for the world to see and stare
and theyre haling him to justice for the colour of his hair


now tis oakum for his fingers and the treadmill for his feet
and the quarrygang on portland in the cold and in the heat
and between his spells of labour in the time he has to spare
he can curse the god that made him for the colour of his hair


in battles of no renown
my fellows and i fell down
and over the dead men roar
the battles they lost before


the thunderstruck flagstaffs fall
the earthquake breaches the wall
the farfelled steeples resound
and we lie under the ground


oh soldiers saluted afar
by them that had seen your star
in conquest and freedom and pride
remember your friends that died


amid rejoicing and song
remember my lads how long
how deep the innocent trod
the grapes of the anger of god


i shall not die for you
another fellow may
good lads are left and true
though one departs away
but he departs today
and leaves his work to do
for i was luckless aye
and shall not die for you


the end of the year fell chilly
between a moon and a moon
through the twilight shrilly
the bells rang ringing no tune


the windows stained with story
the walls with miracle scored
were hidden for gloom and glory
filling the house of the lord


arch and aisle and rafter
and rooftree dizzily high
were full of weeping and laughter
and song and saying goodbye


there stood in the holy places
a multitude none could name
ranks of dreadful faces
flaming transfigured in flame


crown and tiar and mitre
were starry with gold and gem
christmas never was whiter
than fear on the face of them


in aisles that emperors vaulted
for a faith the world confessed
abasing the host exalted
they worshipped towards the west


they brought with laughter oblation
they prayed not bowing the head
they made without tear lamentation
and rendered me answer and said


o thou that seest our sorrow
it fares with us even thus
today we are gods tomorrow
hell have mercy on us


lo morning over our border
from out of the west comes cold
down ruins the ancient order
and empire builded of old


our house at even is queenly
with psalm and censers alight
look thou never so keenly
thou shalt not find us tonight


we are come to the end appointed
with sands not many to run
divinities disanointed
and kings whose kingdom is done


the peoples knelt down at our portal
all kindreds under the sky
we were gods and implored and immortal
once and today we die


they turned them again to their praying
they worshipped and took no rest
singing old tunes and saying
we have seen his star in the west


old tunes of the sacred psalters
set to wild farewells
and i left them there at their altars
ringing their own dead knells


home is the sailor home from sea
her farborne canvas furled
the ship pours shining on the quay
the plunder of the world


home is the hunter from the hill
fast in the boundless snare
all flesh lies taken at his will
and every fowl of air


tis evening on the moorland free
the starlit wave is still
home is the sailor from the sea
the hunter from the hill


the olive in its orchard
should now be rooted sure
to cast abroad its branches
and flourish and endure


aloft amid the trenches
its dressers dug and died
the olive in its orchard
should prosper and abide


close should the fruit be clustered
and light the leaf should wave
so deep the root is planted
in the corrupting grave


pray thee take care that takst my book in hand
to read it well that is to understand


it will be lookd for book when some but see

thou shouldshouldst be bold licentious full of gall

become a petulant thing hurl ink and wit
as madmen stones not caring whom they hit
deceive their malice who could wish it so
and by thy wiser temper let men know
thou art not covetous of least selffame
made from the hazard of anothers shame
much less with leud prophane and beastly phrase
to catch the worlds loose laughter or vain gaze
he that departs with his own honesty
for vulgar praise doth it too dearly buy


thou that makst gain thy end and wisely well
callst a book good or bad as it doth sell
use mine so too i give thee leave but crave
for the lucks sake it thus much favour have
to lye upon thy stall till it be sought
not offerd as it made suit to be bought
nor have my titleleaf on posts or walls
or in cleftsticks advanced to make calls
for termers or some clerklike servingman
who scarce can spell th hard names whose knight less can
if without these vile arts it will not sell
send it to bucklersbury there twill well


how best of kings dost thou a scepter bear
how best of poets dost thou laurel wear
but two things rare the fates had in their store
and gave thee both to shew they could no more
for such a poet while thy days were green
thou wert as chief of them are said thave been
and such a prince thou art we daily see
as chief of those still promise they will be
whom should my muse then fly to but the best
of kings for grace of poets for my test


when was there contract better driven by fate

may none whose scatterd names honour my book
for strict degrees of rank or title look

thou callst me poet as a term of shame
but i have my revenge made in thy name


at court i met it in clothes brave enough
to be a courtier and looks grave enough
to seem a statesman as i near it came
it made me a great face i askd the name
a lord it cried buried in flesh and blood
and such from whom let no man hope least good
for i will do none and as little ill
for i will dare none good lord walk dead still


shift here in town not meanest amongst squires
that haunt pickthatch mershlambeth and whitefryers

the charge of that state with this charm god pays
by that one spell he lives eats drinks arrays

the quarter day is come the hostess says
she must have money he returns god pays
the taylor brings a suit home he it ssays
looks oer the bill likes it and says god pays
he steals to ordinarys there he plays
at dice his borrowed money which god pays


then takes up fresh commodities for days
signs to new bonds forfeits and crys god pays
that lost he keeps his chamber reads essays
takes physick tears the papers still god pays
or else by water goes and so to plays
calls for his stool adorns the stage god pays
to every cause he meets this voice he brayes
his only answer is to all god pays
not his poor cocatrice but he betrays
thus and for his letchery scores god pays
but see th old baud hath servd him in his trim
lent him a pocky whore she hath paid him

all that i am in arts all that i know
how nothings that to whom my countrey owes
the great renown and name wherewith she goes

what name what skill what faith hast thou in things
what sight in searching the most antique springs
what weight and what authority in thy speech
man scarce can make that doubt but thou canst teach
pardon free truth and let thy modesty
which conquers all be once overcome by thee
many of thine this better could than i
but for their powers accept my piety

thy self into fresh brawls when calld upon
scarce thy weeks swearing brings thee off of one
so in short time th art in arrearage grown
some hundred quarrels yet dost thou fight none
nor needst thou for those few by oath releast
make good what thou darst do in all the rest
keep thy self there and think thy value right
he that dares damn himself dares more than fight

as guilty men do magistrates glad i

if thou ldst but use thy faith as thou didst then
when thou wert wont t admire not censure men
prythee believe still and not judge so fast
thy faith is all the knowledge that thou hast

here lies to each her parents ruth
mary the daughter of their youth

this grave partakes the fleshly birth

while beast instructs his fair and innocent wife
in the past pleasures of his sensual life
telling the motions of each petticoat

what doth he else but say leave to be chast
just wife and to change me make womans hast

don surly to aspire the glorious name
of a great man and to be thought the same
makes serious use of all great trade he knows
he speaks to men with a rhinocerotes nose
which he thinks great and so reads verses too
and that is done as he saw great men do
h has tympanies of business in his face
and can forget mens names with a great grace
he will both argue and discourse in oaths
both which are great and laugh at ill made cloaths
thats greater yet to cry his own up neat
he doth at meals alone his pheasant eat
which is main greatness and at his still board
he drinks to no man thats too like a lord
he keeps anothers wife which is a spice
of solemn greatness and he dares at dice
blaspheme god greatly or some poor hind beat
that breathes in his dogs way and this is great
nay more for greatness sake he will be one
may hear my epigrams but like of none
surly use other arts these only can
stile thee a most great fool but no great man

who says that giles and jone at discord be
th observing neighbours no such mood can see
indeed poor giles repents he married ever
but that his jone doth too and giles would never

and having got him out of doors is glad
the like is jone but turning home is sad
and so is jone ofttimes when giles doth find
harsh fights at home giles wisheth he were blind

of flattery to thy titles nor of wit
but i am glad to see that time survive
where merit is not sepulcherd alive
where good mens virtues them to honours bring
and not to dangers when so wise a king
contends thave worth enjoy from his regard
as her own conscience still the same reward
these noblest cecil labourd in my thought
wherein what wonder see thy name hath brought
that whilst i meant but thine to gratulate
ihave sung the greater fortunes of our state


away and leave me thou thing most abhord
that hast betrayd me to a worthless lord
made me commit most fircefierce idolatry
to a great image through thy luxury
be thy next masters more unlucky muse
and as thouhast mine his hours and youth abuse
get him the times long grudg the courts ill will
and reconcild keep him suspected still
make him lose all his friends and which is worse
almost all ways to any better course
with me thou leavst an happier muse than thee
and which thou broughtst me welcome poverty
she shall instruct my afterthoughts to write
things manly and not smelling parasite
but i repent me stay who ere is raisd
for worth he has not he is taxd not praisd


that neither fame nor love might wanting be
to greatness cary i sing that and thee
whose house if it no other honour had
in only thee might be both great and glad
who to upbraid the sloth of this our time
durst valour make almost but not a crime
which deed i know not whether were more high
or thou more happy it to justify
against thy fortune when no foe that day
could conquer thee but chance who did betray
love thy great loss which a renown hath won
to live when broeck not stands nor roor doth run
love honours which of best example be
when they cost dearest and are done most free
though every fortitude deserves applause
it may be much or little in the cause
hes valiantst that dares fight and not for pay
that vertuous is when the rewards away


since men have left to do praiseworthy things
most think all praises flatteries but truth brings
that sound and that authority with her name
as to be raisd by her is only fame
stand high then howard high in eyes of men
high in thy blood thy place but highest then
when in mens wishes so thy virtues wrought
as all thy honours were by them first sought
and thou designd to be the same thou art
before thou wert it in each good mans heart
which by no less confirmd than thy kings choice
proves that is gods which was the peoples voice


playwright convict of publick wrongs to men

two kinds of valour he doth shew at once

when nature bids us leave to live tis late
then to begin my roe he makes a state
in life that can employ it and takes hold
on the true causes ere they grow too old
delay is bad doubt worse depending worst
each best day of our life escapes us first
then since we more than many these truths know
though life be short let us not make it so

what ist fine grand makes thee my friendship fly
or take an epigram so fearfully
ast were a challenge or a borrowers letter
the world must know your greatness is my debter
inprimis grand you owe me for a jest
i lent you on meer acquaintance at a feast
item a tale or two some fortnight after
that yet maintains you and your house in laughter
item the babylonian song you sing
item a fair greek posy for a ring
with which a learned madam you bely
item a charm surrounding fearfully


your partieperpale picture one half drawn
in solemn cyphers the other cobweb lawn
item a gulling imprese for you at tilt
itemcomma omitted your mistress anagram iyour hilt
item your own sewd in your mistress smock
item an epitaph on my lords cock

than had i made em good to fit your vain
forty things more dear grand which you know true
for which or pay me quickly or ill pay you


whilst thy weighd judgments egerton i hear
and know thee then a judge not of one year
whilst i behold thee live with purest hands
that no affection in thy voice commands
that still thart present to the better cause
and no less wise than skilful in the laws
whilst thou art certain to thy words once gone
as is thy conscience which is always one
the virgin long since fled from earth i see
tour times returnd hath made her heaven in thee

this morning timely rapt with holy fire
i thought to form unto my zealous muse
what kind of creature i could most desire
to honour serve and love as poets use
i meant to make her fair and free and wise
of greatest blood and yet more good than great
i meant the daystar should not brighter rise
nor lend like influence from his lucent seat
i meant she should be courteous facile sweet
hating that solemn vice of greatness pride
i meant each softest vertue there should meet
fit in that softer bosom to reside
only a learned and a manly soul
i purposd her that should with even powers
the rock the spindle and the sheers controul
of destiny and spin her own free hours
such when i meant to fain and wishd to see
my muse bad bedford write and that was she


be safe nor fear thy self so good a fame
that any way my book should speak thy name
for if thou shame rankd with my friends to go
im more ashamd to have thee thought my foe


hornet thou hast thy wife drest for the stall

that poets are far rarer births than kings
your noblest father provd like whom before
or then or since about our muses springs
came not that soul exhausted so their store


hence was it that the destinies decreed
save that most masculine issue of his brain
no male unto him who could so exceed
nature they thought in all that he would fain
at which she happily displeasd made you
on whom if he were living now to look
he should those rare and absolute numbers view
as he would burn or better far his book


the ports of death are sins of life good deeds
through which our merit leads us to our meeds
how wilful blind is he then that should stray
and hath it in his powers to make his way
this world deaths region is the other lifes
and here it should be one of our first strifes
so to front death as men might judge us past it
for good men but see death the wicked tast it


forbear to tempt me proule i will not show
a line unto thee till the world it know
or that ihave by two good sufficient men

which if thou leave not soon though i am loth
i must a libel make and cozen both

madam i told you late how i repented
i askd a lord a buck and he denied me
and eer i could ask you i was prevented
for your most noble offer had supplid me
streight went i home and there most like a poet
i fancied to my self what wine what wit
i would have spent how every muse should know it
and phbusself should be at eating it
o madam if your grant did thus transfer me
make it your gift see whither that will bear me


goodyere im glad and grateful to report
my self a witness of thy few days sport
where i both learnd why wisemen hawking follow
and why that bird was sacred to apollo
she doth instruct men by her gallant flight
that they to knowledge so should tour upright
and never stoop but to strike ignorance
which if they miss yet they should readvance
to former height and there in circle tarry
till they be sure to make the fool their quarry
now in whose pleasures i have this discerned
what would his serious actions me have learned


when i would know thee goodyere my thought looks
upon thy wellmade choice of friends and books
then do i love thee and behold thy ends
in making thy friends books and thy books friends
now i must give thy life and deed the voice
attending such a study such a choice
where thought be love that to thy praise doth move
it was a knowledge that begat that love

would you believe when you this mounsieur see
that his whole body should speak french not he
that so much scarf of france and hat and feather
and shoe and tye and garter should come hether
and land on one whose face durst never be
toward the sea farther than halfway tree
that he untravelld should be french so much
as frenchmen in his company should seem dutch
or had his father when he did him get
the french disease with which he labours yet
or hung some mounsieurs picture on the wall
by which his dam conceivd him clothes and all
or is it some french statue no t doth move
and stoop and cringe o then it needs must prove
the new frenchtaylors motion monthly made
daily to turn in pauls and help the trade


if rome so great and in her wisest age
feard not to boast the glories of her stage
as skilful roscius and grave nfsop men
yet crownd with honors as with riches then
who had no less a trumpet of their name
than cicero whose every breath was fame
how can so great example dye in me
that allen i should pause to publish thee
who both their graces in thy self hast more
outstript than they did all that went before
and present worth in all dost so contract
as others speak but only thou dost act
wear this renown tis just that who did give
so many poets life by one should live


when mill first came to court the unprofiting fool
unworthy such a mistress such a school
was dull and long ere she would go to man
at last ease appetite and example wan
the nicer thing to taste her ladies page
and finding good security in his age
went on and proving him still day by day
discernd no difference of his years or play
not though that hair grew brown which once was amber
and he grown youth was calld to his ladies chamber


still mill continud nay his face growing worse
and he removd to gentman of the horse
mill was the same since both his body and face
blown up and he too unwieldy for that place
hath got the stewards chair he will not tarry
longer a day but with his mill will marry
and it is hopd that she like milo will
first bearing him a calf bear him a bull


which of thy names i take not only bears
a roman sound but roman vertue wears
illustrious vere or horace fit to be
sung by a horace or a muse as free
which thou art to thy self whose fame was won
in theye of europe where thy deeds were done
when on thy trumpet she did sound a blast
whose rellish to eternity shall last
i leave thy acts which should i prosecute
throughout might flattry seem and to be mute
to any one were envy which would live
against my grave and time could not forgive
i speak thy other graces not less shown
nor less in practice but less markd less known
humanity and piety which are
as noble in great chiefs as they are rare
and best become the valiant man to wear
who more should seek mens reverence than fear


ere cherries ripe and strawberries be gon
unto the crys of london ill add one
ripe statesmen ripe they grow in every street
at six and twenty ripe you shall em meet
and have em yield no favour but of state
ripe are their ruffs their cuffs their beards their gate
and grave as ripe like mellow as their faces
they know the states of christendom not the places
yet have they seen the maps and bought em too
and understand em as most chapmen do
the counsels projects practices they know
and what each prince doth for intelligence owe
and unto whom they are the almanacks
for twelve years yet to come what each state lacks
they carry in their pockets tacitus
and the gazetti or gallobelgicus
and talk reservd lockd up and full of fear
nay ask you how the day goes in your ear
keep a starchamber sentence close twelve days
and whisper what a proclamation says
they meet in sixes and at every mart
are sure to con the catalogue by heart
or every day some one at rimees looks
or bills and there he buys the names of books
they all get porta for the sundry ways
to write in cypher and the several keys
to ope the character theyve found the slight
with juice of limons onions piss to write
to break up seals and close em and they know
if the states make peace how it will go
with england all forbidden books they get
and of the powderplot they will talk yet
at naming the french king their heads they shake
and at the pope and spain slight faces make
or gainst the bishops for the brethren rail
much like those brethren thinking to prevail
with ignorance on us as they have done
on them and therefore do not only shun
others more modest but contemn us too
that know not so much state wrong as they do


how like a column radcliffe left alone
for the great mark of virtue those being gone
who did alike with thee thy house upbear
standst thou to shew the times what you all were
in ireland two bravely in the battle fell and dyd
upbraiding rebels arms and barbarous pride
and two that would have faln as great as they
the belgick fever ravished away
thou that art all their valour all their spirit
and thine own goodness to increase thy merit
than whose i do not know a whiter soul
nor could i had i seen all natures roul
thou yet remainst unhurt in peace or war
though not unprovd which shews thy fortunes are
willing to expiate the fault in thee
wherewith against thy blood they offenders be


lucy you brightness of our sphere who are
life of the muses day their morning star
if works not thauthors their own grace should look
whose poems would not wish to be your book
but these desird by you the makers ends
crown with their own rare poems ask rare friends
yet satyrs since the most of mankind be
their unavoided subject fewest see
for none ere took that pleasure in sins sense
but when they heard it taxd took more offence
they then that living where the matter is bred
dare for these poems yet both ask and read
and like them too must needfully though few
be of the best and mongst those best are you
lucy you brightness of our sphere who are
the muses evening as their morningstar


if my religion safe i durst embrace
that stranger doctrine of pythagoras
i should believe the soul of tacitus
in thee most weighty savile livd to us
so hast thou rendred him in all his bounds
and all his numbers both of sense and sounds
but when i read that special piece restord
where nero falls and galba is adord
to thine own proper i ascribe then more
and gratulate the breach i grievd before
which fate it seems causd in the history
only to boast thy merit in supply
o wouldst thou add like hand to all the rest
or better work were thy glad country blest
to have her story woven in thy thread
minervas loom was never richer spread
for who can master those great parts like thee
that livst from hope from fear from faction free
that hast thy breast so clear of present crimes
thou needst not shrink at voice of aftertimes
whose knowledge claimeth at the helm to stand
but wisely thrusts not forth a forward hand
no more than salust in the roman state
as then his cause his glory emulate
although to write be lesser than to do
it is the next deed and a great one too
we need a man that knows the several graces
of history and how to apt their places
where brevity where splendor and where height
where sweetness is required and where weight


we need a man can speak of the intents
the counsels actions orders and events
of state and censure them we need his pen
can write the things the causes and the men
but most we need his faith and all have you
that dares not write things false nor hide things true


who shall doubt donne where i a poet be
when i dare send my epigrams to thee
that so alone canst judge so alone dost make
and in thy censures evenly dost take
as free simplicity to disavow
as thou hast best authority t allow
read all i send and if i find but one
markd by thy hand and with the better stone
my titles seald those that for claps do write
let puinees porters players praise delight
and till they burst their backs like asses load
a man should seek great glory and not broad


see you yond motion not the old fading
nor captain pod nor yet the elthamthing
but one more rare and in the case so new
his cloak with orient velvet quite lind through
his rosie tyes and garters so oreblown
by his each glorious parcel to be known
he wont was to encounter me aloud
where ere he met me now hes dumb or proud
know you the cause h has neither land nor lease
nor bawdy stock that travels for increase
nor office in the town nor place in court
nor bout the bears nor noise to make lords sport
he is no favorites favorite no dear trust
of any madams hath neadd squireshath need o squires and must
nor did the king of denmark him salute
when he was here nor hath he got a sute
since he was gon more than the one he wears
nor are the queens most honord maids by thears
about his form what then so swells each limb
only his cloths hath overleavend him


thou hast begun well roe which stand well too
and i know nothing more thou hast to do
he that is round within himself and streight
need seek no other strength no other height
fortune upon him breaks her self if ill
and what would hurt his virtue makes it still
that thou at once then nobly mayst defend
with thine own course the judgment of thy friend
be always to thy gatherd self the same
and study conscience more than thou wouldst fame
though both be good the latter yet is worst
and ever is ill got without the first


that thou hast kept thy love encreast thy will
betterd thy trust to letters that thy skill
hast taught thy self worthy thy pen to tread
and that to write things worthy to be read
how much of great example wert thou roe
if time to facts as unto men would owe
but much it now avails whats done of whom
the selfsame deeds as diversly they come


tfrom place or fortune are made high or low
and even the praisers judgment suffers so
well though thy name less than our great ones be
thy fact is more let truth encourage thee

to night grave sir both my poor house and i
do equally desire your company
not that we think us worthy such a guest
but that your worth will dignifie our feast
with those that come whose grace may make that seem
something which else could hope for no esteem
it is the fair acceptance sir creates
the entertainment perfect not the cates
yet shall you have to rectifie your palate
an olive capers or some better sallad
ushring the mutton with a shortlegd hen
if we can get her full of eggs and then
limons and wine for sauce to these a coney
is not to be despaird of for our money
and though fowl now be scarce yet there are clarks
the sky not falling think we may have larks
ill tell you of more and lye so you will come
of partridg pheasant woodcock of which some
may yet be there and godwit if we can
knat rail and ruff too how so ere my man
shall read a piece of virgil tacitus
livy or of some better book to us
of which well speak our minds amidst our meat
and ill profess no verses to repeat
to this if ought appear which i know not of
that will the pastry not my paper show of
digestive cheese and fruit there sure will be
but that which most doth take my muse and me
is a pure cup of rich canary wine
which is the mermaids now but shall be mine
of which had horace or anacreon tasted
their lives as do their lines till now had lasted
tabacco nectar or the thespian spring
are all but luthers beer to this i sing
of this we will sup free but moderately
and we will have no pooly or parrot by
nor shall our cups make any guilty men
but at our parting we will be as when
we innocently met no simple word
that shall be utterd at our mirthful board
shall make us sad next morning or affright
the liberty that well enjoy to night


ido but name thee pembroke and i find
it is an epigram on all mankind
against the bad but of and to the good
both which are askd to have thee understood
nor could the age have mist thee in this strife
of vice and virtue wherein all great life
almost is exercisd and scarce one knows
to which yet of the sides himself he owes
they follow virtue for reward to day
to morrow vice if she give better pay
and are so good or bad just at a price
as nothing else discerns the virtue or vice


but thou whose nobless keeps one stature still
and one true posture though besiegd with ill
of what ambition faction pride can raise
whose life evn they that envy it must praise
that are so reverencd as thy coming in
but in the view doth interrupt their sin
thou must draw more and they that hope to see
the commonwealth still safe must study thee


how well fair crown of your fair sex might he
that but the twilight of your sprite did see
and noted for what flesh such souls were framd
know you to be a sydney though unnamd
and being namd how little doth that name
need any muses praise to give it fame
which is it self the imprese of the great
and glory of them all but to repeat
forgive me then if mine but say you are
a sydney but in that extend as far
as lowdest praisers who perhaps would find
for every part a character assignd
my praise is plain and where so ere profest
becomes none more than you who need it least


were they that namd you prophets did they see
even in the dew of grace what you would be
or did our times require it to behold
a new susanna equal to that old
or because some scarce think that story true
to make those faithful did the fates send you
and to your scene lent no less dignity
of birth of match of form of chastity
or more than born for the comparison
of former age or glory of our own
were you advanced past those times to be
the light and mark unto posterity
judge they that can here i have raisd to show
a picture vvhich the world for yours must know
and like it too if they look equally
if not tis fit for you some should envy


madam had all antiquity been lost
all history seald up and fables crost
that we had left us nor by time nor place
least mention of a nymph a muse a grace
but even their names were to be made anew
who could not but create them all from you
he that but saw you wear the vvheaten hat
would call you more than ceres if not that
and drest in shepherds tyre who would not say
you were the bright oenone flora or may
if dancing all would cry th idalian queen
were leading forth the graces on the green
and armed to the chase so bare her bow
dianaalone so hit and hunted so
theres none so dull that for your style would ask
that saw you put on pallas plumed cask
or keeping your due state that would not cry
there juno sat and yet no peacock by
so are you natures index and restore
iyour self all treasure lost of thage before


if men get name for some one vertue then
what man art thou that art so many men
allvirtuous herbert on whose every part
truth might spend all her voice fame all her art
whether thy learning they would take or wit
or valour or thy judgment seasoning it
thy standing upright to thy self thy ends
like straight thy piety to god and friends
their latter praise would still the greatest be
and yet they all together less than thee


do what you come for captain with your news
thats sit and eat do not my ears abuse
i oft look on false coin to knowt from true
not that i love it more than i will you
tell the gross dutch those grosser tales of yours
how great you were with their two emperours
and yet are with their princes fill them full
of your moravian horse venetian bull
tell them what parts youve tane whence run away
what states youve gulld and which yet keeps yoin pay
give them your services and embassies
in ireland holland sweden pompous lies
in hungary and poland turky too
what at ligorn rome florence you did do
and in some year all these together heapd
for which there must more sea and land be leapd
if but to be believd you have the hap
then can a flea at twice skip ith map
give your young statesmen that first make you drunk
and then lye with you closer than a punk
for news your villeroyes and silleries
ianins your nuncios and your tuilleries
your archdukes agents and your beringhams
that are your words of credit keep your names
of hannow shieterhuissen popenheim
hansspiegle rotteinberg and boutersheim
for your next meal this you are sure of why
will you part with them here unthriftily
nay now you puff tusk and draw up your chin
twirl the poor chain you run a feasting in
come be not angry you are hungry eat
do what you come for captain theres your meat


strength of my country whilst i bring to view
such as are misscalld captains and wrong you
and your high names i do desire that thence
be nor put on you nor you take offence
i swear by your true friend my muse i love
your great profession which i once did prove
and did not shame it with my actions then
no more than i dare now do with my pen
he that not trusts me having vowd thus much
buts angry for the captain still is such


who now calls on thee nevil is a muse
that serves nor fame nor titles but doth choose
where virtue makes them both and thats in thee
where all is fair beside thy pedigree
thou art not one seekst miseries with hope
wrestlest with dignities or fainst a scope


of service to the publick when the end
is private gain which hath long guilt to friend
thou rather strivst the matter to possess
and elements of honour than the dress
to make thy lent life good against the fates
and first to know thine own state then the states
to be the same in root thou art in height
and that thy soul should give thy flesh her weight
go on and doubt not what posterity
now i have sung the thus shall judg of thee
thy deeds unto thy name will prove new wombs
whilst others toil for titles to their tombs


not cnfsars deeds nor all his honours won
in these westparts nor when that war was done
the name of pompey for an enemy
catos to boot rome and her liberty
all yielding to his fortune nor the while
to have engravd these acts with his own stile
and that so strong and deep ast might be thought
he wrote with the same spirit that he fought
nor that his work livd in the hands of foes
unargued then and yet hath fame from those
not all these edmonds or what else put too
can so speak cnfsar as thy labours do
for where his person livd scarce one just age
and that midst envy and parts then fell by rage
his deeds too dying but in books whose good
how few have read how fewer understood
thy learned hand and true promethean art
as by a new creation part by part
in every counsel stratagem design
action or engine worth a note of thine
tall future time not only doth restore
his life but makes that he can dye no more


who edmonds reads thy book and doth not see
what thantick soldiers were the modern be
wherein thou shewst how much the latter are
beholding to this master of the war
and that in action there is nothing new
more than to vary what our elders knew
which all but ignorant captains will confess
nor to give cnfsar this makes ours the less
yet thou perhaps shalt meet some tongues will grutch
that to the world thou shouldst reveal so much
and thence deprave thee and thy work to those
cnfsar stands up as from his urn late rose
by thy great help and doth proclaim by me
they murther him again that envy thee


with thy small stock why art thou ventring still
at this so subtle sport and playst so ill
thinkst thou it is meer fortune that can win
or thy rank setting that thou darst put in
thy all at all and what so ere i do
art still at that and thinkst to blow me up too
i cannot for the stage a drama lay
tragick or comick but thou writst the play
i leave thee there and giving way intend
an epick poem thou hast the same end
i modestly quit that and think to write
next morn an ode thou makst a song ere night


i pass to elegies thou meetst me there
to satyrs and thou dost pursue me where
where shall i scape thee in an epigram
o thou cryst out that is thy proper game
troth if it be i pity thy ill luck
that both for wit and sense so oft dost pluck
and never are encounterd i confess
nor scarce dost colour for it which is less
pry thee yet save thy rest give ore in time
theres no vexation that can make thee prime


so phbus make me worthy of his bays
as but to speak thee overbury is praise
so where thou livst thou makst life understood
where what makes others great doth keep thee good
i think the fate of court thy coming cravd
that the wit there and manners might be savd
for since what ignorance what pride is fled
and letters and humanity in the stead
repent thee not of thy fair precedent
could make such men and such a place repent
nor may any fear to lose of their degree
whoin such ambition can but follow thee


imust believe some miracles still be
when sydneys name i hear or face i see
for cupid who at first took vain delight
in meer outforms until he lost his sight
hath changd his soul and made his object you
where finding so much beauty met with virtue
he hath not only gaind himself his eyes
but in your love made all his servants wise


you wonder who this is and why i name
him not aloud that boasts so good a fame
naming so many too but this is one
suffers no name but a description
being no vitious person but the vice
about the town and known too at that price
a subtle thing that doth affections win
by speaking well oth company its in
talks loud and bawdy has a gatherd deal
of news and noise to sow out a long meal
can come from tripoly leap stools and wink
do all that longs to the anarchy of drink
except the duel can sing songs and catches
give every one his dose of mirth and watches
whose names unwelcome to the present ear
and him it lays on if he be not there
tells of him all the tales it self then makes
but if it shall be questiond undertakes
it will deny all and forswear it too
not that it fears but will have to do
with such a one and therein keeps its word
twill see its sister naked ere a sword
at every meal where it doth dine or sup
the cloths no sooner gon but it gets up
and shifting of its faces doth play more
parts than thitalian could do with his dore
acts old iniquity and in the fit
of miming gets thopinion of a wit
executes men in picture by defect
from friendship is its own fames architect
an ingineer in slanders of all fashions
that seeming praises are yet accusations


describd its thus defind would you it have
then the towns honest mans her errantst knave


jephson thou man of men to whose lovd name
all gentry yet owe part of their best flame
so did thy virtue inform thy wit sustain
that age when thou stoodst up the masterbrain
thou wert the first madst merit know her strength
and those that lackd it to suspect at length
twas not entayld on title that some word
might be found out as good and not my lord
that nature no such difference had imprest
in men but every bravest was the best
that bloud not minds but minds did bloud adorn
and to live great was better than great born
these were thy knowing arts which who doth now
vertuously practise must at least allow
them in if not from thee or must commit
a desperate solcism in truth and wit


groyne come of age his state sold out of hand
for his whore groyne doth still occupy his land


gut eats all day and lechers all the night
so all his meat he tasteth over twice
and striving so to double his delight
he makes himself a thoroughfare of vice
thus in his belly can he change a sin
lust it comes out that gluttony went in


not he that flies the court for want of cloths
at hunting rails having no gift in oaths
cries out gainst cocking since he cannot bet
shuns press for two main causes pox and debt
with me can merit more than that good man
whose dice not doing well to a pulpit ran
no shelton give me thee canst want all these
but dost it out of judgment not disease
darst breath in any air and with safe skill
till thou canst find the best choose the least ill
that to the vulgar canst thy self apply
treading a better path not contrary
and in their errors maze thine own way know
which is to live to conscience not to show
he that but living half his age dyes such
makes the whole longer than twas given him much


weep with me all you that read
this little story
and know from whom a tear you shed
deaths self is sorry
twas a child that so did thrive
in grace and feature
as heaven and nature seemd to strive
which ownd the creature
years he numbred scarce thirteen
when fates turnd cruel
yet three filld zodiacks had he been
the stages jewel


and did act what now we moan
old men so duly
as sooth the parcnf thought him one
he playd so truly
so by error to his fate
they all consented
but viewing him since alas too late
they have repented
and have sought to give new birth
in baths to steep him
but being so much too good for earth
heaven vows to keep him


rudyerd as lesser dames to great ones use
my lighter comes to kiss thy learned muse
whose better studies while she emulates
she learns to know long difference of their states
yet is the office not to be despisd
if only love should make the action prizd
nor he for friendship to be thought unfit
that strives his manners should proceed his wit


if i would wish for truth and not for show
the aged saturns age and rites to know
if i would strive to bring back times and try
the worlds pure gold and wise simplicity
if i would virtue set as she was young
and hear her speak with one and her first tongue
if holiest friendship naked to the touch
i would restore and keep it ever such
i need no other arts but study thee
who provst all these were and again may be


writing thy self or judging others writ
i know not which thhast most candor or wit
but both thhast so as who affects the state
of the best writer and judge should emulate


wouldst thou hear what man can say
in a little reader stay
underneath this stone doth lie
as much beauty as could die
which in life did harbor give
to more virtue than doth live
if at all she had a fault
leave it buried in this vault
one name was elizabeth
thother let it sleep with death
fitter where it dyed to tell
than that it livd at all farewell


uvdale thou piece of the first times a man
made for what nature could or virtue can
both whose dimensions lost the world might find
restored in thy body and thy mind
who sees a soul in such a body set
might love the treasure for the cabinet
but i no child no fool respect the kind
the full the slowingflowing graces there enshrind


which would the world not miscallt flattery
i could adore almost tidolatry


retird with purpose your fair worth to praise
mongst hampton shades and phbus grove of bayes
i pluckd a branch the jealous god did frown
and bad me lay thusurped lawrel down
said i wrongd him and which was more his love
i answerd daphne now no pain can prove
phbus replied bold head it is not she
cary my love is daphne but my tree


is there a hope that man would thankful be
if i should fail in gratitude to thee
to whom i am so bound lovd aubigny
no i do therefore call posterity
into the debt and reckon on her head
how full of want how swallowd up how dead
i and this muse had been if thou hadst not
lent timely succors and new life begot
so all reward or name that grows to me
by her attempt shall still be owing thee
and than this same i know no abler way
to thank thy benefits which is to pay


roe and my joy to name thart now to go
countries and climes manners and men to know
t extract and choose the best of all these known
and those to turn to blood and make thine own
may winds as soft as breath of kissing friends
attend thee hence and there may all thy ends
as the beginnings here prove purely sweet
and perfect in a circle always meet
so when we blest with thy return shall see
thy self with thy first thoughts brought home by thee
we each to other may this voice inspire
this is that good nfneas past through fire
through seas storms tempests and imbarqud for hell
came back untouchd this man hath travelld well


what charming peals are these
that while they bind the senses do so please
they are the marriagerites
of two the choicest pair of mans delights
musique and ponksie
french air and english verse here wedded lie
who did this knot compose
again hath brought the lilly to the rose
and with their chained dance
recelebrates the joyful match with france
they are a school to win
the fair french daughter to learn english in
and graced with her song
to make the language sweet upon her tongue


that not a pair of friends each other see
but the first question is when one saw thee
that theres no journy set or thought upon
to braynford hackney bow but thou makst one


tthat scarce the town designeth any feast
to which thourt not a week bespoke a guest
that still thourt made the suppers flag the drum
the very call to make all others come
thinkst thou mime this is great or that they strive
whose noise shall keep thy miming most alive
whilst thou dost raise some player from the grave
outdance the babion or outboast the brave
or mounted on a stool thy face doth hit
on some new gesture thats imputed wit
o run not proud of this yet take thy due
thou dost outzany cokely pod nay gue
and thine own coriat too but wouldst thou see
men love thee not for this they laugh at thee


to urge my lovd alphonso that bold fame
of building towns and making wild beasts tame
which musick had or speak her known effects
that she removeth cares sadness ejects
declineth anger persuades clemency
doth sweeten mirth and heighten piety
and is ta body often ill inclind
no less a sovraign cure than to the mind
t alledge that greatest men were not ashamd
of old even by her practice to be famd
to say indeed she were the soul of heaven
that the eighteighth sphere no less than planets seven
movd by her order and the ninth more high
including all were thence calld harmony
i yet had utterd nothing on thy part
when these were but the praises of the art
but when i have said the proofs of all these be
shed in thy songs tis true but short of thee


when we do give alphonso to the light
a work of ours we part with our own right
for then all mouths will judge and their own way
the learnd have no more priviledge than the lay
and though we could all men all censures hear
we ought not give them taste we had an ear
for if the humrous world will take at large
they should be fools for me at their own charge
say this or that man they to thee prefer
even those for whom they do this know they err
and would being askd the truth ashamed say
they were not to be namd on the same day
then stand unto thy self nor seek without
for fame with breath soon kindled soon blown out


if to admire were to commend my praise
might then both thee thy work and merit raise
but as it is the child of ignorance
and utter stranger to all air of france
how can i speak of thy great pains but err
since they can only judge that can confer
behold the reverend shade of bartas stands
before my thought and in thy right commands
that to the world i publish for him this
bartas doth wish thy english now were his
so well in that are his inventions wrought
as his will now be the translation thought
thine the original and france shall boast
no more those maiden glories she hath lost


no more let greece her bolder fables tell
of hercules or theseus going to hell
orpheus ulysses or the latine muse
with tales of troys just knight our faiths abuse
we have a shelton and a heyden got
had power to act what they to fain had not
all that they boast of styx of acheron
cocytus phlegeton our have provd in one
the filth stench noise save only what was there
subtly distinguishd was confused here
their wherry had no sail too ours had none
and in it two more horrid knaves than charon
arses were heard to croak in stead of frogs
and for one cerberus the whole coast was dogs
furies there wanted not each scold was ten
and for the cryes of ghosts women and men
laden with plaguesores and their sins were heard
lashd by their consciences to die affeard
then let the former age with this content her
she brought the poets forth but ours th adventer


sing the brave adventure of two wights
and pity tis i cannot call em knights
one was and he for brawn and brain right able
to have been styled of king arthurs table
the other was a squire of fair degree
but in the action greater man than he
who gave to take at his return from hell
his three for one now lordlings listen well
it was the day what time the powerful moon
makes the poor bankside creature wet itshoonwet its shoon
in itown hallin its own hall when these in worthy scorn
of those that put out monies on return
from venice paris or some inland passage
of six times to and fro without embassage
or he that backward went to berwick or which
did dance the famous morris unto norwich
at breadstreets mermaid having dind and merry
proposd to go to holborn in a wherry
a harder task than either his to bristo
or his to antwerp therefore once more list ho
a dock there is that called is avernus
of some bridewel and may in time concern us
all that are readers but methinks tis odd
that all this while i have forgot some god
or goddess to invoke to stuff my verse
and with both bombardstile and phrase rehearse
the many perils of this port and how
sanshelp of sybil or a golden bough
or magick sacrifice they past along
alcides be thou succouring to my song
thoust seen hell some say and knowst all nooks there
canst tell me best how every fury looks there
and art a god if fame thee not abuses
always at hand to aid the merry muses
great clubfist tho thy back and bones be sore
still with thy former labours yet once more
act a brave work call it thy last adventry
but hold my torch while i describe the entry
to this dire passage say thou stop thy nose
tis but light pains indeed this docks no rose
in the first jaws appeard that ugly monster
ycleped mud which when their oars did once stir
belchd forth an air as hot as at the muster
of all your nighttubs when the carts do cluster
who shall discharge first his merdurinous load
thorow her womb they make their famous road


between two walls where on one side to scare men
were seen your ugly centaurs ye call carmen
gorgonian scolds and harpys on the other
hung stench diseases and old filth their mother
with famine wants and sorrows many a dosen
the least of which was to the plague a cosen
but they unfrighted pass tho many a privy
spake to them louder than the ox in livy
and many a sink pourd out her rage anenstem
but still their valor and their virtue fenct em
and on they went like castor brave and pollux
plowing the main when see the worst of all lucks
they met the second prodigy would fear a
man that had never heard of a chimnfra
one said it was bold briareus or the beadle
who hath the hundred hands when he doth meddle
the other thought it hydra or the rock
made of the trull that cut her fathers lock
but coming near they found it but a liter
so huge it seemd they could by no means quit her
back cryd their brace of charons they cryd no
no going back on still you rogues and row
how hight the place a voice was heard cocytus
row close then slaves alas they will beshite us
no matter stinkards row what croaking sound
is this we hear of frogs no guts windbound
over your heads well row at this a loud
crack did report itself as if a cloud
had burst with storm and down fell ab excelsis
poor mercury crying out on paracelsus
and all his followers that had so abusd him
and in so shitten sort so long had usd him
for where he was the god of eloquence
and subtilty of metals they dispense
his spirits now in pills and eke in potions
suppositories cataplasms and lotions
but many moons there shall not wane quoth he
in the mean time let em imprison me
but i will speak and know i shall be heard
touching this cause where they will be affeard
to answer me and sure it was th intent
of the grave fart late let in parliament
had it been seconded and not in fume
vanishd away as you must all presume
their mercury did now by this the steme
of the hulk touchd and as by polypheme
the sly ulysses stole in a sheepskin
the wellgreasd wherry now had got between
and bade her farewell sough unto the lurden
never did bottom more betray her burden
the meatboat of bearscolledge parisgarden
stunk not so ill nor when she kist kate arden
yet one day in the year for sweet tis voyct
and that is when it is the lord mayors foist
by this time had they reachd the stygian pool
by which the masters swear when on the stool
of worship they their nodding chins do hit
against their breasts here sevral ghosts did flit
about the shore of farts but late departed
white black blue green and in more forms outstarted
than all those atomi ridiculous
whereof old democrite and hill nicholas
one said the other swore the world consists
these be the cause of those thick frequent mists
arising in that place through which who goes
must try th unused valor of a nose


and that ours did for yet no nare was tainted
nor thumb nor finger to the stop acquainted
but open and unarmd encounterd all
whether it languishing stuck upon the wall
or were precipitated down the jakes
and after swum abroad in ample flakes
or that it lay heapd like an usurers mass
all was to them the same they were to pass
and so they did from styx to acheron
the everboiling flood whose banks upon
your fleetlane furies and hot cooks do dwell
that with stillscalding steems make the place hell
the sinks ran grease and hair of meazled hogs
the heads houghs entrails and the hydes of dogs
for to say truth what scullion is so nasty
to put the skins and offal in a pasty
cats there lay divers had been flead and rosted
and after mouldy grown again were tosted
then selling not a dish was tane to mince em
but still it seemd the rankness did convince em
for here they were thrown in with th melted pewter
yet drownd they not they had five lives in future


but mongst these tiberts who do you think there was
old banks the jugler our pythagoras
grave tutor to the learned horse both which
being beyond sea burned for one witch
their spirits transmigrated to a cat
and now above the pool a face right fat
with great grey eyes are lifted up and mewd
thrice did it spit thrice divd at last it viewd
our brave heroes with a milder glare
and in a pitious tune began how dare
your dainty nostrils in so hot a season
when every clerk eats artichokes and peason
laxative lettuce and such windy meat
tempt such a passage when each privies seat
is filld with buttock and the walls do sweat
urine and plasters when the noise doth beat
upon your ears of discords so unsweet
and outcries of the damned in the fleet
cannot the plaguebill keep you back nor bells
of loud sepulchres with their hourly knels
but you will visit grisly plutos hall
behold where cerberus reard on the wall
of holborne three sergeants heads looks ore
and stays but till you come unto the door
tempt not his fury pluto is away
and madame cnfsar great proserpina
is now from home you lose your labours quite
were you joves sons or had alcides might
they cryd out pusse he told them he was banks
that had so often shewd em merry pranks
they laught at his laughworthy fate and past
the tripplehead without a sop at last
calling for radamanthus that dwelt by
a sopeboyler and nfacus him nigh
who kept an alehouse with my little minos
an ancient purblind fletcher with a high nose
they took em all to witness of their action
and so went bravely back without protraction


in memory of which most liquid deed
the city since hath raisd a pyramid
and i could wish for their eternizd sakes
my muse had ploughd with his that sung ajax


some act of loves bound to rehearse
i thought to bind him in my verse
which when he felt away quoth he
can poets hope to fetter me
it is enough they once did get
mars and my mother in their net
i wear not these my wings in vain
with which he fled me and again
into my rhymes could nere be got
by any art then wonder not
that since my numbers are so cold
when love is fled and i grow old


thou art not penshurst built to envious show
of touch or marble nor canst boast a row
of polishd pillars or a roof of gold
thou hast no lanthern whereof tales are told
or stair or courts but standst an ancient pile
and these grudgd at are reverencd the while
thou joyst in better marks of soil of air
of wood of water therein thou art fair
thou hast thy walks for health as well as sport
thy mount to which the dryads do resort
where pan and bacchus their high feasts have made
beneath the broad beech and the chestnut shade
that taller tree which of a nut was set
at his great birth where all the muses met
there in the writhed bark are cut the names
of many a sylvane taken with his flames
and thence the ruddy satyrs oft provoke
the lighter fauns to reach thy ladys oke
thy copps too namd of gamage thou hast there
that never fails to serve thee seasond deer
when thou wouldst feast or exercise thy friends
the lower land that to the river bends
thy sheep thy bullocks kine and calves do feed
the middle grounds thy mares and horses breed
each bank doth yield thee conies and the topps
fertile of wood ashore and sydneys copps
to crown thy open table doth provide
the purpled pheasant with the speckled side
the painted partridg lyes in every field
and for thy mess is willing to be killd
and if the highswoln medway fail thy dish
thou hast thy ponds that pay thee tribute fish
fat aged carps that run into thy net
and pikes now weary their own kind to eat
as loth the second draught or cast to stay
officiously at first themselves betray


bright eels that emulate them and leap on land
before the fisher or into his hand
then hath thy orchard fruit thy garden flowers
fresh as the air and new as are the hours
the early cherry with the later plum
fig grape and quince each in his time doth come
the blushing apricot and woolly peach
hang on thy walls that every child may reach
and though thy walls be of the country stone
theyre reard with no mans ruin no mans grone
theres none that dwell about them wish them down
but all come in the farmer and the clown
and no one emptyhanded to salute
thy lord and lady though they have no sute
some bring a capon some a rural cake
some nuts some apples some that think they make
the better cheeses bring em or else send
by their ripe daughters whom they would commend
this way to husbands and whose baskets bear
an emblem of themselves in plum or pear
but what can this more than express their love
add to thy free provisions far above
the need of such whose liberal board doth flow
with all that hospitality doth know
where comes no guest but is allowd to eat
without his fear and of thy lords own meat
where the same bear and bread and selfsame wine
that is his lordships shall be also mine
and i not fain to sit as some this day
at great mens tables and yet dine away
here no man tells my cups nor standing by
a waiter doth my gluttony envy
but gives me what i call for and lets me eat
he knows below he shall find plenty of meat
thy tables hoard not up for the next day
nor when i take my lodging need i pray
for fire or lights or livory all is there
as if thou then wert mine or i raignd here
theres nothing i can wish for which i stay
that found king james when hunting late this way
with his brave son the prince they saw thy fires
shine bright on every hearth as the desires
of thy penates had been set on flame
to entertain them or the country came
with all their zeal to warm their welcom here
what great i will not say but sudden chear
didst thou then make em and what praise was heapd
on thy good lady then who therein reapd
the just reward of her high huswifery
to have her linnen plate and all things nigh
when she was far and not a room but drest
as if it had expected such a guest
these penshurst are thy praise and yet not all
thy ladys noble fruitful chast withall
his children thy great lord may call his own
a fortune in this age but rarely known


they are and have been taught religion thence
their gentler spirits have suckd innocence
each morn and even they are taught to pray
with the whole houshold and may every day
read in their virtuous parents noble parts
the mysteries of manners arms and arts
now penshurst they that will proportion thee
with other edifices when they see
those proud ambitious heaps and nothing else
may say their lords have built but thy lord dwells


how blest art thou canst love the country wroth
whether by choice or fate or both
and though so near the city and the court
art tane with neithers vice nor sport
that at great times art no ambitious guest
of sheriffs dinner or mayors feast
nor comst to view the better cloth of state
the richer hangings or crownplate
nor throngst when masquing is to have a sight
of the short bravery of the night
to view the jewels stuffs the pains the wit
there wasted some not paid for yet
but canst at home in thy securer rest
live with unbought provision blest
free from proud porches or their gilded roofs
mongst loughing heards and solid hoofs
alongst the curled woods and painted meads
through which a serpent river leads
to some cool courteous shade which he calls his
and makes sleep softer than it is
or if thou list the night in watch to break
abed canst hear the loud stag speak
in spring oft roused for their masters sport
who for it makes thy house his court
or with thy friends the heart of all the year
dividst upon the lesser deer
in autumn at the partridg makst a flight
and givst thy gladder guests the sight
and in the winter huntst the flying hare
more for thy exercise than fare
while all that follow their glad ears apply
to the full greatness of the cry
or hauking at the river or the bush
otor shooting at the greedy thrush
thou dost with some delight the day outwear
although the coldest of the year
the whilst the several seasons thou hast seen
of flowry fields of copces green
the mowed meadows with the fleeced sheep
and feasts that either shearers keep
the ripened ears yet humble in their height
and furrows laden with their weight
the appleharvest that doth longer last
the hogs returnd home fat from mast
the trees cut out in log and those boughs made
a fire now that lend a shade
thus pan and sylvane having had their rites
comus puts in for new delights
and fills thy open hall with mirth and cheer
as if in saturns reign it were
apollos harp and hermes lyre resound
nor are the muses strangers found
the rout of rural folk come thronging in
their rudeness then is thought no sin
thy noblest spouse affords them welcome grace
and the great heroes of her race
sit mixt with loss of state or reverence
freedom doth with degree dispense
the jolly wassal walks the often round
and in their cups their cares are drownd


they think not then which side the cause shall leese
nor how to get the lawyer fees
such and no other was that age of old
which boasts thave had the head of gold
and such since thou canst make thine own content
strive wroth to live long innocent
let others watch in guilty arms and stand
the fury of a rash command
go enter breaches meet the cannons rage
that they may sleep with scars in age
and shew their feathers shot and colours torn
and brag that they were therefore born
let this man sweat and wrangle at the bar
for every price in every jar
and change possessions oftner with his breath
than either money war or death
let him than hardest sires more disinherit
and each where boast it as his merit
to blow up orphans widows and their states
and think his power doth equal fates
let that go heap a mass of wretched wealth
purchasd by rapine worse than stealth
and brooding ore it sit with broadest eyes
not doing good scarce when he dyes
let thousands more go flatter vice and win
by being organs to great sin
get place and honor and be glad to keep
the secrets that shall break their sleep
and so they ride in purple eat in plate
though poyson think it a great fate
but thou my wroth if i can truth apply
shalt neither that nor this envy
thy peace is made and when mans state is well
tis better if he there can dwell
god wisheth none should wrack on a strange shelf
to him mans dearer than thimself
and howsoever we may think things sweet
he always gives what he knows meet
which who can use is happy such be thou
thy mornings and thy evenings vow
be thanks to him and earnest prayer to find
a body sound with sounder mind
to do thy country service thy self right
that neither want do thee affright
nor death but when thy latest sand is spent
thou mayst think life a thing but lent


false world goodnight since thou hast brought
that hour upon my morn of age
henceforth i quit thee from my thought
my part is ended on thy stage
do not once hope that thou canst tempt
a spirit so resolvd to tread
upon thy throat and live exempt
from all the nets that thou canst spread
i know thy forms are studied arts
thy subtil ways be narrow straits
thy curtesy but sudden starts
and what thou callst thy gifts are baits
i know too though thou strut and paint
yet art thou both shrunk up and old
that only fools make thee a saint
and all thy good is to be sold
i know thou whole art but a shop
of toys and trifles traps and snares
to take the weak or make them stop
yet art thou falser than thy wares
and knowing this should i yet stay
like such as blow away their lives
and never will redeem a day
enamord of their golden gyves


or having scapd shall i return
and thrust my neck into the noose
from whence so lately i did burn
with all my powers my self to loose
what bird or beast is known so dull
that fled his cage or broke his chain
and tasting air and freedom twull
render his head in theirthere again
if these who have but sense can shun
the engins that have them annoyd
little for me had reason done
if i could not thy ginns avoid
yes threaten do alas i fear
as little as i hope from thee
i know thou canst nor shew nor bear
more hatred than thou hast to me
my tender first and simple years
thou didst abuse and then betray
since stirdst up jealousies and fears
when all the causes were away
then in a soil hast planted me
where breathe the basest of thy fools
where envious arts professed be
and pride and ignorance the schools
where nothing is examind weighd
but as tis rumord so believd
where every freedom is betrayd
and every goodness taxd or grievd
but what were born for we must bear
our frail condition it is such
that what to all may happen here
ift chance to me i must not grutch
else i my state should much mistake
to harbour a divided thought
from all my kind that for my sake
there should a miracle be wrought
no i do know that i was born
to age misfortune sickness grief
but i will bear these with that scorn
as shall not need thy false relief
nor for my peace will i go far
as wandrers do that still do rome
but make my strengths such as they are
here in my bosom and at home


come my celia let us prove
while we may the sports of love
time will not be ours for ever
he at length our good will sever
spend not then his gifts in vain
suns that set may rise again
but if once we lose this light
tis with us perpetual night
why should we defer our joys
fame and rumor are but toys
cannot we delude the eyes
of a few poor houshold spies
or his easier ears beguil
so removed by our wile
tis no sin loves fruit to steal
but the sweet theft to reveal
to be taken to be seen
these have crimes accounted been


kiss me sweet the wary lover
can your favours keep and cover
when the common courting jay
all your bounties will betray
kiss again no creature comes
kiss and score up wealthy sums
on my lips thus hardly sundred
while you breathe first give a hundred
then a thousand then another
hundred then unto the tother
add a thousand and so more
till you equal with the store
all the grass that rumney yields
or the sands in chelsey fields
or the drops in silver thames
or the stars that gild his streams
in the silent summernights
when youths ply their stoln delights
that the curious may not know
how to tell em as they flow
and the envious when they find
what their number is be pind


follow a shadow it still flies you
seem to fly it it will pursue
so court a mistress she denies you
let her alone she will court you
say are not women truly then
stild but the shadows of us men
at morn and even shades are longest
at noon they are short or none
so men at weakest they are strongest
but grant us perfect theyre not known
say are not women truly then
stild but the shadows of us men


why disease dost thou molest
ladies and of them the best
do not men ynow of rites
to thy altars by their nights
spent in surfeits and their days
and nights too in worser ways
take heed sickness what you do
i shall fear youll surfeit too
live not we as all thy stalls
spittles pesthouse hospitals
scarce will take our present store
and this age will build no more
pray thee feed contented then
sickness only on us men
or if it needs thy lust will taste
womankind devour the waste
livers round about the town
but forgive me with thy crown
they maintain the truest trade
and have more diseases made
what should yet thy pallat please
daintiness and softer ease
sleeked lims and finest blood
if thy leanness love such food


there are those that for thy sake
do enough and who would take
any pains yea think it price
to become thy sacrifice
that distil their husbands land
in decoctions and are mand
with ten empricks in their chamber
lying for the spirit of amber
that for the oyl of talck dare spend
more than citizens dare lend
them and all their officers
that to make all pleasure theirs
will by coach and water go
every stew in town to know
dare entail their loves on any
bald or blind or nere so many
and for thee at common game
play away health wealth and fame
these disease will thee deserve
and will long ere thou shouldst starve
on their bed most prostitute
move it as their humblest sute
in thy justice to molest
none but them and leave the rest


drink to me only with thine eyes
and i will pledge with mine
or leave a kiss but in the cup
and ill not look for wine
the thirst that from the soul doth rise
doth ask a drink divine
but might i of joves nectar sup
i would not change for thine
i sent thee late a rosy wreath
not so much honoring thee
as giving it a hope that there
it could not withered be
but thou thereon didst only breathe
and sentst it back to me
since when it grows and smells i swear
not of it self but thee


and must i sing what subject shall i choose
or whose great name in poets heaven use
for the more countenance to my active muse


hercules alas his bones are yet sore
with his old earthly labours texact more
of his dull godhead were sin ill implore


phbus no tend thy cart still envious day
shall not give out that i have made thee stay
and foundred thy hot team to tune my lay


nor will i beg of thee lord of the vine
to raise my spirits with thy conjuring wine
in the green circle of the ivy twine


pallas nor thee i call on mankind maid
that at thy birth madst the poor smith affraid
who with his ax thy fathers midwife plaid


go cramp dull mars light venus when he snorts
or with thy tribade trine invent new sports
thou nor thy loosness with my making sorts


let the old boy your son ply his old task
turn the stale prologue to some painted mask
his absence in my verse is all i ask


hermes the cheater shall not mix with us
though he would steal his sisters pegasus
and rifle him or pawn his petasus


nor all the ladies of the thespian lake
though they were crusht into one form could make
a beauty of that merit that should take


my muse up by commission no i bring
my own true fire now my thought takes wing
and now an epode to deep ears i sing


now after all let no man
receive it for a fable
if a bird so amiable
do turn into a woman


or by our turtles augure
that natures fairest creature
prove of his mistress feature
but a bare type and figure


splendor o more than mortal
for other forms come short all
of her illustrious brightness
as far as sins from lightness


her wit as quick and sprightful
as fire and more delightful
than the stolen sports of lovers
when night their meeting covers


judgment adornd with learning
doth shine in her discerning
clear as a naked vestal
closed in an orb of crystal


her breath for sweet exceeding
the phoenix place of breeding
but mixd with sound transcending
all nature of commending


alas then whither wade i
in thought to praise this lady
when seeking her renowning
my self am so near drowning


retire and say her graces
are deeper than their faces
yet shes not nice to show them
nor takes she pride to know them


not to know vice at all and keep true state
is virtue and not fate
next to that virtue is to know vice well
and her black spight expel
which to effect since no breast is so sure
or safe but shell procure
some way of entrance we must plant a guard
of thoughts to watch and ward
at theye and ear the ports unto the mind
that no strange or unkind
object arrive there but the heart our spy
give knowledge instantly
to wakeful reason our affections king
who in thexamining
will quickly taste the reason and commit
close the close cause of it
tis the securest policy we have
to make our sense our slave
but this true course is not embracd by many
by many scarce by any
for either our affections do rebel
or else the sentinel
that should ring larum to the heart doth sleep
or some great thought doth keep
back the intelligence and falsly swears
thare base and idle fears
whereof the loyal conscience so complains
thus by these subtile trains
do several passions invade the mind
and strike our reason blind
of which usurping rank some have thought love
the first as prone to move
most frequent tumults horrors and unrests
in our enflamed breasts
but this doth from the cloud of error grow
which thus we overblow
the thing they here call love is blind desire
armd with bow shafts and fire
inconstant like the sea of whence tis born
rough swelling like a storm
with whom who sails rides on the surge of fear
and boils as if he were
in a continual tempest now true love
no such effects doth prove
that is an essence far more gentle fine
pure perfect nay divine
it is a golden chain let down from heaven
whose links are bright and even
that falls like sleep on lovers and combines
the soft and sweetest minds
in equal knots this bears no brands nor darts
to murther different hearts
but in a calm and godlike unity
preserves community


o who is he that in this peace enjoys
th elixir of all joys
a form more fresh than are the eden bowers
and lasting as her flowers
richer than time and as times virtue rare
sober as saddest care
a fixed thought an eye untaught to glance
who blest with such high chance
would at suggestion of a steep desire
cast himself from the spire
of all his happiness but soft i hear
some vicious fool draw near
that cries we dream and swears theres no such thing
as this chaste love we sing
peace luxury thou art like one of those
who being at sea suppose
because they move the continent doth so
no vice we let thee know
tho thy wild thoughts with sparrows wings do flie
turtles can chastly die
and yet in this texpress our selves more clear
we do not number here
such spirits as are only continent
because lusts means are spent
or those who doubt the common mouth of fame
and for their place and name
cannot so safely sin their chastity
is meer necessity
nor mean we those whom vows and conscience
have filld with abstinence
tho we acknowledg who can so abstain
makes a most blessed gain
he that for love of goodness hateth ill
is more crownworthy still
than he which for sins penalty forbears
his heart sins tho he fears
but we propose a person like our dove
gracd with a phnix love
a beauty of that clear and sparkling light
would make a day of night
and turn the blackest sorrows to bright joys
whose odrous breath destroys
all taste of bitterness and makes the air
as sweet as she is fair
a body so harmoniously composd
as if nature disclosd
all her best symmetry in that one feature
o so divine a creature
who could be false to chiefly when he knows
how only she bestows
the wealthy treasure of her love on him
making his fortunes swim
in the full flood of her admird perfection
what savage brute affection
would not be fearful to offend a dame
of this excelling frame
much more a noble and right generous mind
to vertuous moods inclind
that knows the weight of guilt he will refrain
from thoughts of such a strain
and to his sense object this sentence ever
man may securely sin but safely never


whilst that for which all vertue now is sold
and almost every vice almighty gold
that which to boot with hell is thought worth heaven
and for it life conscience yea souls are given
toyles by grave custom up and down the court
to every squire or groom that will report
well or ill only all the following year
just to the weight their this days presents bear
while it makes huishers serviceable men
and some one apteth to be trusted then
though never after whiles it gains the voice
of some grand peer whose air doth make rejoice
the fool that gave it who will want and weep
when his proud patrons favours are asleep
while thus it buys great graeegrace and hunts poor fame
runs between man and man tween dame and dame
solders crackt friendship makes love last a day
or perhaps less whilst gold bears all this sway
i that have none to send you send you verse
a present which if elder writs reherse
the truth of times was once of more esteem
than this our guilt nor golden age can deem
when gold was made no weapon to cut throats
or put to flight astrea when her ingots
were yet unfound and better placd in earth
than here to give pride fame and peasants birth
but let this dross carry what price it will
with noble ignorants and let them still
turn upon scorned verse their quarterface
with you i know my offring will find grace
for what a sin gainst your great fathers spirit
were it to think that you should not inherit
his love unto the muses when his skill
almost you have or may have when you will
wherein wise nature you a dowry gave
worth an estate treble to that you have
beauty i know is good and blood is more
riches thought most but madam think what store
the world hath seen which all these had in trust
and now lie lost in their forgotten dust
it is the muse alone can raise to heaven
and at her strong arms end hold up and even
the souls she loves those other glorious notes
inscribd in touch or marble or the cotes
painted or carvd upon our great mens tombs
or in their windows do but prove the wombs
that bred them graves when they were born they dyd
that had no muse to make their fame abide
how many equal with the argive queen
have beauty known yet none so famous seen
achilles was not first that valiant was
or in an armys head that lockt in brass
gave killing strokes there were brave men before
ajax or idomen or all the store
that homer brought to troy yet none so live
because they lackd the sacred pen could give
like life unto em who heavd hercules
unto the stars or the tyndarides
who placed jasons argo in the sky
or set bright ariadnes crown so high
who made a lamp of berenices hair
or lifted cassiopea in her chair
but only poets rapt with rage divine
and such or my hopes fail shall make you shine
you and that other star that purest light
of all lucinas train lucy the bright
than which a nobler heaven itself knows not
who though she have a better verser got
or poet in the court account than i
and who doth me though i not him envy
yet for the timely favours she hath done
to my less sanguine muse wherein she hath won
my grateful soul the subject of her powers
i have already usd some happy hours
to her remembrance which when time shall bring
to curious light to notes i then shall sing
will prove old orpheus act no tale to be
for i shall move stocks stones no less than he
then all that have but done my muse least grace
shall thronging come and boast the happy place
they hold in my strange poems which as yet
had not their form touchd by an english wit
there like a rich and golden pyramid
born up by statues shall i rear your head
above your undercarved ornaments
and shew how to the life my soul presents
your form imprest there not with tickling rhymes
or commonplaces filchd that take these times
but high and noble matter such as flies
from brains entrancd and filld with extasies
moods which the godlike sydney oft did prove
and your brave friend and mine so well did love


ti s grown almost a danger to speak true
of any good mind now there are so few
the bad by number are so fortifyd
as what theyve lost texpect they dare deride
so both the praisd and praisers suffer yet
for others ill ought none their good forget
i therefore who profess my self in love
with every virtue wheresore it move
and howsoever as i am at feud
with sin and vice though with a throne endud
and in this name am given out dangerous
by arts and practice of the vicious
such as suspect themselves and think it fit
for their own captal crimes tindite my wit
i that have sufferd this and though forsook
of fortune have not alterd yet my look
or so my self abandond as because
men are not just or keep no holy laws
of nature and society i should faint
or fear to draw true lines cause others paint
i madam am become your praiser where
if it may stand with your soft blush to hear
your self but told unto your self and see
in my character what your features be
you will not from the paper slightly pass
no lady but at sometime loves her glass
and this shall be no false one but as much
removd as you from need to have it such
look then and see your self i will not say
your beauty for you see that every day
and so do many more all which can call
it perfect proper pure and natural
not taken up othdoctors but as well
as i can say and see it doth excel
that asks but to be censurd by the eyes
and in those outward forms all fools are wise
nor that your beauty wanted not a dower
do i reflect some alderman has power
or cosning farmer of the customs so
tadvance his doubtful issue and oreflow
a princes fortune these are gifts of chance
and raise not virtue they may vice enhance
my mirror is more subtil clear refind
and takes and gives the beauties of the mind
though it reject not those of fortune such
as blood and match wherein how more than much
are you engaged to your happy fate
for such a lot that mixt you with a state
of so great title birth but virtue most
without which all the rest were sounds or lost
tis only that can time and chance defeat
for he that once is good is ever great
wherewith then madam can you better pay
this blessing of your stars than by that way
of virtue which you tread what if alone
without companions tis safe to have none
in single paths dangers with ease are watchd
contagion in the preasealternate spelling of press is soonest catchd
this makes that wisely you decline your life
far from the maze of custom error strife
and keep an even and unhalterd gait
not looking by or back like those that wait
times and occasions to start forth and seem
which though the turning world may disesteem
because that studies spectacles and shows
and after varied as fresh objects goes
giddy with change and therefore cannot see
right the right way yet must your comfort be
your conscience and not wonder if none asks
for truths complexion where they all wear masks
let who will follow fashions and attires
maintain their liedgers forth for foreign wyres
melt down their husbands land to pour away
on the close groom and page on newyears day
and almost all days after while they live
they find it both so witty and safe to give
letem on poulders oyls and paintings spend
till that no usurer nor his bawds dare lend
them or their officers and no man know
whether it be a face they wear or no
let em waste body and state and after all
when their own parasites laugh at their fall
may they have nothing left whereof they can
boast but how oft they have gone wrong to man
and call it their brave sin for such there be
that do sin only for the infamy
and never think how vice doth every hour
eat on her clients and some one devour
you madam young have learnd to shun these shelves
whereon the most of mankind wreck themselves
and keeping a just course have early put
into your harbour and all passage shut
gainst storms or pirats that might charge your peace
for which you worthy are the glad increase
of your blest womb made fruitful from above
to pay your lord the pledges of chaste love
and raise a noble stem to give the fame
to cliftons blood that is denyd their name
grow grow fair tree and as thy branches shoot
hear what the muses sing above thy root
by me their priest if they can ought divine
before the moons have filld their triple trine
to crown the burden which you go withall
it shall a ripe and timely issue fall
texpect the honours of great aubigny
and greater rites yet writ in mystery
but which the fates forbid me to reveal
only thus much out of a ravishd zeal
unto your name and goodness of your life
they speak since you are truly that rare wife
other great wives may blush at when they see
what your tryd manners are what theirs should be
how you love one and him you should how still
you are depending on his word and will
not fashiond for the court or strangers eyes
but to preaseplease him who is the dearer prize
unto himself by being so dear to you
this makes that your affections still be new
and that your souls conspire as they were gone
each into other and had now made one
live that one still and as long years do pass
madam be bold to use this truest glass
wherein your form you still the same shall find
because nor it can change nor such a mind


no w that the hearth is crownd with smiling fire
and some do drink and some do dance
some ring
some sing
and all do strive tadvance
the gladness higher
wherefore should i
stand silent by
who not the least
both love the cause and authors of the feast


give me my cup but from the thespian well
that i may tell to sydney what
this day
doth say
and he may think on that
which i do tell
when all the noise
of these forcd joys
are fled and gone
and he with his best genius left alone


this day says then the number of glad years
are justly summd that make you man
your vow
must now
strive all right ways it can
toutstrip your peers
since he doth lack
of going back
little whose will
doth urge him to run wrong or to stand still


nor can a little of the common store
of nobles virtue shew in you
your blood
so good
and great must seek for new
and study more
nor weary rest
on whats deceast
for they that swell
with dust of ancestors in graves but dwell


twill be exacted of your name whose son
whose nephew whose grandchild you are
and men
will then
say you have followd far
when well begun
which must be now
they teach you how
and he that stays
to live until to morrowhath lost two days


so may you live in honour as in name
if with this truth you be inspird
so may
this day
be more and long desird
and with the flame
of love be bright
as with the light
of bonfires then
the birthday shines when logs not burn but men


good and great god can i not think of thee
but it must straight my melancholy be
is it interpreted in me disease
that laden with my sins i seek for ease
o be thou witness that the reins dost know
and hearts of all if i be sad for show
and judge me after if i dare pretend
to ought but grace or aim at other end
as thou art all so be thou all to me
first midst and last converted one and three
my faith my hope my love and in this state
my judge my witness and my advocate
where have i been this while exild from thee
and whither rapt now thou but stoupst to me
dwell dwell here still o being everywhere
how can i doubt to find thee ever here
i know my state both full of shame and scorn
conceivd in sin and unto labour born
standing with fear and must with horror fall
and destind unto judgment after all
i feel my griefs too and there scarce is ground
upon my flesh tinflict another wound
yet dare i not complain or wish for death
with holy paul lest it be thought the breath
of discontent or that these prayers be
for weariness of life not love of thee


oholy blessed glorious trinity
of persons still one god in unity
the faithful mans believed mystery
help help to lift
my self up to thee harrowd torn and bruisd
by sin and sathan and my flesh misusd
as my heart lies in pieces all confusd
o take my gift


allgracious god the sinners sacrifice
a broken heart thou wert not wont despise
but bove the fat of rams or bulls to prize
an offring meet
for thy acceptance o behold me right
and take compassion on my grievous plight
what odour can be than a heart contrite
to thee more sweet


eternal father god who didst create
this all of nothing gavest it form and fate
and breathst into it life and light with state
to worship thee
eternal god the son who not denydst
to take our nature becamst man and dydst
to pay our debts upon thy cross and crydst
alls done in me


eternal spirit god from both proceeding
father and son the comforter in breeding
pure thoughts in man with fiery zeal them feeding
for acts of grace
increase those acts o glorious trinity
of persons still one god in unity
till i attain the longdfor mystery
of seeing your face


my maker saviour and my sanctifier
to hear to meditate sweeten my desire
with grace with love with cherishing intire
o then how blest
among thy saints elected to abide
and with thy angels placed side by side
but in thy presence truly glorified
shall i there rest


hear me o god
a broken heart
is my best part
use still thy rod
that i may prove
therein thy love


if thou hadst not
been stern to me
but left me free
i had forgot
my self and thee


for sins so sweet
as minds ill bent
rarely repent
until they meet
their punishment


who more can crave
than thou hast done
that gavst a son
to free a slave
first made of nought
withall since bought


sin death and hell
his glorious name
quite overcame
yet i rebel
and slight the same


but ill come in
before my loss
me farther toss
as sure to win
under his cross


ising the birth was born to night
the author both of life and light
the angels so did sound it
and like the ravishd sheperds said
who saw the light and were afraid
yet searchd and true they found it


the son of god th eternal king
that did us all salvation bring
and fred the soul from danger
he whom the whole world could not take
the word which heaven and earth did make
was now laid in a manger


the fathers wisdom willd it so
the sons obedience knew no no
both wills were in one stature
and as that wisdom had decred
the word was now made flesh indeed
and took on him our nature


what comfort by him do we win
who made himself the price of sin
to make us heirs of glory
to see this babe all innocence
a martyr born in our defence
can man forget this story


let it not your wonder move
less your laughter that i love
though i now write fifty years
i have had and have my peers
poets though divine are men
some have lovd as old agen
and it is not always face
clothes or fortune gives the grace
or the feature or the youth
but the language and the truth
with the ardor and the passion
gives the lover weight and fashion
if you then will read the story
first prepare you to be sorry
that you never knew till now
either whom to love or how
but be glad as soon with me
when you know that this is she
of whose beauty it was sung
she shall make the old man young
keep the middle age at stay
and let nothing high decay
till she be the reason why
all the world for love may die


ibeheld her on a day
when her look outflourisht may
and her dressing did outbrave
all the pride the fields then have
far i was from being stupid
for i ran and calld on cupid
love if thou wilt ever see
mark of glory come with me
wheres thy quiver bend thy bow
heres a shaft thou art too slow
and withal i did untie
every cloud about his eye
but he had not gaind his sight
sooner than he lost his might
or his courage for away
strait he ran and durst not stay
letting bow and arrow fall
nor for any threat or call
could be brought once back to look
i foolhardy there up took
both the arrow he had quit
and the bow which thought to hit
this my object but she threw
such a lightning as i drew
at my face that took my sight
and my motion from me quite
so that there i stood a stone
mockd of all and calld of one
which with grief and wrath i heard
cupids statue with a beard
or else one that plaid his ape
in a hercules his shape


after many scorns like these
which the prouder beauties please
she content was to restore
eyes and limbs to hurt me more
and would on conditions be
reconcild to love and me
first that i must kneeling yield
both the bow and shaft i held
unto her which love might take
at her hand with oath to make
me the scope of his next draught
aimed with that selfsame shaft
he no sooner heard the law
but the arrow home did draw
and to gain her by his art
left it sticking in my heart
which when she beheld to bleed
she repented of the deed
and would fain have changd the fate
but the pity comes too late
looserlike now all my wreak
is that i have leave to speak
and in either prose or song
to revenge me with my tongue
which how dexterously i do
hear and make example too


see the chariot at hand here of love
wherein my lady rideth
each that draws is a swan or a dove
and well the car love guideth
as she goes all hearts do duty
unto her beauty
and enamourd do wish so they might
but enjoy such a sight
that they still were to run by her side
through swords through seas whither she would ride


do but look on her eyes they do light
all that loves world compriseth
do but look on her hair it is bright
as loves star when it riseth
do but mark her foreheads smoother
than words that sooth her
and from her arched brows such a grace
sheds it self through the face
as alone there triumphs to the life
all the gain all the good of the elements strife


have you seen but a bright lily grow
before rude hands have touchd it
ha you markd but the fall o the snow
before the soyl hath smutchd it
ha you felt the wooll of bever
or swans down ever
or have smelt o the bud o the briar
or the nard in the fire
or have tasted the bag of the bee
o so white o so soft o so sweet is she


noblest charis you that are
both my fortune and my star
and do govern more my blood
than the various moon the flood
hear what late discourse of you
love and i have had and true
mongst my muses finding me
where he chanct your name to see
set and to this softer strain
sure said he if i have brain
this here sung can be no other
by description but my mother
so hath homer praisd her hair
so anacreon drawn the air
of her face and made to rise
just about her sparkling eyes
both her brows bent like my bow
by her looks i do her know
which you call my shafts and see
such my mothers blushes be
as the bath your verse discloses
in her cheeks of milk and roses
such as oft i wanton in
and above her even chin
have you placd the bank of kisses
where you say men gather blisses
ripned with a breath more sweet
than when flowers and westwinds meet
nay her white and polishd neck
with the lace that doth it deck
is my mothers hearts of slain
lovers made into a chain
and between each rising breast
lies the valley calld my nest
where i sit and preen my wings
after flight and put new stings
to my shafts her very name
with my mothers is the same
i confess all i replyd
and the glass hangs by her side
and the girdle bout her waste
all is venus save unchaste
but alas thou seest the least
of her good who is the best
of her sex but couldst thou love
call to mind the forms that strove
for the apple and those three
make in one the same were she
for this beauty yet doth hide
something more than thou hast spid
outward grace weak love beguiles
she is venus when she smiles
but shes juno when she walks
and minerva when she talks


charis guess and do not miss
since i drew a morning kiss
from your lips and suckd an air
thence as sweet as you are fair
what my muse and i have done
whether we have lost or won
if by us the odds were laid
that the bride allowd a maid
lookd not half so fresh and fair
with th advantage of her hair
and her jewels to the view
of th assembly as did you
or that did you sit or walk
you were more the eye and talk
of the court to day than all
else that glisterd in whitehall
so as those that had your sight
wisht the bride were changd to night
and did think such rites were due
to no other grace but you
or if you did move to night
in the dances with what spight
of your peers you were beheld
that at every motion swelld
so to see a lady tread
as might all the graces lead
and was worthy being so seen
to be envid of the queen
or if you would yet have stayd
whether any would upbraid
to himself his loss of time
or have chargd his sight of crime
to have left all sight for you
guess of these which is the true
and if such a verse as this
may not claim another kiss


for lovessake kiss me once again
i long and should not beg in vain
heres none to spy or see
why do you doubt or stay
ill taste as lightly as the bee
that doth but touch his flower and flies away


once more and faith i will be gone
can he that loves ask less than one
nay you may err in this
and all your bounty wrong
this could be calld but half a kiss
what we re but once to do we should do long


i will but mend the last and tell
where how it would have relishd well
joyn lip to lip and try
each suck others breath
and whilst our tongues perplexed lie
let who will think us dead or wish our death


charis one day in discourse
had of love and of his force
lightly promisd she would tell
what a man she could love well
and that promise set on fire
all that heard her with desire
with the rest i long expected
when the work would be effected
but we find that cold delay
and excuse spun every day
as until she tell her one
we all fear she loveth none
therefore charis you must dot
for i will so urge you tot
you shall neither eat nor sleep
no nor forth your window peep
with your emissary eye
to fetch in the forms go by
and pronounce which band or lace
better fits him than his face
nay i will not let you sit
fore your idol glass a whit
to say over every purl
there or to reform a curl
or with secretary sis
to consult if fucus this
be as good as was the last
all your sweet of life is past
make accompt unless you can
and that quickly speak your man


of your trouble ben to ease me
i will tell what man would please me
i would have him if i could
noble or of greater blood
titles i confess do take me
and a woman god did make me
french to boot at least in fashion
and his manners of that nation
young ild have him too and fair
yet a man with crisped hair
cast in thousand snares and rings
for loves fingers and his wings
chesnut colour or more slack
gold upon a ground of black
venus and minervas eyes
for he must look wantonwise
eyebrows bent like cupids bow
front an ample field of snow
even nose and cheek withal
smooth as is the billiard ball
chin as woolly as the peach
and his lip should kissing teach
till he cherishd too much beard
and make love or me afeard
he would have a hand as soft
as the down and shew it oft
skin as smooth as any rush
and so thin to see a blush
rising through it ere it came
all his blood should be a flame
quickly fird as in beginners
in loves school and yet no sinners
twere too long to speak of all
what we harmony do call
in a body should be there
well he should his clothes to wear
yet no taylor help to make him
drest you still for man should take him
and not think h had eat a stake
or were set up in a brake
valiant he should be as fire
shewing danger more than ire
bounteous as the clouds to earth
and as honest as his birth
all his actions to be such
as to do nothing too much
nor oerpraise nor yet condem
nor outvalue nor contemn
nor do wrongs nor wrongs receive
nor tie knots nor knots unweave
and from baseness to be free
as he durst love truth and me
such a man with every part
i could give my very heart
but of one if short he came
i can rest me where i am


for his mind i do not care
thats a toy that i could spare
let his title be but great
his clothes rich and band sit neat
himself young and face be good
all i wish is understood
what you please you parts may call
tis one good part ild lie withal


come with our voices let us war
and challenge all the sphears
till each of us be made a star
and all the world turn ears


at such a call what beast or fowl
of reason empty is
what tree or stone doth want a soul
what man but must lose his


mix then your notes that we may prove
to stay the running floods
to make the mountain quarries move
and call the walking woods


what need of me do you but sing
sleep and the grave will wake
no tunes are sweet nor words have sting
but what those lips do make


they say the angels mark each deed
and exercise below
and out of inward pleasure feed
on what they viewing know


o sing not you then lest the best
of angels should be driven
to fall again at such a feast
mistaking earth for heaven


nay rather both our souls be straind
to meet their high desire
so they in state of grace retaind
may wish us of their quire


oh do not wanton with those eyes
lest i be sick with seeing
nor cast them down but let them rise
lest shame destroy their being


o be not angry with those fires
for then their threats will kill me
nor look too kind on my desires
for then my hopes will spill me


o do not steep them in thy tears
for so will sorrow slay me
nor spread them as distract with fears
mine own enough betray me


men if you love us play no more
the fools or tyrants with your friends
to make us still sing oer and oer
our own false praises for your ends
we have both wits and fancies too
and if we must lets sing of you


nor do we doubt but that we can
if we would search with care and pain
find some one good in some one man
so going thorow all your strain
we shall at last of parcels make
one good enough for a songs sake


and as a cunning painter takes
in any curious piece you see
more pleasure while the thing he makes
than when tis made why so will we
and having pleasd our art well try
to make a new and hang that by


hang up those dull and envious fools
that talk abroad of womans change
we were not bred to sit on stools
our proper vertue is to range
take that away you take our lives
we are no women then but wives


such as in valour would excel
do change though man and often fight
which we in love must do as well
if ever we will love aright
the frequent varying of the deed
is that which doth perfection breed


nor ist inconstancy to change
for what is better or to make
by searching what before was strange
familiar for the uses sake
the good from bad is not descrid
but as tis often vext and trid
and this profession of a store
in love doth not alone help forth
our pleasure but preserves us more
from being forsaken than doth worth
for were the worthiest woman curst
to love one man hed leave her first


ilove and he loves me again
yet dare i not tell who
for if the nymphs should know my swain
i fear theyd love him too
yet if it be not known
the pleasure is as good as none
for thats a narrow joy is but our own


ill tell that if they be not glad
they yet may envy me
but then if i grow jealous mad
and of them pitied be
it were a plague bove scorn
and yet it cannot be forborn
unless my heart would as my thought be torn


he is if they can find him fair
and fresh and fragrant too
as summers sky or purged air
and looks as lilies do
that are this morning blown
yet yet i doubt he is not known
and fear much more that more of him be shown


but he hath eyes so round and bright
as make away my doubt
where love may all his torches light
though hate had put them out
but then t increase my fears
what nymph soeer his voice but hears
will be my rival though she have but ears


ill tell no more and yet i love
and he loves me yet no
one unbecoming thought doth move
from either heart i know
but so exempt from blame
as it would be to each a fame
if love or fear would let me tell his name


and in his mrsmistress flame playing like a fly
turnd to cinders by her eye
yes and in death as life unblest
to havet exprest
even ashes of lovers find no rest


inow think love is rather deaf than blind
for else it could not be
that she
whom i adore so much should so slight me
and cast my love behind


im sure my language to her was as sweet
and every close did meet
in sentence of as subtil feet
as hath the youngest he
that sits in shadow of apollos tree
oh but my conscious fears
that fly my thoughts between
tell me that she hath seen
my hundreds of gray hairs
told seven and forty years
read so much waste as she cannot embrace
my mountain belly and my rocky face
and all these through her eyes have stopt her ears


wretched and foolish jealousie
how camst thou thus to enter me
i neer was of thy kind
nor have i yet the narrow mind
to vent that poor desire
that others should not warm them at my fire
i wish the sun should shine
on all mens fruits and flowers as well as mine


but under the disguise of love
thou sayst thou only camst to prove
what my affections were
thinkst thou that love is helpd by fear
go get thee quickly forth
loves sickness and his noted want of worth
seek doubting men to please
i neer will owe my health to a disease


or scorn or pity on me take
i must the true relation make
i am undone to night
love in a subtil dream disguisd
hath both my heart and me surprisd
whom never yet he durst attempt t awake
nor will he tell me for whose sake
he did me the delight
or spight
but leaves me to inquire
in all my wild desire
of sleep again who was his aid
and sleep so guilty and afraid
as since he dares not come within my sight


ihave my piety too which could
it vent it self but as it would
would say as much as both have done
before me here the friend and son
for i both lost a friend and father
of him whose bones this grave doth gather
dear vincent corbet who so long
had wrestled with diseases strong
that though they did possess each limb
yet he broke them ere they could him
with the just canon of his life
a life that knew nor noise nor strife
but was by sweetning so his will
all order and disposure still
his mind as pure and neatly kept
as were his nourceries and swept
so of uncleanness or offence
that never came ill odour thence


and add his actions unto these
they were as specious as his trees
tis true he could not reprehend
his very manners taught t amend
they were so even grave and holy
no stubbornness so stiff nor folly
to license ever was so light
as twice to trespass in his sight
his looks would so correct it when
it chid the vice yet not the men
much from him i profess i won
and more and more i should have done
but that i understood him scant
now i conceive him by my want
and pray who shall my sorrows read
that they for me their tears will shed
for truly since he left to be
i feel im rather dead than he


reader whose life and name did eer become
an epitaph deservd a tomb
nor wants it here through penury or sloth
who makes the one so t be first makes both


if sackvile all that have the power to do
great and good turns as well could time them too
and knew their how and where we should have then
less list of proud hard or ingrateful men
for benefits are owd with the same mind
as they are done and such returns they find
you then whose will not only but desire
to succour my necessities took fire
not at my prayers but your sense which laid
the way to meet what others would upbraid
and in the act did so my blush prevent
as i did feel it done as soon as meant
you cannot doubt but i who freely know
this good from you as freely will it owe
and though my fortune humble me to take
the smallest courtesies with thanks i make
yet choice from whom i take them and would shame
to have such do me good i durst not name
they are the noblest benefits and sink
deepest in man of which when he doth think
the memory delights him more from whom
then what he hath receivd gifts stink from some
they are so long a coming and so hard
where any deed is forct the grace is marrd
can i owe thanks for courtesies receivd
against his will that does em that hath weavd
excuses or delays or done em scant
that they have more opprest me than my want
or if he did it not to succour me
but by meer chance for interest or to free
himself of farther trouble or the weight
of pressure like one taken in a streight
all this corrupts the thanks less hath he won
that puts it in his debtbook eret be done
or that doth sound a trumpet and doth call
his grooms to witness or else lets it fall
in that proud manner as a good so gaind
must make me sad for what i have obtaind
no gifts and thanks should have one cheerful face
so each thats done and tane becomes a brace
he neither gives or dos that doth delay
a benefit or that doth throwt away
no more than he doth thank that will receive
nought but in corners and is loth to leave
lestrare form of least air or print but flies it such men would
run from the conscience of it if they could


as i have seen some infants of the sword
well known and practisd borrowers on their word
give thanks by stealth and whispering in the ear
for what they straight would to the world forswear
and speaking worst of those from whom they went
but then fistfilld to put me off the scent
now dam me sir if you shall not command
my sword tis but a poor sword understand
as far as any poor sword i the land
then turning unto him is next at hand
dams whom he damnd too is the veriest gull
has feathers and will serve a man to pull
are they not worthy to be answerd so
that to such natures let their full hands flow
and seek not wants to succour but enquire
like moneybrokers after names and hire
their bounties forth to him that last was made
or stands to ben commission o the blade
still still the hunters of false fame apply
their thoughts and means to making loud the cry
but one is bitten by the dog he fed
and hurt seeks cure the surgeon bids take bread
and spungelike with it dry up the blood quite
then give it to the hound that did him bite
pardon says he that were a way to see
all the towncurs take each their snatch at me
o is it so knows he so much and will
feed those at whom the table points at still
i not deny it but to help the need
of any is a great and generous deed
yea of th ingrateful and he forth must tell
many a pound and piece will pace one well
but these men ever want their very trade
is borrowing that but stopt they do invade
all as their prize turn pyrates here at land
ha their bermudas and their streights i th strand
man out of their boats to th temple and not shift
now but command make tribute what was gift
and it is paid em with a trembling zeal
and superstition i dare scarce reveal
if it were clear but being so in cloud
carried and wrapt i only am alowd
my wonder why the taking a clowns purse
or robbing the poor marketfolks should nurse
such a religious horror in the breasts
of our towngallantry or why there rests
such worship due to kicking of a punck
or swaggering with the watch or drawer drunk
or feats of darkness acted in midsun
and told of with more license than th were done
sure there is mystery in it i not know
that men such reverence to such actions show
and almost deifie the authors make
loud sacrifice of drink for their healthssake
rear suppers in their names and spend whole nights
unto their praise in certain swearing rites
cannot a man be reckned in the state
of valour but at this idolatrous rate
i thought that fortitude had been a mean
twixt fear and rashness not a lust obscene
or appetite of offending but a skill
or science of a discerning good and ill
and you sir know it well to whom i write
that with these mixtures we put out her light
her ends are honesty and publick good
and where they want she is not understood
no more are these of us let them then go
i have the list of mine own faults to know
look too and cure hes not a man hath none
but like to be that every day mends one
and feels it else he tarries by the beast
can i discern how shadows are decreast
or grown by height or lowness of the sun
and can i less of substance when i run


ride sail am coachd know i how far i have gone
and my minds motion not or have i none
no he must feel and know that i will advance
men have been great but never good by chance
or on the sudden it were strange that he
who was this morning such a one should be
sydney ere night or that did go to bed
coriat should rise the most sufficient head
of christendom and neither of these know
were the rack offerd them how they came so
tis by degrees that men arrive at glad
profit in ought each day some little add
in time twill be a heap this is not true
alone in money but in manners too
yet we must more than move still or go on
we must accomplish tis the last keystone
that makes the arch the rest that there were put
are nothing till that comes to bind and shut
then stands it a triumphal mark then men
observe the strength the height the why and when
it was erected and still walking under
meet some new matter to look up and wonder
such notes are vertuous men they live as fast
as they are high are rooted and will last
they need no stilts nor rise upon their toes
as if they would belie their stature those
are dwarfs of honour and have neither weight
nor fashion if they chance aspire to height
tis like light canes that first rise big and brave
shoot forth in smooth and comely spaces have
but few and fair divisions but being got
aloft grow less and streightned full of knot
and last go out in nothing you that see
their difference cannot choose which you will be
you know without my flattring you too much
for me to be your indice keep you such
that i may love your person as i do
without your gift though i can rate that too
by thanking thus the courtesie to life
which you will bury but therein the strife
may grow so great to be example when
as their true rule or lesson either men
donnors or donnees to their practice shall
find you to reckon nothing me owe all


iknow to whom i write here i am sure
though i am short i cannot be obscure
less shall i for the art or dressing care
truth and the graces best when naked are
your book my selden i have read and much
was trusted that you thought my judgment such
to ask it though in most of works it be
a penance where a man may not be free
rather than office when it doth or may
chance that the friends affection proves allay
unto the censure yours all need doth fly
of this so vitious humanity
than which there is not unto study a more
pernicious enemy we see before
a many of books even good judgments wound
themselves through favouring what is there not found
but i on yours far otherwise shall do
not fly the crime but the suspicion too
though i confess as every muse hath errd
and mine not least i have too oft preferrd
men past their terms and praisd some names too much
but twas with purpose to have made them such
since being deceivd i turn a sharper eye
upon my self and ask to whom and why
and what i write and vex it many days
before men get a verse much less a praise


so that my reader is assurd i now
mean what i speak and still will keep that vow
stand forth my object then you that have been
ever at home yet have all countries seen
and like a compass keeping one foot still
upon your center do your circle fill
of general knowledge watchd men manners too
heard what times past have said seen what ours do
which grace shall i make love to first your skill
or faith in things or ist your wealth and will
t instruct and teach or your unwearyd pain
of gathering bounty in pouring out again
what fables have you vext what truth redeemd
antiquities searchd opinions disesteemd
impostures branded and authorities urgd
what blots and errors have you watchd and purgd
records and authors of how rectified
times manners customs innovations spied
sought out the fountains sources creeks paths ways
and noted the beginnings and decays
where is that nominal mark or real rite
form act or ensign that hath scapd your sight
how are traditions there examind how
conjectures retreivd and a story now
and then of times besides the bare conduct
of what it tells us weavd in to instruct
i wonderd at the richness but am lost
to see the workmanship so xceed the cost
to mark the excellent seasning of your stile
and manly elocution not one while
with horror rough then rioting with wit
but to the subject still the colours fit
in sharpness of all search wisdom of choice
newness of sense antiquity of voice
i yeild i yeild the matter of your praise
flows in upon me and i cannot raise
a bank against it nothing but the round
large clasp of nature such a wit can bound
monarch in letters mongst thy titles shown
of others honours thus enjoy their own
i first salute thee so and gratulate
with that thy stile thy keeping of thy state
in offering this thy work to no great name
that would perhaps have praisd and thankd the same
but nought beyond he thou hast given it to
thy learned chamberfellow knows to do
it true respects he will not only love
embrace and cherish but he can approve
and estimate thy pains as having wrought
in the same mines of knowledge and thence brought
humanity enough to be a friend
and strength to be a champion and defend
thy gift gainst envy o how i do count
among my comings in and see it mount
the grain of your two friendships hayward and
selden two names that so much understand
on whom i could take up and neer abuse
the credit what would furnish a tenth muse
but heres no time nor place my wealth to tell
you both are modest so am i farewel


wake friend from forth thy lethargy the drum
beats brave and loud in europe and bids come
all that dare rowse or are not loth to quit
their vitious ease and be oerwhelmd with it
it is a call to keep the spirits alive
that gasp for action and would yet revive
mans buried honour in his sleepy life
quickning dead nature to her noblest strife


all other acts of worldlings are but toil
in dreams begun in hope and end in spoil
look on th ambitious man and see him nurse
his unjust hopes with praises beggd or worse
bought flatteries the issue of his purse
till he become both their and his own curse
look on the false and cunning man that loves
no person nor is lovd what ways he proves
to gain upon his belly and at last
crushd in the snaky brakes that he had past
see the grave sower and supercilious sir
in outward face but inward light as fur
or feathers lay his fortune out to show
till envy wound or maim it at a blow
see him thats calld and thought the happiest man
honourd at once and envyd if it can
be honour is so mixt by such as would
for all their spight be like him if they could
no part or corner man can look upon
but there are objects bid him to be gone
as far as he can fly or follow day
rather than here so boggd in vices stay
the whole world here leavend with madness swells
and being a thing blown out of nought rebels
against his maker high alone with weeds
and impious rankness of all sects and seeds
nor to be checkd or frighted now with fate
but more licentious made and desperate
our delicacies are grown capital
and even our sports are dangers what we call
friendship is now maskd hatred justice fled
and shamefacdness together all laws dead
that kept man living pleasures only sought
honour and honesty as poor things thought
as they are made pride and stiff clownage mixt
to make up greatness and mans whole good fixd
in bravery or gluttony or coyn
all which he makes the servants of the groin
thither it flawsflows how much did stallion spend
to have his courtbredfilly there commend
his lace and starch and fall upon her back
in admiration stretchd upon the rack
of lust to his rich suit and title lord
i thats a charm and half she must afford
that all respect she must lie down nay more
tis there civility to be a whore
hes one of blood and fashion and with these
the bravery makes she can no honour leese
to dot with cloth or stuffs lusts name might merit
with velvet plush and tissues it is spirit
o these so ignorant monsters light as proud
who can behold their manners and not clowd
like upon them lighten if nature could
not make a verse anger or laughter would
to see em aye discoursing with their glass
how they may make some one that day an ass
planting their purls and curls spread forth like net
and every dressing for a pitfall set
to catch the flesh in and to pound a prick
be at their visits see em squeamish sick
ready to cast at one whose band sits ill
and then leap mad on a neat pickardill
as if a brize were gotten i their tail
and firk and jerk and for the coachman rail
and jealous each of other yet think long
to be abroad chanting some bawdy song
and laugh and measure thighs then squeak spring itch
do all the tricks of a salt lady bitch
for tother pound of sweetmeats he shall feel
that pays or what he will the dame is steel
for these with her young company shell enter
where pittes or wright or modet would not venter
and comes by these degrees the stile t inherit
of woman of fashion and a lady of spirit


nor is the title questiond with our proud
great brave and fashiond folk these are allowd
adulteries now are not so hid or strange
theyre grown commodity upon exchange
he that will follow but anothers wife
is lovd though he let out his own for life
the husband nows calld churlish or a poor
nature that will not let his wife be a whore
or use all arts or haunt all companies
that may corrupt her even in his eyes
the brother trades a sister and the friend
lives to the lord but to the ladies end
less must not be thought on than mistris or
if it be thought killd like her embrions for
whom no great mistris hath as yet infamd
a fellow of course letchery is namd
the servant of the servingwoman in scorn
neer came to taste the plenteous marriagehorn
thus they do talk and are these objects fit
for man to spend his money on his wit
his time health soul will he for these go throw
those thousands on his back shall after blow
his body to the counters or the fleet
is it for these that fine man meets the street
coachd or on footcloth thrice changd every day
to teach each suit he has the ready way
from hidepark to the stage where at the last
his dear and borrowd bravery he must cast
when not his combs his curlingirons his glass
sweet bags sweet powders nor sweet words will pass
for less security o god for these
is it that man pulls on himself disease
surfeit and quarrel drinks the tother health
or by damnation voids it or by stealth
what fury of late is crept into our feasts
what honour given to the drunkennest guests
what reputation to bear one glass more
when oft the bearer is borne out of door
this hath our illusd freedom and soft peace
brought on us and will every hour increase
our vices do not tarry in a place
but being in motion still or rather in race
tilt one upon another and now bear
this way now that as if their number were
more than themselves or than our lives could take
but both fell prest under the load they make
ill bid thee look no more but flee flee friend
this prcipice and rocks that have no end
or side but threatens ruin the whole day
is not enough now but the nights to play
and whilst our states strength body and mind we waste
go make our selves the usurers at a cast
he that no more for age cramps palsies can
now use the bones we see doth hire a man
to take the box up for him and pursues
the dice with glassen eyes to the glad viewers views
of what he throws like letchers grown content
to be beholders when their powers are spent
can we not leave this worm or will we not
is that the truer excuse or have we got
in this and like an itch of vanity
that scratching nows our best felicity
well let it go yet this is better than
to lose the forms and dignities of menman
to flatter my good lord and cry his bowl
runs sweetly as it had his lordships soul
although perhaps it has whats that to me
that may stand by and hold my peace will he
when i am hoarse with praising his each cast
give me but that again that i must waste
in sugar candid or in butterd beer
for the recovery of my voice no there
pardon his lordship flattrys grown so cheap
with him for he is followed with that heap


that watch and catch at what they may applaud
as a poor single flatterer without bawd
is nothing such scarce meat and drink hell give
but he thats both and slave to both shall live
and be belovd while the whores last o times
friend fly from hence and let these kindled rhymes
light thee from hell on earth where flatterers spies
informers masters both of arts and lies
lewd slanderers soft whisperers that let blood
the life and fameveins yet not understood
of the poor sufferers where the envious proud
ambitious factious superstitious loud
boasters and perjurd with the infinite more
prvaricators swarm of which the store
because thare every where amongst mankind
spread through the world is easier far to find
than once to number or bring forth to hand
though thou wert mustermaster of the land
go quit em all and take along with thee
thy true friends wishes colby which shall be
that thine be just and honest that thy deeds
not wound thy conscience when thy body bleeds
that thou dost all things more for truth than glory
and never but for doing wrong be sorry
that by commanding first thy self thou makst
thy person fit for any charge thou takst
that fortune never make thee to complain
but what she gives thou darst give her again
that whatsoever face thy fate puts on
thou shrink or start not but be always one
that thou think nothing great but what is good
and from that thought strive to be understood
so live or dead thou wilt preserve a fame
still precious with the odour of thy name
and last blaspheme not we did never hear
man thought the valianter cause he durst swear
no more than we should think a lord had had
more honour in him cause weave known him mad
these take and now go seek thy peace in war
who falls for love of god shall rise a star


reader stay
and if i had no more to say
but here doth lie till the last day
all that is left of philip gray
it might thy patience richly pay
for if such men as he could die
what surety of life have thou and i


they are not sir worst owers that do pay
debts when they can good men may break their day
and yet the noble nature never grudge
tis then a crime when the usurer is judge
and he is not in friendship nothing there
is done for gain ift be tis not sincere
nor should i at this time protested be
but that some greater names have broke with me
and their words too where i but break my band
i add that but because i understand
that as the lesser breach for he that takes
simply my band his trust in me forsakes
and looks unto the forfeit if you be
now so much friend as you would trust in me
venture a longer time and willingly
all is not barren land doth fallow lie
some grounds are made the richer for the rest
and i will bring a crop if not the best


can beauty that did prompt me first to write
now threaten with those means she did invite
did her perfections call me on to gaze
then like then love and now would they amaze
or was she gracious afar off but near
a terror or is all this but my fear
that as the water makes things put int streight
crooked appear so that doth my conceit
i can help that with boldness and love swear
and fortune once t assist the spirits that dare
but which shall lead me on both these are blind
such guides men use not who their way would find
except the way be error to those ends
and then the best are still the blindest friends
oh how a lover may mistake to think
or love or fortune blind when they but wink
to see men fear or else for truth and state
because they would free justice imitate
vail their own eyes and would impartially
be brought by us to meet our destiny
if it be thus come love and fortune go
ill lead you on or if my fate will so
that i must send one first my choice assigns
love to my heart and fortune to my lines


by those bright eyes at whose immortal fires
love lights his torches to inflame desires
by that fair stand your forehead whence he bends
his double bow and round his arrows sends
by that tall grove your hair whose globy rings
he flying curles and crispeth with his wings
by those pure bathes your either cheek discloses
where he doth steep himself in milk and roses
and lastly by your lips the bank of kisses
where men at once may plant and gather blisses
tell me my lovd friend do you love or no
so well as i may tell in verse tis so
you blush but do not friends are either none
though they may number bodies or but one
ill therefore ask no more but bid you love
and so that either may example prove
unto the other and live patterns how
others in time may love as we do now
slip no occasion as time stands not still
i know no beauty nor no youth that will
to use the present then is not abuse
you have a husband is the just excuse
of all that can be done him such a one
as would make shift to make himself alone
that which we can who both in you his wife
his issue and all circumstance of life
as in his place because he would not vary
is constant to be extraordinary


a womans friendship god whom i trust in
forgive me this one foolish deadly sin
amongst my many other that i may
no more i am sorry for so fond cause say
at fifty years almost to value it
that neer was known to last above a fit
or have the least of good but what it must
put on for fashion and take up on trust
knew i all this afore had i perceivd
that their whole life was wickedness though weavd


of many colours outward fresh from spots
but their whole inside full of ends and knots
knew i that all their dialogues and discourse
were such as i will now relate or worse


knew i this woman yes and you do see
how penitent i am or i should be
do not you ask to know her she is worse
than all ingredients made into one curse
and that pourd out upon mankind can be
think but the sin of all her sex tis she
i could forgive her being proud a whore
perjurd and painted if she were no more
but she is such as she might yet forestall
the devil and be the damning of us all


ask not to know this man if fame should speak
his name in any metal it would break
two letters were enough the plague to tear
out of his grave and poyson every ear
a parcel of courtdirt a heap and mass
of all vice hurld together there he was
proud false and treacherous vindictive all
that thought can add unthankful the laystall
of putrid flesh alive of blood the sink
and so i leave to stir him lest he stink


though beauty be the mark of praise
and yours of whom i sing be such
as not the world can praise too much
yet ist your vertue now i raise


a vertue like allay so gone
throughout your form as though that move
and draw and conquer all mens love
this subjects you to love of one


wherein you triumph yet because
tis of your self and that you use
the noblest freedom not to choose
against or faith or honours laws


but who should less expect from you
in whom alone love lives agen
by whom he is restord to men
and kept and bred and brought up true


his falling temples you have reard
the withered garlands tane away
his altars kept from the decay
that envy wishd and nature feard


and on them burn so chaste a flame
with so much loyalties expence
as love t aquit such excellence
is gone himself into your name


and you are he the deity
to whom all lovers are designd
that would their better objects find
among which faithful troop am i


who as an offspring at your shrine
have sung this hymn and here intreat
one spark of your diviner heat
to light upon a love of mine


which if it kindle not but scant
appear and that to shortest view
yet give me leave t adore in you
what i in her am grievd to want


where dost thou careless lie
buried in ease and sloth
knowledge that sleeps doth die
and this security
it is the common moath
that eats on wits and arts and destroys them both


are all th aonian springs
drid up lies thespia waste
doth clarius harp want strings
that not a nymph now sings
or droop they as disgract
to see their seats and bowers by chattring pies defact


if hence thy silence be
as tis too just a cause
let this thought quicken thee
minds that are great and free
should not on fortune pause
tis crown enough to vertue still her own applause


what though the greedy fry
be taken with false baits
of worded balladry
and think it poesie
they die with their conceits
and only pitious scorn upon their folly waits


then take in hand thy lyre
strike in thy proper strain
with japhets line aspire
sols chariot for new fire
to give the world again
who aided him will thee the issue of joves brain


and since our dainty age
cannot indure reproof
make not thy self a page
to that strumpet the stage
but sing high and aloof
safe from the wolves black jaw and the dull asses hoof


from death and dark oblivion neer the same
the mistriss of mans life grave history
raising the world to good and evil fame
doth vindicate it to eternity


wise providence would so that nor the good
might be defrauded nor the great securd
but both might know their ways were understood
when vice alike in time with vertue durd


which makes that lighted by the beamy hand
of truth that searcheth the most springs
and guided by experience whose strait wand
doth meet whose line doth sound the depth of things


she chearfully supporteth what she rears
assisted by no strengths but are kerher own
some note of which each varied pillar bears
by which as proper titles she is known
times witness herald of antiquity
the light of truth and life of memory


where art thou genius i should use
thy present aid arise invention
wake and put on the wings of pindars muse
to towre with my intention
high as his mind that doth advance
her upright head above the reach of chance
or the times envy
cynthius i apply
my bolder numbers to thy golden lyre
o then inspire
thy priest in this strange rapture heat my brain
with delphick fire
that i may sing my thoughts in some unvulgar strain


rich beam of honour shed your light
on these dark rhymes that my affection
may shine through every chinck to every sight
graced by your reflection
then shall my verses like strong charms
break the knit circle of her stony arms
that hold your spirit
and keeps your merit
lockt in her cold embraces from the view
of eyes more true
who would with judgment search searching conclude
as provd in you
true nobless palm grows strait though handled neer so rude


nor think your self unfortunate
if subject to the jealous errrors
of politick pretext that wries a state
sink not beneath these terrors
but whisper o glad innocence
where only a mans birth is his offence
or the disfavour
of such a savour
nothing but practise upon honours thrall
o vertues fall
when her dead essence like the anatomy
in surgeons hall
is but a statists theam to read phlebotomy


let brontes and black steropes
sweat at the forge their hammers beating
pyracmons hour will come to give them ease
though but while metals heating
and after all the tnean ire
gold that is perfect will outlive the fire
for fury wasteth
as patience lasteth
no armour to the mind he is shotfree
from injury
that is not hurt not he that is not hit
so fools we see
oft scape an imputation more through luck than wit


but to your self most loyal lord
whose heart in that bright sphere flames clearest
though many gems be in your bosom stord
unknown which is the dearest


if i auspiciously divine
as my hope tells that our fair phbs shine
shall light those places
with lustrous graces
where darkness with her gloomy sceptred hand
doth now command
o then my bestbest lovd let me importune
that you will stand
as far from all revolt as you are now from fortune


high spirited friend
i send nor balms nor corsives to your wound
your fate hath found
a gentler and more agile hand to tend
the cure of that which is but corporal
and doubtful days which were namd critical
have made their fairest flight
and now are out of sight
yet doth some wholsome physick for the mind
wrapt in this paper lie
which in the taking if you misapply
you are unkind


your covetous hand
happy in that fair honour it hath gaind
must now be raind
true valour doth her own renown command
in one full action nor have you now more
to do than be a husband of that store
think but how dear you bought
this same which you have caught
such thoughts will make you more in love with truth
tis wisdom and that high
for men to use their fortune reverently
even in youth


hellen did homer never see
thy beauties yet could write of thee
did sappho on her seventongud lute
so speak as yet it is not mute
of phaos form or doth the boy
in whom anacreon once did joy
lie drawn to life in his soft verse
as he whom maro did rehearse
was lesbia sung by learnd catullus
or delias graces by tibullus
doth cynthia in propertius song
shine more than she the stars among
is horace his each love so high
rapt from the earth as not to die
with bright lycoris gallus choice
whose fame hath an eternal voice
or hath corynna by the name
her ovid gave her dimnd the fame
of csars daughter and the line
which all the world then stild divine
hath petrarch since his laura raisd
equal with her or ronsart praisd
his new cassandra bove the old
which all the fate of troy foretold
hath our great sydney stella set
where never star shone brighter yet
or constables ambrosiack muse
made dian not his notes refuse
have all these done and yet i miss
the swan that so relishd pancharis
and shall not i my celia bring
where men may see whom i do sing


though i in working of my song
come short of all this learned throng
yet sure my tunes will be the best
so much my subject drowns the rest


that have been a lover and could shew it
though not in these in rhymes not wholly dumb
since i exscribe your sonnets am become
a better lover and much better poet
nor is my muse or i ashamd to owe it
to those true numerous graces whereof some
but charm the senses others overcome
both brains and hearts and mine now best do know it
for in your verse all cupids armory
his flames his shafts his quiver and his bow
his very eyes are yours to overthrow
but then his mothers sweets you so apply
her joys her smiles her loves as readers take
for venus ceston every line you make


rhyme the rack of finest wits
that expresseth but by fits
true conceit
spoiling senses of their treasure
cosening judgment with a measure
but false weight
wresting words from their true calling
propping verse for fear of falling
to the ground
joynting syllables drowning letters
fastning vowels as with fetters
they were bound
soon as lazie thou wert known
all good poetry hence was flown
and are banishd
for a thousand years together
all pernassus green did wither
and wit vanishd
pegasus did fly away
at the wells no muse did stay
but bewaild
so to see the fountain dry
and apollos musick die
all light failed
starveling rhymes did fill the stage
not a poet in an age
worth crowning
not a work deserving bays
nor a line deserving praise
pallas frowning
greek was free from rhymes infection
happy greek by this protection
was not spoiled
whilst the latin queen of tongues
is not yet free from rhymes wrongs
but rests foiled
scarce the hill again doth flourish
scarce the world a wit doth nourish
to restore
phbus to his crown again
and the muses to their brain
as before


vulgar languages that want
words and sweetness and be scant
of true measure
tyran rhyme hath so abused
that they long since have refused
other ceasure
he that first invented thee
may his joynts tormented be
crampd for ever
still may syllables jar with time
still may reason war with rhyme
resting never
may his sense when it would meet
the cold tumor in his feet
grow unsounder
and his title be long fool
that in rearing such a school
was the founder


if thou wouldst know the vertues of mankind
read here in one what thou in all canst find
and go no farther let this circle be
thy universe though his epitome
cecil the grave the wise the great the good
what is there more that can ennoble blood
the orphans pillar the true subjects shield
the poors full storehouse and just servants field
the only faithful watchman for the realm
that in all tempests never quit the helm
but stood unshaken in his deeds and name
and labourd in the work not with the fame
that still was good for goodness sake nor thought
upon reward till the reward him sought
whose offices and honours did surprize
rather than meet him and before his eyes
closd to their peace he saw his branches shoot
and in the noblest families took root
of all the land who now at such a rate
of divine blessing would not serve a state


so justest lord may all your judgments be
laws and no change eer come to one decree
so may the king proclaim your conscience is
law to his law and think your enemies his
so from all sickness may you rise to health
the care and wish still of the publick wealth
so may the gentler muses and good fame
still fly about the odour of your name
as with the safety and honour of the laws
you favour truth and me in this mans cause


the judge his favour timely then extends
when a good cause is destitute of friends
without the pomp of counsel or more aid
than to make falshood blush and fraud afraid
when those good few that her defenders be
are there for charity and not for fee
such shall you hear to day and find great foes
both armd with wealth and slander to oppose
who thus long safe would gain upon the times
a right by the prosperity of their crimes
who though their guilt and perjury they know
think yea and boast that they have done it so
as though the court pursues them on the scent
they will come ofoff and scape the punishment
when this appears just lord to your sharp sight
he dos you wrong that craves you to do right


that i hereafter do not think the bar
the seat made of a more than civil war
or the great hall at westminster the field
where mutual frauds are fought and no side yield
that henceforth i believe nor books nor men
who gainst the law weave calumnies my benn
but when i read or hear the names so rife
of hirelings wranglers stitchersto of strife
hookhanded harpies gowned vultures put
upon the reverend pleaders do now shut
all mouthes that dare entitle them from hence
to the wolves study or dogs eloquence
thou art my cause whose manners since i knew
have made me to conceive a lawyer new
so dost thou study matter men and times
makst it religion to grow rich by crimes
darst not abuse thy wisdom in the laws
or skill to carry out an evil cause
but first doth vex and search it if nor sound
thou provst the gentler ways to cleanse the wound
and make the scar fair if that will not be
thou hast the brave scorn to put back the fee
but in a business that will bide the touch
what use what strength of reason and how much
of books of precedents hast thou at hand
as if the general store thou didst command
of argument still drawing forth the best
and not being borrowed by thee but possest
so comst thou like a chief into the court
armd at all pieces as to keep a fort
against a multitude and with thy stile
so brightly brandishd woundst defendst the while
thy adversaries fall as not a word
they had but were a reed unto thy sword
then comst thou off with victory and palm
thy hearers nectar and thy clients balm
the courts just honour and thy judges love
and which doth all atchievements get above
thy sincere practise breeds not thee a fame
alone but all thy rank a reverend name


envious and foul disease could there not be
one beauty in an age and free from thee
what did she worth thy spight were there not store
of those that set by their false faces more


than this did by her true she never sought
quarrel with nature or in balance brought
art her false servant nor for sir hugh plot
was drawn to practise other hue than that
her own blood gave her she neer had nor hath
any belief in madam baudbees bath
or turners oil of talk nor ever got
spanish receipt to make her teeth to rot
what was the cause then thoughtst thou in disgrace
of beauty so to nullifie a face
that heaven should make no more or should amiss
make all hereafter hadst thou ruind this
i that thy aim was but her fate prevaild
and scornd thouast shown thy malice but hast faild


what beauty would have lovely stild
what manners pretty nature mild
what wonder perfect all were filld
upon record in this blest child
and till the coming of the soul
to fetch the flesh we keep the roll


come let us here enjoy the shade
for love in shadow best is made
though envy oft his shadow be
none brooks the sunlight worse than he


where love doth shine there needs no sun
all lights into his one doth run
without which all the world were dark
yet he himself is but a spark


a spark to set whole world afire
who more they burn they more desire
and have their being their waste to see
and waste still that they still might be


such are his powers whom time hath stild
now swift now slow now tame now wild
now hot now cold now fierce now mild
the eldest god yet still a child


sir i am thankful first to heaven for you
next to your self for making your love true
then to your love and gift and alls but due


you have unto my store added a book
on which with profit i shall never look
but must confess from whom what gift i took


not like your country neighbours that commit
their vice of loving for a christmas fit
which is indeed but friendship of the spit


but as a friend which name your self receive
and which you being the worthier gave me leave
in letters that mix spirits thus to weave


which how most sacred i will ever keep
so may the fruitful vine my temples steep
and fame wake for me when i yield to sleep


though you sometimes proclaim me too severe
rigid and harsh which is a drug austere
in friendship i confess but dear friend hear


little know they that profess amity
and seek to scant her comely liberty
how much they lame her in her property


and less they know who being free to use
that friendship which no chance but love did choose
will unto license that fair leave abuse


it is an act of tyranny not love
in practisd friendship wholly to reprove
as flattry with friends humours still to move


from each of which i labour to be free
yet if with eithers vice i tainted be
forgive it as my frailty and not me


for no man lives so out of passions sway
but shall sometimes be tempted to obey
her fury yet no friendship to betray


tis true iam broke vows and all i had
of credit lost and i am now run mad
or do upon my self some desperate ill
this sadness makes no approaches but to kill
it is a darkness hath blockt up my sense
and drives it in to eat on my offence
or there to starve it help o you that may
alone lend succours and this fury stay
offended mistris you are yet so fair
as light breaks from you that affrights despair
and fills my powers with perswading joy
that you should be too noble to destroy
there may some face or menace of a storm
look forth but cannot last in such a form
if there be nothing worthy you can see
of graces or your mercy here in me
spare your own goodness yet and be not great
in will and power only to defeat
god and the good know to forgive and save
the ignorant and fools no pity have
i will not stand to justifie my fault
or lay the excuse upon the vinters vault
or in confessing of the crime be nice
or go about to countenance the vice
by naming in what company twas in
as i would urge authority for sin
no i will stand arraignd and cast to be
the subject of your grace in pardoning me
and stild your mercies creature will live more
your honour now than your disgrace before
think it was frailty mistris think me man
think that your self like heaven forgive me can
where weakness doth offend and vertue grieve
there greatness takes a glory to relieve
think that i once was yours or may be now
nothing is vile that is a part of you
errour and folly in me may have crost
your just commands yet those not i be lost
i am regenerate now become the child
of your compassion parents should be mild
there is no father that for one demerit
or two or three a son will disinherit
that is the last of punishments is meant
no man inflicts that pain till hope be spent
an illaffected limb what eer it ail
we cut not off till all cures else do fail


and then with pause for severd once thats gone
would live his glory that could keep it on
do not despair my mending to distrust
before you prove a medcine is unjust
you may so place me and in such an air
as not alone the cure but scar be fair
that is if still your favours you apply
and not the bounties you have done deny
could you demand the gifts you gave again
why wast did eer the clouds ask back their rain
the sun his heat and light the air his dew
or winds the spirit by which the flower so grew
that were to wither all and make a grave
of that wise nature would a cradle have
her order is to cherish and preserve
consumptions nature to destroy and starve
but to exact again what once is given
is natures meer obliquity as heaven
should ask the blood and spirits he hath infusd
in man because man hath the flesh abusd
o may your wisdom take example hence
god lightens not at mans each frail offence
he pardons slips goes by a world of ills
and then his thunder frights more than it kills
he cannot angry be but all must quake
it shakes even him that all things else doth shake
and how more fair and lovely looks the world
in a calm sky than when the heaven is hurld
about in clouds and wrapt in raging weather
as all with storm and tempest ran together
o imitate that sweet serenity
that makes us live not that which calls to die
in dark and sullen morns do we not say
this looketh like an execution day
and with the vulgar doth it not obtain
the name of cruel weather storm and rain
be not affected with these marks too much
of cruelty lest they do make you such
but view the mildness of your makers state
as i the penitents here emulate
he when he sees a sorrow such as this
streight puts off all his anger and doth kiss
the contrite soul who hath no thought to win
upon the hope to have another sin
forgiven him and in that line stand i
rather than once displease you more to die
to suffer tortures scorn and infamy
what fools and all their parasites can apply
the wit of ale and genius of the malt
can pump for or a libel without salt
produce though threatning with a coal or chalk
on every wall and sung whereeer i walk
i number these as being of the chore
of contumely and urge a good man more
than sword or fire or what is of the race
to carry noble danger in the face
there is not any punishment or pain
a man should fly from as he would disdain
then masters here here let your rigour end
and let your mercy make me ashamd t offend
i will no more abuse my vows to you
than i will study falshood to be true
o that you could but by dissection see
how much you are the better part of me
how all my fibres by your spirit do move
and that there is no life in me but love
you would be then most confident that tho
publick affairs command me now to go
out of your eyes and be a while away
absence or distance shall not breed decay
your form shines here here fixed in my heart
i may dilate my self but not depart
others by common stars their courses run
when i see you then i do see my sun


till then tis all but darkness that i have
rather than want your light i wish a grave


to make the doubt clear that no womans true
was it my fate to prove it full in you
thought i but one had breathd the purer air
and must she needs be false because shes fair
it is your beauties mark or of your youth
or your perfection not to study truth
or think you heaven is deaf or hath no eyes
or those it has wink at your perjuries
are vows so cheap with women or the matter
whereof they are made that they are writ in water
and blown away with wind or doth their breath
both hot and cold at once threat life and death
who could have thought so many accents sweet
tund to our words so many sighs should meet
blown from our hearts so many oaths and tears
sprinkled among all sweeter by our fears
and the divine impression of stoln kisses
that seald the rest could now prove empty blisses
did you draw bonds to forfeit sign to break
or must we read you quite from what you speak
and find the truth out the wrong way or must
he first desire you false would wish you just
o i profane though most of women be
the common monster love shall except thee
my dearest love however jealousie
with circumstance might urge the contrary
sooner ill think the sun would cease to chear
the teeming earth and that forget to bear
sooner that rivers would run back or thames
with ribs of ice in june would bind his streams
or nature by whose strength the world endures
would change her course before you alter yours
but o that treacherous breast to whom weak you
did trust our counsels and we both may rue
having his falshood found too late twas he
that made me cast you guilty and you me
whilst he black wretch betrayd each simple vvord
vve spake unto the coming of a third
curst may he be that so our love hath slain
and wander wretched on the earth as cain
vvretched as he and not deserve least pity
in plaguing him let misery be witty
let all eyes shun him and he shun each eye
till he be noisom as his infamy
may he without remorse deny god thrice
and not be trusted more on his souls price
and after all selftorment when he dies
may wolves tear out his heart vultures his eyes
swine eat his bowels and his falser tongue
that utterd all be to some raven flung
and let his carrion coarse be a longer feast
to the kings dogs than any other beast
now i have curst let us our love receive
in me the flame was never more alive
i could begin again to court and praise
and in that pleasure lengthen the short days
of my lifes lease like painters that do take
delight not in made works but whilst they make
i could renew those times when first i saw
love in your eyes that gave my tongue the law
to like what you likd and at masques or plays
commend the selfsame actors the same ways
ask how you did and often with intent
of being officious grow impertinent
all which were such lost pastimes as in these
love was as subtly catchd as a disease
but being got it is a treasure sweet
which to defend is harder than to get


and ought not be profand on either part
for though tis got by chance tis kept by art


that loves a bittersweet i neer conceive
till the sowr minute comes of taking leave
and then i taste it but as men drink up
in haste the bottom of a medcind cup
and take some sirrup after so do i
to put all rellish from my memory
of parting drown it in the hope to meet
shortly again and make our absence sweet
this makes me mistris that sometimes by stealth
under another name i take your health
and turn the ceremonies of those nights
i give or owe my friends into your rites
but ever without blazon or least shade
of vows so sacred and in silence made
for though love thrive and may grow up with chear
and free society hes born elsewhere
and must be bred so to conceal his birth
as neither wine do rack it out or mirth
yet should the lover still be airy and light
in all his actions rarified to sprite
not like a midas shut up in himself
and turning all he toucheth into pelf
keep in reservd in his darklantern face
as if that exclent dulness were loves grace
no masters no the open merry man
moves like a spritely river and yet can
keep secret in his channels what he breeds
bove all your standing waters choakd with weeds
they look at best like creambowls and you soon
shall find their depth theyre sounded with a spoon
they may say grace and for loves chaplains pass
but the grave lover ever was an ass
is fixd upon one leg and dares not come
out with the other for hes still at home
like the dull wearied crane that come on land
doth while he keeps his watch betray his stand
where he that knows will like a lapwing fly
far from the nest and so himself belie
to others as he will deserve the trust
due to that one that doth believe him just
and such your servant is who vows to keep
the jewel of your name as close as sleep
can lock the sense up or the heart a thought
and never be by time or folly brought
weakness of brain or any charm of wine
the sin of boast or other countermine
made to blow up loves secrets to discover
that article may not become our lover
which in assurance to your breast i tell
if i had writ no word but dear farewel


since you must go and i must bid farewell
hear mistress your departing servant tell
what it is like and do not think they can
be idle words though of a parting man
it is as if a night should shade noonday
or that the sun was here but forct away
and we were left under that hemisphere
where we must feel it dark for half a year
what fate is this to change mens days and hours
to shift their seasons and destroy their powers
alas i ha lost my heat my blood my prime
winter is come a quarter eer his time
my health will leave me and when you depart
how shall i do sweet mistris for my heart


you would restore it no thats worth a fear
as if it were not worthy to be there
o keep it still for it had rather be
your sacrifice than here remain with me
and so i spare it come what can become
of me ill softly tread unto my tomb
or like a ghost walk silent amongst men
till i may see both it and you agen


let me be what i am as virgil cold
as horace fat or as anacreon old
no poets verses yet did ever move
whose readers did not think he was in love
who shall forbid me then in rhyme to be
as light and active as the youngest he
that from the muses fountains doth indorse
his lines and hourly sits the poets horse
put on my ivy garland let me see
who frowns who jealous is who taxeth me
fathers and husbands i do claim a right
in all that is calld lovely take my sight
sooner than my affection from the fair
no face no hand proportion line or air
of beauty but the muse hath interest in
there is not worn that lace purl knot or pin
but is the poets matter and he must
when he is furious love although not lust
but then content your daughters and your wives
if they be fair and worth it have their lives
made longer by our praises or if not
wish you had foul ones and deformed got
curst in their cradles or there changd by elves
so to be sure you do enjoy your selves
yet keep those up in sackcloth too or leather
for silk will draw some sneaking songster thither
it is a rhyming age and verses swarm
at every stall the city caps a charm
but i who live and have livd twenty year
where i may handle silk as free and near
as any mercer or the whaleboneman
that quilts those bodies i have leave to span
have eaten with the beauties and the wits
and braveries of court and felt their fits
of love and hate and came so nigh to know
whether their faces were their own or no
it is not likely i should now look down
upon a velvet petticoat or a gown
whose like i have known the taylors wife put on
to do her husbands rites in eer twere gone
home to the customer his letchery
being the best clothes still to preoccupy
put a coachmare in tissue must i horse
her presently or leap thy wife of force
when by thy sordid bounty she hath on
a gown of that was the caparison
so i might dote upon thy chairs and stools
that are like clothd must i be of those fools
of race accounted that no passion have
but when thy wife as thou conceivst is brave
then ope thy wardrobe think me that poor groom
that from the footman when he was become
an officer there did make most solemn love
to evry petticoat he brushd and glove
he did lay up and would adore the shooe
or slipper was left off and kiss it too
court every hanging gown and after that
lift up some one and do i tell not what
thou didst tell me and wert oerjoyd to peep
in at a hole and see these actions creep
from the poor wretch which though he plaid in prose
he would have done in verse with any one of those


wrung on the withers by lord loves despight
had he had the faculty to read and write
such songsters there are store of witness he
that chancd the lace laid on a smock to see
and streightway spent a sonnet with that other
that in pure madrigal unto his mother
commended the frenchhood and scarlet gown
the lady mayress passd in through the town
unto the spittle sermon o what strange
variety of silks were on th exchange
or in moorefields this other night sings one
another answers lass those silks are none
in smiling lenvoye as he woud deride
any comparison had with his cheapside
and vouches both the pageant and the day
when not the shops but windows do display
the stuffs the velvets plushes fringes lace
and all the original riots of the place
let the poor fools enjoy their follies love
a goat in velvet or some block could move
under that cover an old midwives hat
or a closestool so casd or any fat
bawd in a velvet scabberd i envy
none of their pleasures nor will ask thee why
thou art jealous of thy wives or daughters case
more than of eithers manners wit or face


and why to me this thou lame lord of fire
what had i done that might call on thine ire
or urge thy greedy flame thus to devour
so many my yearslabours in an hour
i nere attempted vulcan gainst thy life
nor made least line of love to thy loose wife
or in remembrance of thy afront and scorn
with clowns and tradesmen kept thee closd in horn
twas jupiter that hurld thee headlong down
and mars that gave thee a lanthorn for a crown
was it because thou wert of old denied
by jove to have minerva for thy bride
that since thou takst all envious care and pain
to ruine any issue of the brain
had i wrote treason there or heresie
imposture whitchcraft charms or blasphemy
i had deservd then thy consuming looks
perhaps to have been burned with my books
but on thy malice tell me didst thou spy
any least loose or surrilescurrile paper lye
conceald or kept there that was fit to be
by thy own vote a sacrifice to thee
did i there wound the honours of the crown
or tax the glories of the church and gown
itch to defame the state or brand the times
and my self most in some selfboasting rhymes
if none of these then why this fire or find
a cause before or leave me one behind
had i compild from amadis de gaule

and so some goodlier monster had begot
or spun out riddles and weavd fittyfifty tomes
of logogriphes and curious palindromes
or pompd for those hard trifles anagrams
or eteostichs or those finer flams
of eggs and halberds cradles and a hearse
a pair of scisars and a comb in verse
acrostichs and telestichs on jump names
thou then hadst had some colour for thy flames
on such my serious follies but thoult say
there were some pieces of as base allay
and as false stamp there parcels of a play
fitter to see the firelight than the day


adulterate moneys such as might not go
thou shouldst have stayd till publick fame said so
she is the judge thou executioner
or if thou needs wouldst trench upon her power
thou mightst have yet enjoyd thy cruelty
with some more thrift and more variety
thou mightst have had me perish piece by piece
to light tobacco or save roasted geese
sindge capons or poor piggs droping their eyes
condemnd me to the ovens with the pies
and so have kept me dying a whole age
not ravishd all hence in a minutes rage
but thats a mark whereof thy rights do boast
to make consumption ever where thou gost
had i foreknown of this thy least desire
t have held a triumph or a feast of fire
especially in paper that that steam
had tickled your large nostril many a ream
to redeem mine i had sent in enough
though shouldst have cryd and all been proper stuff
the talmud and the alcoran had come
with pieces of the legend the whole sum
of errant knighthood with the dames and dwarfs
the charmed boats and the inchanted wharfs
the tristrams lanclots turpins and the peers
all the mad rolands and sweet oliveers
to merlins marvails and his caballs loss
with the chimra of the rosiecross
their seals their characters hermetick rings
their jem of riches and bright stone that brings
invisibility and strength and tongues
the art of kindling the true coal by lungs
with nicholas pasquills medle with your match
and the strong lines that so the time do catch
or captain pamphlets horse and foot that sally
upon th exchange still out of popesheadalley
the weekly corrants with poules seal and all
the admird discourses of the prophet ball
these hadst thou pleasd either to dine or sup
had made a meal for vulcan to lick up
but in my desk what was there to accite
so ravenous and vast an appetite
i dare not say a body but some parts
there were of search and mastry in the arts
all the old venusine in poetry
and lighted by the stagerite could spy
was there madmade english with the grammar too
to teach some that their nurses could not omitted do
the purity of language and among
the rest my journey into scotland song
with all th adventures three books not afraid
to speak the fate of the sicilian maid
to our own ladies and in story there
of our fifth henry eight of his nine year
wherein was oil beside the succour spent
which noble carew cotton selden lent
and twicetwelveyears stord up humanity
with humble gleanings in divinity
after the fathers and those wiser guides
whom faction had not drawn to study sides
how in these ruins vulcan thou dost lurk
all soot and embers odious as thy work
i now begin to doubt if ever grace
or goddess could be patient of thy face
thou woo minerva or to wit aspire
cause thou canst halt with us in arts and fire
son of the wind for so thy mother gone
with lust conceivd thee father thou hadst none
when thou wert born and that thou lookst at best
she durst not kiss but flung thee from her breast
and so did jove who nere meant thee his cup
no marl the clowns of lemnos took thee up
for none but smiths would have made thee a god
some alchimist there may be yet or odd


squire of the squibs against the pageant day
may to thy name a vulcanale say
and for it lose his eyes with gunpowder
as th other may his brains with quicksilver
wellfare the wiseman yet on the banckside
my friends the watermen they could provide
against thy fury when to serve their needs
they made a vulcan of a sheaf of reeds
whom they durst handle in their holyday coats
and safely trust to dress not burn their boats
but o those reeds thy meer disdain of them
made thee beget that cruel stratagem
which some are pleasd to stile but thy mad pranck
against the globe the glory of the bank
which though it were the fort of the whole parish
flanckd with a ditch and forcd out of a marish
i saw with two poor chambers taken in
and razd ere thought could urge this might have been
see the worlds ruines nothing but the piles
left and wit since to cover it with tiles
the brethren they streight noisd it out for news
twas verily some relick of the stews
and this a sparkle of that fire let loose
that was lockd up in the winchestrian goose
bred on the banck in time of popery
when venus there maintaind in mystery
but others fell with that conceit by the ears
and cryd it was a threatning to the bears
and that accursed ground the parish garden
nay sighd ah sister twas the nun kate arden
kindled the fire but then did one return
no fool would his own harvest spoil or burn
if that were so thou rather wouldst advance
the place that was thy wives inheritance
o no cryd all fortune for being a whore
scapd not his justice and jot the more
he burnt that idol of the revels too
nay let whitehall with revels have to do
though but in dances it shall know his power
there was a judgment shewn too in an hour
he is true vulcan still he did not spare
troy though it were so much his venus care
fool wilt thou let that in example come
did not she save from thence to build a rome
and what hast thou done in these petty spights
more then advancd the houses and their rights
i will not argue thee from those of guilt
for they were burnt but to be better built
tis true that in thy wish they were destroyd
which thou hast only vented not enjoyd
so wouldst th have run upon the rolls by stealth
and didst invade part of the commonwealth
in those records which were all chronicles gone
will be remembred by six clerks to one
but say all six good men what answer ye
lyes there no writ out of the chancery
against this vulcan no injunction
no order no decree though we be gone
at commonlaw methinks in his despight
a court of equity should do us right
but to confine him to the brewhouses
the glasshouse dyefats and their furnaces
to live in seacoal and go forth in smoke
or lest that vapour might the city choak
condemn him to the brickkills or some hill
foot out in sussex to an iron mill
or in small fagots have him blaze about
vile taverns and the drunkards piss him out
or in the bellmans lanthorn like a spy
burn to a snuff and then stink out and dye
i could invent a sentence yet were worse
but ill conclude all in a civil curse
pox on your flameship vulcan if it be
to all as fatal ast hath been to me


and to paulssteeple which was unto us
bove all your fireworks had at ephesus
or alexandria and though a divine
loss remains yet as unrepaird as mine
would you had kept your forge at tna still
and there made swords bills glaves and arms your fill
maintaind the trade at bilbo or elsewhere
struck in at millan with the cutlers there
or stayd but where the fryar and you first met
who from the divelsarse did guns beget
or fixt in the lowcountrys where you might
on both sides do your mischiefs with delight
blow up and ruine mine and countermine
make your petards and granats all your fine
engines of murder and receive the praise
of massacring mankind so many ways
we ask your absence here we all love peace
and pray the fruits thereof and the increase
so doth the king and most of the kingsmen
that have good places therefore once agen
pox on thee vulcan thy pandoras pox
and all the evils that flew out of her box
light on thee or if those plagues will not do
thy wives pox on thee and bess broughtons too


why yet my noble hearts they cannot say
but we have powder still for the kings day
and ordnance too so much as from the tower
t have wakd if sleeping spains ambassadour
old sope gundomar the french can tell
for they did see it the last tilting well
that we have trumpets armour and great horse
launces and men and some a breaking force
they saw too store of feathers and more may
if they stay here but till saint georges day
all ensigns of a war are not yet dead
nor marks of wealth so from our nation fled
but they may see goldchains and pearl worn then
lent by the london dames to the lords men
withal the dirty pains those citizens take
to see the pride at court their wives do make
and the return those thankful courtiers yield
to have their husbands drawn forth to the field
and coming home to tell what acts were done
under the auspice of young swynnerton
what a strong fort old pimblicoe had been
how it held out how last twas taken in
well i say thrive thrive brave artilleryyard
thou seedplot of the war that hast not spard
powder or paper to bring up the youth
of lonndon in the military truth
these ten years day as all may swear that look
but on thy practise and the posturebook
he that but saw thy curious captains drill
would think no more of vlushingflushing or the brill
but give them over to the common ear
for that unnecessary charge they were
well did thy crafty clerk and knight sir hugh
supplant bold panton and brought there to view
translated lian tacticks to be read
and the greek discipline with the modern shed
so in that ground as soon it grew to be
the cityquestion whether tilly or he
were now the greater captain for they saw
the berghen siege and taking in breda
so acted to the life as maurice might
and spinola have blushed at the sight
o happy art and wise epitome
of bearing arms most civil soldiery
thou canst draw forth thy forces and fight dry
the battels of thy aldermanity


without the hazard of a drop of blood
more then the surfets in thee that day stood
go on increast in vertue and in fame
and keep the glory of the english name
up among nations in the stead of bold
beauchamps and nevills cliffords audleys old


insert thy hodges and those newer men
as stiles dike ditchfield millar crips and fen
that keep the war though nowt be grown more tame
alive yet in the noise and still the same
and could if our great men would let their sons
come to their schools show em the use of guns
and there instruct the noble english heirs
in politick and militar affairs
but he that should perswade to have this done
for education of our lordings soon
should he hear of billow wind and storm
from the tempestuous grandlings wholl inform
us in our bearing that are thus and thus
born bred allied whats he dare tutor us
are we by bookworms to be awd must we
live by their scale that dare do nothing free
why are we rich or great except to show
all licence in our lives what need we know
more then to praise a dog or horse or speak
the hawking language or our day to break
with citizens let clowns and tradesmen breed
their sons to study arts the laws the creed
we will believe like men of our own rank
in so much land a year or such a bank
that turns us so much monies at which rate
our ancestors imposd on prince and state
let poor nobility be vertuous we
descended in a rope of titles be
from guy or bevis arthur or from whom
the herald will our blood is now become
past any need of vertue let them care
that in the cradle of their gentry are
to serve the state by councels and by arms
we neither love the troubles nor the harms
what love you then your whore what study gate
carriage and dressing there is up of late
the academy where the gallants meet
what to make legs yes and to smell most sweet
all that they do at plays o but first here
they learn and study and then practise there
but why are all these irons i the fire
of several makings helps helps t attire
his lordship that is for his band his hair
this and that box his beauty to repair
this other for his eyebrows hence away
i may no longer on these pictures stay
these carkasses of honour taylors blocks
coverd with tissue whose prosperity mocks
the fate of things whilst totterd vertue holds
her broken arms up to their empty moulds


what i am not and what i fain would be
whilst i inform my self i would teach thee
my gentle arthur that it might be said
one lesson we have both learnd and well read
i neither am nor art thou one of those
that hearkens to a jackspulse when it goes
nor ever trusted to that friendship yet
was issue of the tavern or the spit
much less a name would we bring up or nurse
that could but claim a kindred from the purse
those are poor ties depend on those false ends
tis vertue alone or nothing that knits friends
and as within your office you do take
no piece of money but you know or make


inquiry of the worth so must we do
first weigh a friend then touch and try him too
for there are many slips and counterfeits
deceit is fruitful men have masks and nets
but these with wearing will themselves unfold
they cannot last no lye grew ever old
turn him and see his threds look if he be
friend to himself that would be friend to thee
for that is first requird a man be his own
but he thats too much that is friend of none
then rest and a friends value understand
it is a richer purchase then of land


he that should search all glories of the gown
and steps of all raisd servants of the crown
he could not find then thee of all that store
whom fortune aided less or vertue more
such coke were thy beginnings when thy good
in others evil best was understood
when being the srangers help the poor mans aid
thy just defences made th oppressor afraid
such was thy process when integrity
and skill in thee now grew authority
that clients strove in question of the laws
more for thy patronage then for their cause
and that thy strong and manly eloquence
stood up thy nations fame her crowns defence
and now such is thy stand while thou dost deal
desired justice to the publick weal
like solons self explatst the knotty laws
with endless labours whilst thy learning draws
no less of praise then readers in all kinds
of worthiest knowledge that can take mens minds
such is thy all that as i sung before
none fortune aided less or vertue more
or if chance must to each man that doth rise
needs lend an aid to thine she had her eyes


men that are safe and sure in all they do
care not what trials they are put unto
they meet the fire the test as martyrs would
and though opinion stamp them not are gold
i could say more of such but that i fly
to speak my self out too ambitiously
and shewing so weak an act to vulgar eyes
put conscience and my right to comprimise
let those that meerly talk and never think
that live in the wild anarchy of drink
subject to quarrel only or else such
as make it their proficiency how much
theyave glutted in and letcherd out that week
that never yet did friend or friendship seek
but for a sealing let these men protest
or thother on their borders that will jeast
on all souls that are absent even the dead
like flies or worms which mans corrupt parts fed
that to speak well think it above all sin
of any company but that they are in
call every night to supper in these fits
and are receivd for the covey of wits
that censure all the town and all th affairs
and know whose ignorance is more then theirs
let these men have their ways and take their times
to vent their libels and to issue rhymes
i have no portion in them nor their deal
of news they get to strew out the long meal


i study other friendships and more one
then these can ever be or else wish none
what ist to me whether the french design
be or be not to get the valltelline
or the states ships sent forth belike to meet
some hopes of spain in their westindian fleet
whether the dispensation yet be sent
or that the match from spain was ever meant
i wish all well and pray high heaven conspire
my princes safety and my kings desire
but if for honour we must draw the sword
and force back that which will not be restord
i have a body yet that spirit draws
to live or fall a carkass in the cause
so far without inquiry what the states
brunsfield and mansfield do this year my fates
shall carry me at call and ill be well
though i do neither hear these news nor tell
of spain or france or were not prickd down one
of the late mystery of reception
although my fame to his not underhears
that guides the motions and directs the bears
but thats a blow by which in time i may
lose all my credit with my christmas clay
and animated porclane of the court
i and for this neglect the courser sort
of earthen jars there may molest me too
well with mine own frail pitcher what to do
i have decreed keep it from waves and press
lest it be justled crackd made nought or less
live to that point i will for which i am man
and dwell as in my center as i can
still looking too and ever loving heaven
with reverence using all the gifts then given
mongst which if i have any friendships sent
such as are square welltagd and permanent
not built with canvass paper and false lights
as are the glorious scenes at the great sights
and that there be no fevry heats nor colds
oily expansions or shrunk dirty folds
but all so clear and led by reasons flame
as but to stumble in her sight were shame
these i will honour love embrace and serve
and free it from all question to preserve
so short you read my character and theirs
i would call mine to which not many stairs
are asked to climb first give me faith who know
my self a little i will take you so
as you have writ your self now stand and then
sir you are sealed of the tribe of ben


since bacchus thou art father
of wines to thee the rather
we dedicate this cellar
where new thou art made dweller
and seal thee thy commission
but tis with a condition
that thou remain here taster
of all to the great master
and look unto their faces
their qualities and races
that both their odour take him
and relish merry make him
for bacchus thou art freer
of cares and overseer
of feast and merry meeting
and still beginst the greting
see then thou dost attend him
lyus and defend him
by all the arts of gladness
from any thought like sadness


so mayst thou still be younger
than phbus and much stronger
to give mankind their eases
and cure the worlds diseases
so may the muses follow
thee still and leave apollo
and think thy stream more quicker
then hippocrenes liquor
and thou make many a poet
before his brain do know it
so may there never quarrel
have issue from the barrel
but venus and the graces
pursue thee in all places
and not a song be other
then cupid and his mother
that when king james above here
shall feast it thou maist love there
the causes and the guests too
and have thy tales and jests too
thy circuits and thy rounds free
as shall the feasts fair grounds be
be it he hold communion
in great saint georges union
or gratulates the passage
of some wellwrought embassage
whereby he may knit sure up
the wished peace of europe
or else a health advances
to put his court in dances
and set us all on skipping
when with his royal shipping
the narrow seas are shady
and charles brings home the lady


dos the courtpucell then so censure me
and thinks i dare not her let the world see
what though her chamber be the very pit
where fight the prime cocks of the game for wit
and that as any are stroke her breath creates
new in their stead out of the candidates
what though with tribade lust she force a muse
and in an epicne fury can write news
equal with that which for the best news goes
as airy light and as like wit as those
what though she talk and cannot once with them
make state religion bawdry all a theam
and as lipthirsty in each words expence
doth labour with the phrase more than the sense
what though she ride two mile on holydays
to church as others do to feasts and plays
to shew their tires to view and to be viewd
what though she be with velvet gowns indud
and spangled petticotes brought forth to eye
as new rewards of her old secresie
what though she hath won on trust as many do
and that her truster fears her must i too
i never stood for any place my wit
thinks it self nought though she should value it
i am no statesman and much less divine
for bawdry tis her language and not mine
farthest i am from the idolatry
to stuffs and laces those my man can buy
and trust her i would least that hath forswore
in contract twice what can she perjure more
indeed her dressing some man might delight
her face theres none can like by candlelight
not he that should the body have for case
to his poor instrument now out of grace


shall i advise thee pucell steal away
from court while yet thy fame hath some small day
the wits will leave you if they once perceive
you cling to lords and lords if them you leave
for sermoneers of which now one now other
they say you weekly invite with fits o th mother
and practise for a miracle take heed
this age would lend no faith to dorrels deed
or if it would the court is the worst place
both for the mothers and the babes of grace
for there the wicked in the chair of scorn
will callt a bastard when a prophets born


the wisdom madam of your private life
where with this while you live a widowed wife
and the right ways you take unto the right
to conquer rumour and triumph on spight
not only shunning by your act to do
ought that is ill but the suspicion too
is of so brave example as he were
no friend to vertue could be silent here
the rather when the vices of the time
are grown so fruitful and false pleasures climb
by all oblique degrees that killing height
from whence they fall cast down with their own weight
and though all praise bring nothing to your name
who herein studying conscience and not fame
are in your self rewarded yet twill be
a chearful work to all good eyes to see
among the daily ruins that fall foul
of state of fame of body and of soul
so great a vertue stand upright to view
as makes penelopes old fable true
whilst your ulisses hath tane leave to go
countries and climescomma omitted manners and men to know
only your time you better entertain
than the great homers wit for her could fain
for you admit no company but good
and when you want those friends or near in blood
or your allies you make your books your friends
and study them unto the noblest ends
searching for knowledge and to keep your mind
the same it was inspird rich and refind
these graces when the rest of ladies view
not boasted in your life but practisd true
as they are hard for them to make their own
so are they profitable to be known
for when they find so many meet in one
it will be shame for them if they have none


hail happy genius of this ancient pile
how comes it all things so about thee smile
the fire the wine the men and in the midst
thou standst as if some mystery thou didst
pardon i read it in thy face the day
for whose returns and many all these pray
and so do i this is the sixtieth year
since bacon and thy lord was born and here
son to the grave wise keeper of the seal
fame and foundation of the english weal
what then his father was that since is he
now with a title more to the degree
englands highchancellor the destind heir
in his soft cradle to his fathers chair
whose even thred the fates spin round and full
out of their choicest and their whitest wooll
tis a brave cause of joy let it be known
for twere a narrow gladness kept thine own
give me a deepcrowndbowl that i may sing
in raising him the wisdom of my king


to paint thy worth if rightly i did know it
and were but painter half like thee a poet
ben i would show it
but in this skill m unskilful pen will tire
thou and thy worth will still be found far higher
and i a lier
then what a painters here or what an eater
of great attempts when as his skils no greater
and he a cheater
then what a poets here whom by confession
of all with me to paint without digression
theres no expression


why though i seem of a prodigious wast
i am not so voluminous and vast
but there are lines wherewith i might b embracd


tis true as my womb swells so my back stoops
and the whole lump grows round deformd and droops
but yet the tun at heidelberg had hoops


you were not tied by any painters law
to square my circle i confess but draw
my superficies that was all you saw


which if in compass of no art it came
to be described by a monogram
with one great blot yo had formd me as i am


but whilst you curious were to have it be
an archetype for all the world to see
you made it a brave piece but not like me


o had i now your manner mastry might
your power of handling shadow air and spright
how i would draw and take hold and delight


but you are he can paint i can but write
a poet hath no more but black and white
ne knows he flattring colours or false light


yet when of friendship i would draw the face
a letterd mind and a large heart would place
to all posterity i will write burlase


when first my lord i saw you back your horse
provoke his metal and command his force
to all the uses of the field and race
me thought i read the ancient art of thrace
and saw a centaure past those tales of greece
so seemd your horse and you both of a piece
you shewd like perseus upon pegasus
or castor mounted on his cyllarus
or what we hear our homeborn legend tell
of bold sir bevis and his arundell
nay so your seat his beauties did endorse
as i began to wish my self a horse


wand surely had i but your stable seen
before i think my wish absolvd had been
for never saw i yet the muses dwell
nor any of their houshold half so well
so well as when i saw the floor and room
i lookd for hercules to be the groom
and crid away with the csarian bread
at these immortal mangers virgil fed


iam to dine friend where i must be weighd
for a just wager and that wager paid
if i do lose it and without a tale
a merchants wife is regent of the scale
who when she heard the match concluded streight
an ill commodity t must make good weight
so that upon the point my corporal fear
is she will play dame justice too severe
and hold me to it close to stand upright
within the balance and not want a mite
but rather with advantage to be found
full twenty stone of which i lack two pound
thats six in silver now within the socket
stinketh my credit if into the pocket
it do not come one piece i have in store
lend me dear arthur for a week five more
and you shall make me good in weight and fashion
and then to be returnd or protestation
to go out after till when take this letter
for your security i can no better


would god my burges i could think
thoughts worthy of thy gift this ink
then would i promise here to give
verse that should thee and me outlive
but since the wine hath steepd my brain
i only can the paper stain
yet with a dye that fears no moth
but scarletlike outlasts the cloth


you won not verses madam you won me
when you would play so nobly and so free
a book to a few lines but it was fit
you won them too your odds did merit it
so have you gaind a servant and a muse
the first of which i fear you will refuse
and you may justly being a tardy cold
unprofitable chattel fat and old
laden with belly and doth hardly approach
his friends but to break chairs or crack a coach
his weight is twenty stone within two pound
and thats made up as doth th purse abound
marry the muse is one can tread the air
and stroke the water nimble chast and fair
sleep in a virgins bosom without fear
run all the rounds in a soft ladies ear
widow or wife without the jealousie
of either suitor or a servant by
such if her manners like you i do send
and can for other graces her commend
to make you merry on the dressingstool
a mornings and at afternoons to fool
away ill company and help in rhyme
your joan to pass her melancholy time
by this although you fancy not the man
accept his muse and tell i know you can


how many verses madam are your due
i can lose none in tendring these to you
i gain in having leave to keep my day
and should grow rich had i much more to pay


father john burges
necessity urges
my woful cry
to sir robert pie
and that he will venter
to send my debenture
tell him his ben
knew the time when
he lovd the muses
though now he refuses
to take apprehension
of a years pension
and more is behind
put him in mind
christmas is near
and neither good chear
mirth fooling nor wit
nor any least fit
of gambol or sport
will come at the court
if there be no money
no plover or coney
will come to the table
or wine to enable
the muse or the poet
the parish will know it
nor any quickwarmingpan help him to bed
if the checker be empty so will be his head


thou friend wilt hear all censures unto thee
all mouths are open and all stomachs free
be thou my books intelligencer note
what each man says of it and of what coat
his judgment is if he be wise and praise
thank him if other he can give no bays
if his wit reach no higher but to spring
thy wife a fit of laughter a crampring
will be reward enough to wear like those
that hang their richest jewels i their nose
like a rung bear or swine grunting out wit
as if that part lay for a most fit
if they go on and that thou lovst alife
their perfumd judgments let them kiss thy wife


they talk of fencing and the use of arms
the art of urging and avoiding harms
the noble science and the mastring skill
of making just approaches how to kill
to hit in angels and to clash with time
as all defence or offence were a chime
i hate such measurd give me metalld fire
that trembles in the blaze but then mounts higher
a quick and dazling motion when a pair
of bodies meet like rarified air
their weapons shot out with that flame and force
as they outdid the lightning in the course
this were a spectacle a sight to draw
wonder to valour no it is the law


of daring not to do a wrong is true
valour to slight it being done to you
to know the heads of danger where tis fit
to bend to break provoke or suffer it
all this my lord is valour this is yours
and was your fathers all your ancestors
who durst live great mongst all the colds and heats
of humane life as all the frosts and sweats
of fortune when or death appeard or bands
and valiant were with or without their hands


if passenger thou canst but read
stay drop a tear for him thats dead
henry the brave young lord laware
minervas and the muses care
what could their care do gainst the spight
of a disease that lovd no light
of honour nor no air of good
but crept like darkness through his blood
offended with the dazling flame
of vertue got above his name
no noble furniture of parts
no love of action and high arts
no aim at glory or in war
ambition to become a star
could stop the malice of this ill
that spread his body oer to kill
and only his great soul envyd
because it durst have noblier dyd


that you have seen the pride beheld the sport
and all the games of fortune plaid at court
viewd there the market read the wretched rate
at which there are would sell the prince and state
that scarce you hear a publick voice alive
but whisperd counsels and those only thrive
yet are got off thence with clear mind and hands
to lift to heaven who ist not understands
your happiness and doth not speak you blest
to see you set apart thus from the rest
t obtain of god what all the land should ask
a nations sin got pardond twere a task
fit for a bishops knees o bow them oft
my lord till felt grief make our stonehearts soft
and we do weep to water for our sin
he that in such a flood as we are in
of riot and consumption knows the way
to teach the people how to fast and pray
and do their penance to avert gods rod
he is the man and favorite of god


great c h a r l e s among the holy gifts of grace
annexed to thy person and thy place
tis not enough thy piety is such
to cure the calld kings evil with thy touch
but thou wilt yet a kinglier mastry try
to cure the poets evil poverty


and in these cures dost so thy self enlarge
as thou dost cure our evil at thy charge
nay and in this thou showst to value more
one poet than of other folk ten score
o piety so to weigh the poors estates
o bounty so to difference the rates
what can the poet wish his king may do
but that he cure the peoples evil too


who dares deny that all firstfruits are due
to god denies the godhead to be true
who doubts those fruits god can with gain restore
doth by his doubt distrust his promise more
he can he will and with large intrest pay
what at his liking he will take away
then royal c h a r l e s and m a r y do not grutch
that the almightys will to you is such
but thank his greatness and his goodness too
and think all still the best that he will do
that thought shall make he will this loss supply
with a long large and blest posterity
for god whose essence is so infinite
cannot but heap that grace he will requite


how happy were the subject if he knew
most pious king but his own good in you
how many times live long charles would he say
if he but weighd the blessings of this day
and as it turns our joyful year about
for safety of such majesty cry out
indeed when had great britain greater cause
than now to love the soveraign and the laws
when you that reign are her example grown
and what are bounds to her you make your own
when yonryour u inverted assiduous practice doth secure
that faith which she professeth to be pure
when all your lifes a precedent of days
and murmur cannot quarrel at your ways
how is she barren grown of love or broke
that nothing can her gratitude provoke
o times o manners surfeit bred of ease
the truly epidemical disease
tis not alone the merchant but the clown
is bankrupt turnd the cassock cloak and gown
are lost upon accompt and none will know
how much to heaven for thee great c h a r l e s they owe


and art thou born brave babe blest be thy birth
that so hath crownd our hopes our spring and earth
the bed of the chaste lily and the rose
watwhat month than may was fitter to disclose
this prince of flowers soon shoot thou up and grow
the same that thou art promisd but be slow
and long in changing let our nephews see
thee quickly the gardens eye to be


and there to stand so haste now envious moon
and interpose thy self care not how soon
and threat the great eclipse two hours but run
sol will reshine if not c h a r l e s hath a son


hail mary full of grace it once was said
and by an angel to the blessedst maid
the mother of our lord why may not i
without profaneness yet a poet cry
hail mary full of honours to my queen
the mother of our prince when was there seen
except the joy that the first mary brought
whereby the safety of mankind was wrought
so general a gladness to an isle
to make the hearts of a whole nation smile
as in this prince let it be lawful so
to compare small with great as still we owe
glory to god then hail to mary spring
of so much safety to the realm and king


p publick joy remember
this sixteenth of november
some brave uncommon way
and though the parishsteeple
be silent to the people
ring thou it holyday


mel what though the thrifty tower
and guns there spare to pour
their noises forth in thunder
as fearful to awake
this city or to shake
their guarded gates asunder


thal yet let our trumpets sound
and cleave both air and ground
with beating of our drums
let every lyre be strong
harp lute theorbo sprung
with touch of dainty thums


eut that when the quire is full
the harmony may pull
the angels from their sphears
and each intelligence
may wish it self a sense
whilst it the ditty hears


terp behold the royal mary
the daughter of great harry
and sister to just lewis
comes in the pomp and glory
of all her brothers story
and of her fathers prowess

as here no venus were
but that she reigning here
had got the ceston on

hath taken twice the ring
upon his pointed lance
whilst all the ravishd rout
do mingle in a shout
hey for the flower of france


ura this day the court doth measure
her joy in state and pleasure
and with a reverend fear
the revels and the play
sum up this crowned day
her two and twentith year


poly sweet happy mary all

so fruitful and so fair

what can the cause be when the k hath given
his poet sack the houshold will not pay
are they so scanted in their store or driven
for want of knowing the poet to say him nay
well they should know him would the k but grant
his poet leave to sing his houshold true
held frame such ditties of their store and want
would make the very greencloth to look blue
and rather wish in their expence of sack
so the allowance from the king to use
as the old bard should no canary lack
t were better spare a but than spill his muse
for in the genius of a poets verse
the kings fame lives go now deny his tierce


son and my friend i had not calld you so
to me or been the same to you if show
profit or chance had made us but i know
what by that name we each to other owe
freedom and truth with love from those begot
wisecrafts on which the flatterer ventures not
his is more safe commodity or none
nor dares he come in the comparison
but as the wretched painter who so ill
painted a dog that now his subtler skill
was t have a boy stand with a club and fright
all live dogs from the lane and his shops sight
till he had sold his piece drawn so unlike
so doth the flattrer with fair cunning strike
at a friends freedom proves all circling means
to keep him off and howsoeer he gleans
some of his forms he lets him not come near
where he would fix for the distinctions fear
for as at distance few have faculty
to judge so all men coming near can spy
though now of flattery as of picture are
more subtle works and finer pieces far
than knew the former ages yet to life
all is but web and painting be the strife
never so great to get them and the ends
rather to boast rich hangings than rare friends


brave infant of saguntum clear
thy coming forth in that great year
when the prodigious hannibal did crown
his rage with razing your immortal town
thou looking then about
ere thou wert half got out
wise child didst hastily return
and madst thy mothers womb thine urn
how summd a circle didst thou leave mankind
of deepest lore could we the center find


did wiser nature draw thee back
from out the horror of that sack
where shame faith honour and regard of right
lay trampled on the deeds of death and night
urgd hurried forth and horld
upon th affrighted world
sword fire and famine with fell fury met
and all on utmost ruin set
as could they but lifes miseries foresee
no doubt all infants would return like thee


for what is life if measurd by the space
not by the act
or masked man if valud by his face
above his fact
heres one outlivd his peers
and told forth fourscore years
he vexed time and busied the whole state
troubled both foes and friends
but ever to no ends
what did this stirrer but die late
how well at twenty had he faln or stood
for three of his fourscore he did no good


he entred well by vertuous parts
got up and thrivd with honest arts
he purchasd friends and fame and honours then
and had his noble name advancd with men
but weary of that flight
he stoopd in all mens sight
to sordid flatteries acts of strife
and sunk in that dead sea of life
so deep as he did then deaths waters sup
but that the cork of title buoyd him up


alas but morison fell young
he never fell thou fallst my tongue
he stood a soldier to the last right end
a perfect patriot and a noble friend
but most a vertuous son
all offices were done
by him so ample full and round
in weight in measure number sound
as though his age imperfect might appear
his life was of humanity the sphere


go now and tell our days summd up with fears
and make them years
produce thy mass of miseries on the stage
to swell thine age
repeat of things a throng
to shew thou hast been long
not livd for life doth her great actions spell
by what was done and wrought
in season and so brought
to light her measures are how well
each syllable answerd and was formd how fair
these make the lines of life and thats her air


it is not growing like a tree
in bulk doth make man better be
or standing long an oak three hundred year
to fall a log at last dry bold and sear
a lily of a day
is fairer far in may
although it fall and die that night
it was the plant and fowerflower of light
in small proportions we just beauties see
and in short measures life may perfect be

johnson who sung this of him ere he went
himself to rest
or taste a part of that full joy he meant
to have exprest
in this bright asterism
where it were friendships schism
were not his lucius long with us to tarry
to separate these twilights the dioscuri
and keep the one half from his harry
but fate doth so alternate the design
whilst that in heaven this light on earth must shine


and shine as you exalted are
two names of friendship but one star
of hearts the union and those not by chance
made or indenture or leasd out tadvance
the profits for a time
no pleasures vain did chime
of rhymes or riots at your feasts
orgies of drink or feignd protests
but simple love of greatness and of good
that knits brave minds and manners more than blood


this made you first to know the why
you likd then after to apply


that liking and approach so one the tother
till either grew a portion of the other
each stiled by his end
the copy of his friend
you livd to be the great surnames
and titles by which all made claims
unto the vertue nothing perfect done
but as a cary or a morison


and such a force the fair example had
as they that saw
the good and durst not practice it were glad
that such a law
was left yet to mankind
where they might read and find
friendship indeed was written not in words
and with the heart not pen
of two so early men
whose lines her rolls were and records
who ere the first downbloomed on the chin
had sowd these fruits and got the harvest in


poor wretched states prest by extremities
are fain to seek for succours and supplies
of princes aids or good mens charities


disease the enemy and his ingineers
want with the rest of his conceald compeers
have cast a trench about me now five years


and made those strong approaches by false braies
reduicts halfmoons hornworks and such close ways
the muse not peeps out one of hundred days


but lies blockd up and streightned narrowd in
fixd to the bed and boards unlike to win
health or scarce breath as she had never bin


unless some saving honour of the crown
dare think it to relieve no less renown
a bedrid wit than a besieged town


this is king charles his day speak it thou tower
unto the ships and they from tier to tier
discharge it bout the island in an hour
as loud as thunder and as swift as fire
let ireland meet it out at sea half way
repeating all great britains joy and more
adding her own glad accents to this day
like echo playing from the other shore
what drums or trumpets or great ordnance can
the poetry of steeples with the bells
three kingdoms mirth in light and ary man
made lighter with the wine all noises else


at bonefires rockets fireworks with the shouts
that cry that gladness which their hearts would pray
had they but grace of thinking at these routs
on th often coming of this holyday
and ever close the burden of the song
still to have such a charles but this charles long


the wish is great but where the prince is such
what prayers people can you think too much


look up thou seed of envy and still bring
thy faint and narrow eyes to read the king
in his great actions view whom his large hand
hath raisd to be the port unto his land
w e s t o n that waking man that eye of state
who seldom sleeps whom bad men only hate
why do i irritate or stir up thee
thou sluggish spawn that canst but wilt not see
feed on thy self for spight and shew thy kind
to vertue and true worth be ever blind
dream thou couldst hurt it but before thou wake
t effect it feel thouast made thine own heart ake


such pleasure as the teeming earth
doth take in easie natures birth
when she puts forth the life of evry thing
and in a dew of sweetest rain
she lies deliverd without pain
of the prime beauty of the year the spring
the rivers in their shores do run
the clouds rack clear before the sun
the rudest winds obey the calmest air
rare plants from evry bank do rise
and evry plant the sense surprize
because the order of the whole is fair
the very verdure of her nest
wherein she sits so richly drest
as all the wealth of season there was spread
doth show the graces and the hours
have multiplid their arts and powers
in making soft her aromatick bed
such joys such sweets doth your return
bring all your friends fair lord that burn
with love to hear your modesty relate
the busness of your blooming wit
with all the fruit shall follow it
both to the honour of the king and state
o how will then our court be pleasd
to see great charles of travail easd
when he beholds a graft of his own hand
shoot up an olive fruitful fair
to be a shadow to his heir
and both a strength and beauty to his land


though thou hast past thy summer standingstay
a while with us bright sun and help our light
thou canst not meet more glory on the way
between thy tropicks to arrest thy sight
than thou shalt see to day
we woo thee stay
and see what can be seen
the bounty of a king and beauty of his queen


see the procession what a holy day
bearing the promise of some better fate
hath filled with cacoches all the way
from greenwich hither to rowhamptongate
when lookd the year at best
so like a feast
or were affairs in tune
by all the sphears consent so in the heart of june


what beauty of beauties and bright youths at charge
of summers liveries and gladding green
do boast their loves and bravries so at large
as they came all to see and to be seen
when lookd the earth so fine
or so did shine
in all her bloom and flower
to welcome home a pair and deck the nuptial bower


it is the kindly season of the time
the month of youth which calls all creatures forth
to do their offices in natures chime
and celebrate perfection at the worth
marriage the end of life
that holy strife
and the allowed war
through which not only we but all our species are


hark how the bells upon the waters play
their sistertunes from thames his either side
as they had learnd new changes for the day
and all did ring th approaches of the bride
the lady frances drest
above the rest
of all the maidens fair
in graceful ornament of garland gems and hair


see how she paceth forth in virginwhite
like what she is the daughter of a duke
and sister darting forth a dazling light
on all that come her simpless to rebuke
her tresses trim her back
as she did lack
nought of a maiden queen
with modesty so crownd and adoration seen


stay thou wilt see what rites the virgins do
the choicest virgintroop of all the land
porting the ensigns of united two
both crowns and kingdoms in their either hand
whose majesties appear
to make more clear
this feast than can the day
although that thou o sun at our intreaty stay


see how with roses and with lilies shine
lillies and roses flowers of either sex
the bright brides paths embellishd more than thine
with light of love this pair doth intertex
stay see the virgins sow
where she shall go
the emblems of their way
o now thou smilst fair sun and shinst as thou wouldst stay


with what full hands and in how plenteous showers
have they bedewd the earth where she doth tread
as if her airy steps did spring the flowers
and all the ground were garden where she led
see at another door
on the same floor
the bridegroom meets the bride
with all the pomp of youth and all our court beside


our court and all the grandees now sun look
and looking with thy best inquiry tell
in all thy age of journals thou hast took
sawst thou that pair became these rites so well
save the preceeding two
who in all they do
search sun and thou wilt find
they are th exampled pair and mirror of their kind


force from the phnix then no rarity
of sex to rob the creature but from man
the king of creatures take his parity
with angels muse to speak these nothing can
illustrate these but they
themselves to day
who the whole act express
all else we see beside are shadows and go less


it is their grace and favour that makes seen
and wonderd at the bounties of this day
all is a story of the king and queen
and what of dignity and honour may
be duly done to those
whom they have chose
and set the mark upon
to give a greater name and title to their own


weston their treasure as their treasurer
that mine of wisdom and of counsels deep
great saymaster of state who cannot err
but doth his carract and just standard keep
in all the provd assays
and legal ways
of tryals to work down
mens loves unto the laws and laws to love the crown


and this well movd the judgment of the king
to pay with honours to his noble son
to day the fathers service who could bring
him up to do the same himself had done
that farallseeing eye
could soon espy
what kind of waking man
he had so highly set and in what barbican


stand there for when a noble natures raisd
it brings friends joy foes grief posterity fame
in him the times no less than prince are praisd
and by his rise in active men his name
doth emulation stir
to th dull a spur
it is to th envious meant
a meer upbraiding grief and tortring punishment


see now the chapel opens where the king
and bishop stay to consummate the rites
the holy prelate prays then takes the ring
asks first who gives her i charles then he plights
one in the others hand
whilst they both stand
hearing their charge and then
the solemn quire cries joy and they return amen


o happy bands and thou more happy place
which to this use wert built and consecrate
to have thy god to bless thy king to grace
and this their chosen bishop celebrate
and knit the nuptial knot
which time shall not
or cankerd jealousie
with all corroding arts be able to untie


the chapel empties and thou mayst be gone
now sun and post away the rest of day
these two now holy church hath made them one
do long to make themselves so another way
there is a feast behind
to them of kind
which their glad parents taught
one to the other long ere these to light were brought


haste haste officious sun and send them night
some hours before it should that these may know
all that their fathers and their mothers might
of nuptial sweets at such a season owe
to propagate their names
and keep their fames
alive which else would die
for fame keeps vertue up and it posterity


th ignoble never livd they were awhile
like swine or other cattel here on earth
their names are not recorded on the file
of life that fall so christians know their birth
alone and such a race
we pray may grace
your fruitful spreading vine
but dare not ask our wish in language fescennine


yet as we may we will with chaste desires
the holy perfumes of the marriagebed
be kept alive those sweet and sacred fires
of love between you and your lovelyhead
that when you both are old
you find no cold
there but renewed say
after the last child born this is our weddingday


till you behold a race to fill your hall
a richard and a hierome by their names
upon a thomas or a francis call
a kate a frank to honor their granddames
and tween their grandsires thighs
like pretty spies
peep forth a gem to see
how each one plays his part of the large pedigree


and never may there want one of the stem
to be a watchful servant for this state
but like an arm of eminence mongst them
extend a reaching vertue early and late
whilst the main tree still found
upright and sound
by this suns noonsteds made
so great his body now alone projects the shade


they both are slippd to bed shut fast the door
and let him freely gather loves firstfruits
hes master of the office yet no more
exacts than she is pleasd to pay no suits
strifes murmurs or delay
will last till day
night and the sheets will show
the longing couple all that elder lovers know


that whereas your royal father
j a m e s the blessed pleasd the rather
of his special grace to letters
to make all the m u s e s debtors
to his bounty by extension
of a free poetick pension
a large hundred marks annuity
to be given me in gratuity
for done service and to come
and that this so accepted sum
or dispensd in books or bread
for with both the m u s e was fed
hath drawn on me from the times
all the envy of the rhymes
and the ratling pitpatnoise
of the less poetick boys
when their potguns aim to hit
with their pellets of small wit
parts of me they judgd decayd
but we last out still unlayd
please your majesty to make
of your grace for goodness sake
those your fathers marks your pounds
let their spite which now abounds
then go on and do its worst
this would all their envy burst
and so warm the poets tongue
yould read a snake in his next song


if to my mind great lord i had a state
i would present you now with curious plate
of noremberg or turky hang your rooms
not with the arras but the persian looms
i would if price or prayer could them get
send in what or romano tintaret
titian or raphael michael angelo
have left in fame to equal or outgo
the old greek hands in picture or in stone
this i would do could i know weston one
catchd with these arts wherein the judge is wise
as far as sense and only by the eyes
but you i know my lord and know you can
discern between a statue and a man
can do the things that statues do deserve
and act the business which they paint or carve
what you have studied are the arts of life
to compose men and manners stint the strife
of murmuring subjects make the nations know
what worlds of blessings to good kings they owe
and mightiest monarchs feel what large increase
of sweets and safeties they possess by peace
these i look up at with a reverend eye
and strike religion in the standersby
which though i cannot as an architect
in glorious piles or pyramids erect
unto your honour i can tune in song
aloud and happly it may last as long


tho happy muse thou know my digby well
yet read him in these lines he doth excel
in honour courtesie and all the parts
court can call hers or man could call his arts
hes prudent valiant just and temperate
in him all vertue is beheld in state
and he is built like some imperial room
for that to dwell in and be still at home
his breast is a brave palace a broad street
where all heroick ample thoughts do meet
where nature such a large survey hath taen
as other souls to his dwelt in a lane
witness his action done at scanderone
upon my birthday the eleventh of june
when the apostle barnaby the bright
unto our year doth give the longest light
in sign the subject and the song will live
which i have vowd posterity to give
go muse in and salute him say he be
busie or frown at first when he sees thee
he will clear up his forehead think thou bringst
good omen to him in the note thou singst
for he doth love my verses and will look
upon them next to spencers noble book
and praise them too o what a fame t will be
what reputation to my lines and me
when he shall read them at the treasurers board
the knowing weston and that learned lord
allows them then what copies shall be had
what transcripts beggd how cryd up and how glad
wilt thou be muse when this shall them befall
being sent to one they will be read of all

to day old janus opens the new year
and shuts the old haste haste all loyal swains
that know the times and seasons when t appear
and offer your just service on these plains
best kings expect firstfruits of your glad gains


p a n is the great preserver of our bounds
to him we owe all profits of our grounds
our milk our fells our fleeces and first lambs
our teeming ewes and lusty mounting rams
see where he walks with m i r a by his side
sound sound his praises loud and with his hers divide


of p a n we sing the best of hunters p a n
that drives the hart to seek unused ways
and in the chase more than s y l v a n u s can
hear o you groves and hills resound his praise


of brightest m i r a do we raise our song
sister of p a n and glory of the spring
who walks on earth as may still went along
rivers and valleys echo what we sing


of p a n we sing the chief of leaders p a n
that leads our flocks and us and calls both forth
to better pastures than great p a l e s can
hear o you groves and hills resound his worth


of brightest m i r a is our song the grace
of all that nature yet to life did bring
and were she lost could best supply her place
rivers and valleys echo what we sing


whereer they tread th enamourd ground
the fairest flowers are always found
as if the beauties of the year
still waited on em where they were
he is the father of our peace
she to the crown hath brought increase
we know no other power than his
p a n only our great sheperd is
our great our good where ones so drest
in truth of colours both are best


haste haste you hither all you gentler swains
that have a flock or herd upon these plains
this is the great preserver of our bounds
to whom you owe all duties of your grounds
your milks your fells your fleeces and first lambs
your teeming ewes as well as mounting rams
whose praises let s report unto the woods
that they may take it echod by the floods

he drives diseases from our folds
the thief from spoil his presence holds

this only the great sheperd is


fair friend tis true your beauties move
my heart to a respect
too little to be paid with love
too great for your neglect


i neither love nor yet am free
for though the flame i find
be not intense in the degree
tis of the purest kind


it little wants of love but pain
your beauty takes my sense
and lest you should that price disdain
my thoughts too feel the influence


tis not a passions first access
ready to multiply
but like loves calmest state it is
possest with victory


it is like love to truth reducd
all the false values gone
which were created and inducd
by fond imagination


tis either fancy or tis fate
to love you more than i
i love you at your beauties rate
less were an injury


like unstampd gold i weigh each grace
so that you may collect
th intrinsick value of your face
safely from my respect


and this respect would merit love
were not so fair a sight
payment enough for who dare move
reward for his delight


rouse up thy self my gentle muse
though now our green conceits be gray
and yet once more do not refuse
to take thy phrygian harp and play
in honour of this cheerful day
long may they both contend to prove
that best of crowns is such a love


make first a song of joy and love
which chastly flames in royal eyes
then tune it to the spheres above
when the benignest stars do rise
and sweet conjunctions grace the skies


to this let all good hearts resound
whilst diadems invest his head
long may he live whose life doth bound
more than his laws and better led
by high example than by dread


long may he round about him see
his roses and his lilies bloom
long may his only dear and he
joy in idas of their own
and kingdoms hopes so timely sown


that thou art lovd of god this work is done
great king thy having of a second son
and by thy blessing may thy people see
how much they are belovd of god in thee
would they would understand it princes are
great aids to empire as they are great care
to pious parents who would have their blood
should take first seisin of the publick good
as hath thy j a m e s cleansd from original dross
this day by baptism and his saviours cross
grow up sweet babe as blessed in thy name
as in renewing thy good grandsires fame
me thought great britain in her sea before
sate safe enough but now secured more
at land she triumphs in the triple shade
her rose and lily intertwind have made


what gentle ghost besprent with april dew
hails me so solemnly to yonder yew
and beckning wooes me from the fatal tree
to pluck a garland for her self or me
i do obey you beauty for in death
you seem a fair one o that you had breath
to give your shade a name stay stay i feel
a horror in me all my blood is steel
stiff stark my joints gainst one another knock
whose daughter ha great savage of the rock
hes good as great i am almost a stone
and eer i can ask more of her shes gone
alas i am all marble write the rest
thou wouldst have written fame upon my breast
it is a large fair table and a true
and the disposure will be something new
when i who would the poet have become
at least may bear th inscription to her tomb
she was the lady jane and marchioness
of winchester the heralds can tell this
earl rivers grandchild serve not forms good fame
sound thou her vertues give her soul a name
had i a thousand mouths as many tongues
and voice to raise them from my brazen lungs
i durst not aim at that the dotes were such
thereof no notion can express how much
their carract was i or my trump must break
but rather i should i of that part speak
it is too near of kin to heaven the soul
to be describd fames fingers are too foul
to touch these mysteries we may admire
the blaze and splendor but not handle fire
what she did here by great example well
t inlive posterity her fame may tell
and calling truth to witness make that good
from the inherent graces in her blood
else who doth praise a person by a new
but a faind way doth rob it of the true
her sweetness softness her fair courtesie
her wary guards her wise simplicity
were like a ring of vertues bout her set
and piety the center where all met
a reverend state she had an awful eye
a dazling yet inviting majesty


what nature fortune institution fact
could summ to a perfection was her act
how did she leave the world with what contempt
just as she in it livd and so exempt
from all affection when they urgd the cure
of her disease how did her soul assure
her suffrings as the body had been away
and to the torturers her doctors say
stick on your cuppingglasses fear not put
your hottest causticks to burn lance or cut
tis but a body which you can torment
and i into the world all soul was sent
then comforted her lord and blest her son
cheard her fair sisters in her race to run
with gladness temperd her sad parents tears
made her friends joys to get above their fears
and in her last act taught the standersby
with admiration and applause to die
let angels sing her glories who did call
her spirit home to her original
who saw the way was made it and were sent
to carry and conduct the complement
twixt death and life where her mortality
became her birthday to eternity
and now through circumfused light she looks
on natures secrets there as her own books
speaks heavens language and discovereth free
to every order evry hierarchy
beholds her maker and in him doth see
what the beginnings of all beauties be
and all beatitudes that thence do flow
which they that have the crown are sure to know
go now her happy parents and be sad
if you not understand what child you had
if you dare grudge at heaven and repent
t have paid again a blessing was but lent
and trusted so as it deposited lay
at pleasure to be calld for every day
if you can envy your own daughters bliss
and wish her state less happy than it is
if you can cast about your either eye
and see all dead here or about to die
the stars that are the jewels of the night
and day deceasing with the prince of light
the sun great kings and mightiest kingdoms fall
whole nations nay mankind the world with all
that ever had beginning there to ave end
with what injustice should one soul pretend
t escape this common known necessity
when we were all born we began to die
and but for that contention and brave strife
the christian hath t enjoy the future life
he were the wretchedst of the race of men
but as he soars at that he bruiseth then
the serpents head gets above death and sin
and sure of heaven rides triumphing in


fair fame who art ordaind to crown
with evergreen and great renown
theirheadstheir heads that envy would hold down
with her in shade
of death and darkness and deprive
their names of being kept alive
by thee and conscience both who thrive
by the just trade


of goodness still vouchsafe to take
this cradle and for goodness sake
a dedicated ensign make
thereof to time
that all posterity as we
who read what the crepundia be
may something by that twilight see
bove rattling rhyme


for though that rattles timbrels toys
take little infants with their noise
as proprest gifts to girls and boys
of light expence
their corals whistles and prime coats
their painted masks their paper boats
with sails of silk as the first notes
surprize their sense


yet here are no such trifles brought
no cobweb calls no surcoats wrought
with gold or clasps which might be bought
on every stall
but heres a song of her descent
and call to the high parliament
of heaven where seraphim take tent
of ordring all


this utterd by an ancient bard
who claims of reverence to be heard
as coming with his harp prepard
to chant her gree
is sung as als her getting up
by jacobs ladder to the top
of that eternal port kept ope
for such as she


sing the just and uncontrold descent
of dame v e n e t i a d i g b y stild the fair
for mind and body the most excellent
that ever nature or the later air
gave two such houses as n o r t h u m b e r l a n d
and s t a n l e y to which she was coheir


speak it you bold p e n a t e s you that stand
at either stem and know the veins of good
run from your roots tell testifie the grand
meeting of graces that so swelld the flood
of vertues in her as in short she grew
the wonder of her sex and of your blood
and tell thou a l d el e g h none can tell more true
thy nieces line than thou that gavst thy name
into the kindred whence thy adam drew
meschines honour with the cestrian fame


sitting and ready to be drawn
what makes these velvets silks and lawn
embroideries feathers fringes lace
where every limb takes like a face


send these suspected helps to aid
some form defective or decayd
this beauty without falshood fair
needs nought to cloath it but the air


yet something to the painters view
were fitly interposd so new
he shall if he can understand
work with my fancy his own hand


draw first a cloud all save her neck
and out of that make day to break
till like her face it do appear
and men may think all light rose there


then let the beams of that disperse
the cloud and show the universe
but at such distance as the eye
may rather yet adore than spy


the heaven designd draw next a spring
with all that youth or it can bring
four rivers branching forth like seas
and paradise confining these


last draw the circles of this globe
and let there be a starry robe
of constellations bout her horld
and thou hast painted beauties world


but painter see thou do not sell
a copy of this piece nor tell
whose tis but if it favour find
next sitting we will draw her mind


painter yo are come but may be gone
now i have better thought thereon
this work i can perform alone
and give you reasons more than one


not that your art i do refuse
but here i may no colours use
beside your hand will never hit
to draw a thing that cannot sit


you could make shift to paint an eye
an eagle towring in the sky
the sun a sea or soundless pit
but these are like a mind not it


no to express a mind to sense
would ask a heavens intelligence
since nothing can report that flame
but whats of kin to whence it came


sweet mind then speak your self and say
as you go on by what brave way
our sense you do with knowledge fill
and yet remain our wonder still


i call you muse now make it true
henceforchhenceforth may every line be you
that all may say that see the frame
this is no picture but the same


a mind so pure so perfect fine
as tis not radiant but divine
and so disdaining any trier
tis got where it can try the fire


there high exalted in the sphere
as it another nature were
it moveth all and makes a flight
as circular as infinite


whose notions when it will express
in speech it is with that excess
of grace and musick to the ear
as what it spoke it planted there


the voice so sweet the words so fair
as some soft chime had strokd the air
and though the sound were parted thence
still left an echo in the sense


but that a mind so rapt so high
so swift so pure should yet apply
it self to us and come so nigh
earths grossness theres the how and why


is it because it sees us dull
and stuck in clay here it would pull
us forth by some celestial slight
up to her own sublimed hight


or hath she here upon the ground
some paradise or palace found
in all the bounds of beauty fit
for her t inhabit there is it


thrice happy house that hast receipt
for this so lofty form so streight
so polisht perfect round and even
as it slid moulded off from heaven


not swelling like the ocean proud
but stooping gently as a cloud
as smooth as oil pourd forth and calm
as showers and sweet as drops of balm


smooth soft and sweet in all a flood
where it may run to any good
and where it stays it there becomes
a nest of odorous spice and gums


in action winged as the wind
in rest like spirits left behind
upon a bank or field of flowers
begotten by that wind and showers


in thee fair mansion let it rest
yet know with what thou art possest
thou entertaining in thy breast
but such a mind makst god thy guest


boast not these titles of your ancestors
brave youths th are their possessions none of yours
when your own vertues equalld have their names
twill be but fair to lean upon their fames
for they are strong supporters but till then
the greatest are but growing gentlemen
it is a wretched thing to trust to reeds
which all men do that urge not their own deeds
up to their ancestors the rivers side
by which yo are planted shews your fruit shall bide
hang all your rooms with one large pedigree
tis vertue alone is true nobility
which vertue from your father ripe will fall
study illustrious him and you have all


twere time that i dyd too now she is dead
who was my muse and life of all i did
the spirit that i wrote with and conceivd
all that was good or great in me she weavd
and set it forth the rest were cobwebs fine
spun out in name of some of the old nine
to hang a window or make dark the room
till swept away th were cancelld with a broom
nothing that could remain or yet can stir
a sorrow in me fit to wait to her
o had i seen her laid out a fair course
by death on earth i should have had remorse
on nature for her who did let her lie
and saw that portion of her self to die
sleepy or stupid nature couldst thou part
with such a rarity and not rouse art
with all her aids to save her from the seize
of vulture death and those relentless cleys
thou wouldst have lost the phnix had the kind
been trusted to thee not to t self assignd


look on thy sloth and give thy self undone
for so thou art with me now she is gone
my wounded mind cannot sustain this stroke
it rages runs flies stands and would provoke
the world to ruine with it in her fall
i summ up mine own breaking and wish all
thou hast no more blows fate to drive at one
whats left a poet when his muse is gone
sure i am dead and know it not i feel
nothing i do but like a heavy wheel
am turned with anothers powers my passion
whirls me about and to blaspheme in fashion
i murmur against god for having taen
her blessed soul hence forth this valley vane
of tears and dungeon of calamity
i envy it the angels amity
the joy of saints the crown for which it lives
the glory and gain of rest which the place gives
dare i prophane so irreligious be
to greet or grieve her soft euthanasee
so sweetly taken to the court of bliss
as spirits had stoln her spirit in a kiss
from off her pillow and deluded bed
and left her lovely body unthought dead
indeed she is not dead but laid to sleep
in earth till the last trump awake the sheep
and goats together whither they must come
to hear their judge and his eternal doom
to have that final retribution
expected with the fleshes restitution
for as there are three natures schoolmen call
one corporal only th other spiritual
like single so there is a third commixt
of body and spirit together placd betwixt
those other two which must be judgd or crownd
this as it guilty is or guiltless found
must come to take a sentence by the sense
of that great evidence the conscience
who will be there against that day prepard
t accuse or quit all parties to be heard
o day of joy and surety to the just
who in that feast of resurrection trust
that great eternal holyday of rest
to body and soul where love is all the guest
and the whole banquet is full fightsight of god
of joy the circle and sole period
all other gladness with the thought is barrd
hope hath her end and faith hath her reward
this being thus why should my tongue or pen
presume to interpel that fulness when
nothing can more adorn it than the seat
that she is in or make it more compleat
better be dumb than superstitious
who violates the godhead is most vicious
against the nature he would worship he
will honourd be in all simplicity
have all his actions wondred at and viewd
with silence and amazement not with rude
dull and prophane weak and imperfect eyes
have busie search made in his mysteries
he knows what work h hath done to call this guest
out of her noble body to this feast
and give her place according to her blood
amongst her peers those princes of all good
saints martyrs prophets with those hierarchies
angels archangels principalities
the dominations vertues and the powers
the thrones the cherub and seraphick bowers
that planted round there sing before the lamb
a new song to his praise and great i am
and she doth know out of the shade of death
what t is t enjoy an everlasting breath
to have her captivd spirit freed from flesh
and on her innocence a garment fresh


and white as that put on and in her hand
with boughs of palm a crowned victrice stand
and will you worthy son sir knowing this
put black and mourning on and say you miss
a wife a friend a lady or a love
whom her redeemer honourd hath above
her fellows with the oyl of gladness bright
in heavenheavens empire and with a robe of light
thither you hope to come and there to find
that pure that pretious and exalted mind
you once enjoyd a short space severs yee
compard unto that long eternity
that shall rejoyn ye was she then so dear
when she departed you will meet her there
much more desird and dearer then before
by all the wealth of blessings and the store
accumulated on her by the lord
of life and light the son of god the word
there all the happy souls that ever were
shall meet with gladness in one theatre
and each shall know there one anothers face
by beatifick vertue of the place
there shall the brother with the sister walk
and sons and daughters with their parents talk
but all of god they still shall have to say
but make him all in all their theme that day
that happy day that never shall see night
where he will be all beauty to the sight
wine or delicious fruits unto the taste
a musick in the ears will ever last
unto the scent a spicery or balm
and to the touch a flower like soft as palm
he will all glory all perfection be
god in the union and the trinity
that holy great and glorious mystery
will there revealed be in majesty
by light and comfort of spiritual grace
the vision of our saviour face to face
in his humanity to hear him preach
the price of our redemption and to teach
through his inherent righteousness in death
the safety of our souls and forfeit breath
what fulness of beatitude is here
what love with mercy mixed doth appear
to stile us friends who were by nature foes
adopt us heirs by grace who were of those
had lost our selves and prodigally spent
our native portions and possessed rent
yet have all debts forgiven us and advance
b imputed right to an inheritance
in his eternal kingdom where we sit
equal with angels and coheirs of it
nor dare we under blasphemy conceive
he that shall be our supreme judge should leave
himself so uninformd of his elect
who knows the hearts of all and can dissect
the smallest fibre of our flesh he can
find all our atoms from a point t a span
our closest creeks and corners and can trace
each line as it were graphick in the face
and best he knew her noble character
for twas himself who formd and gave it her
and to that form lent two such veins of blood
as nature could not more increase the flood
of title in her all nobility
but pride that schism of incivility
she had and it became her she was fit
t have known no envy but by fuffringsuffring it
she had a mind as calm as she was fair
not tost or troubled with light ladyair
but kept an even gate as some streight tree
movd by the wind so comely moved she
and by the awful manage of her eye
she swaid all busness in the family


to one she said do this he did it so
to another move he went to a third go
he run and all did strive with diligence
t obey and serve her sweet commandments
she was in one a many parts of life
a tender mother a discreeter wife
a solemn mistress and so good a friend
so charitable to religious end
in all her petite actions so devote
as her whole life was now become one note
of piety and private holiness
she spent more time in tears her self to dress
for her devotions and those sad essays
of sorrow then all pomp of gaudy days
and came forth ever cheered with the rod
of divine comfort when sh had talkd with god
her broken sighs did never miss whole sense
nor can the bruised heart want eloquence
for prayer is the incense most perfumes
the holy altars when it least presumes
and hers were all humility they beat
the door of grace and found the mercyseat
in frequent speaking by the pious psalms
her solemn hours she spent or giving alms
or doing other deeds of charity
to clothe the naked feed the hungry she
would sit in an infirmerinfirmary whole days
poring as on a map to find the ways
to that eternal rest where now sh hath place
by sure election and predestind grace
she saw her saviour by an early light
incarnate in the manger shining bright
on all the world she saw him on the cross
suffring and dying to redeem our loss
she saw him rise triumphing over death
to justifie and quicken us in breath
she saw him too in glory to ascend
for his designed work the perfect end
of raising judging and rewarding all
the kind of man on whom his doom should fall
all this by faith she saw and framd a plea
in manner of a daily apostrophe
to him should be her judge true god true man
jesus the only gotten christ who can
as being redeemer and repairer too
of lapsed nature best know what to do
in that great act of judgment which the father
hath given wholly to the son the rather
as being the son of man to shew his power
his wisdom and his justice in that hour
the last of hours and shutter up of all
where first his power will appear by call
of all are dead to life his wisdom show
in the discerning of each conscience so
and most his justice in the fitting parts
and giving dues to all mankinds deserts
in this sweet extasie she was rapt hence
who reads will pardon my intelligence
that thus have venturd these true strains upon
to publish her a saint my muse is gone


happy is he that from all business clear
as the old race of mankind were
with his own oxen tills his sires left lands
and is not in the usurers bands
nor soldierlike started with rough alarms
nor dreads the seas inraged harms
but flees the bar and courts with the proud bords
and waiting chambers of great lords
the poplar tall he then doth marrying twine
with the grown issue of the vine
and with his hook lops off the fruitless race
and sets more happy in the place
or in the bending vale beholds afar
the lowing herds there grazing are
or the prest honey in pure pots doth keep
of earth and shears the tender sheep
or when that autumn through the fields lifts round
his head with mellow apples crownd
how plucking pears his own hand grafted had
and purplematching grapes hes glad
with which priapus he may thank thy hands
and sylvane thine that keptst his lands
then now beneath some ancient oak he may
now in the rooted grass him lay
whilst from the higher banks do slide the floods
the soft birds quarrel in the woods
the fountains murmur as the streams do creep
and all invite to easie sleep
then when the thundring jove his snow and showers
are gathering by the wintry hours
or hence or thence he drives with many a hound
wild boars into his toils pitchd round
or strains on his small fork his subtil nets
for th eating thrush or pitfalls sets
and snares the fearful hare and newcome crane
and counts them sweet rewards so taen
who amongst these delights would not forget
loves cares so evil and so great
but if to boot with these a chaste wife meet
for houshold aid and children sweet
such as the sabines or a sunburntblowse
some lusty quick apulians spouse
to deck the hallowd harth with old wood fird
against the husband comes home tird
that penning the glad flock in hurdles by
their swelling udders doth draw dry
and from the sweet tub wine of this year takes
and unbought viands ready makes
not lucrine oysters i could then more prize
nor turbot nor bright golden eyes
if with bright floods the winter troubled much
into our seas send any such
th ionian godwit nor the ginnyhen
could not go down my belly then
more sweet than olives that new gatherd be
from fattest branches of the tree
or the herb sorrel that loves meadows still
or mallows loosing bodies ill
or at the feast of bounds the lamb then slain
or kid forct from the wolf again
among these cates how glad the sight doth come
of the fed flocks approaching home
to view the weary oxen draw with bare
and fainting necks the turned share
the wealthy houshold swarm of bondmen met
and bout the steeming chimney set
these thoughts when usurer alphius now about
to turn more farmer had spoke out
gainst th ides his moneys he gets in with pain
at th calends puts all out again


venus again thou movst a war
long intermitted pray thee pray thee spare
i am not such as in the reign
of the good cynara i was refrain
sowre mother of sweet loves forbear
to bend a man now at his fiftieth year
too stubborn for commands so slack
go where youths soft intreaties call thee back
more timely hie thee to the house
with thy bright swans of paulus maximus
there jest and feast make him thine host
if a fit liver thou dost seek to toast
for hes both noble lovely young
and for the troubled client fillsfiles his tongue
child of a hundred arts and far
will he display the ensigns of thy war
and when he smiling finds his grace
with thee bove all his rivals gifts take place
he will thee a marble statue make
beneath a sweet wood roof neer alba lake
there shall thy dainty nostril take
in many a gum and for thy soft ears sake
shall verse be set to harp and lute
and phrygian hauboy not without the flute
there twice a day in sacred lays
the youths and tender maids shall sing thy praise
and in the salian manner meet
thrice bout thy altar with their ivory feet
me now nor wench nor wanton boy
delights nor credulous hope of mutual joy
nor care i now healths to propound
or with fresh flowers to girt my temple round
but why oh why my ligurine
flow my thin tears down these pale cheeks of mine
or why my wellgracd words among
with an uncomely silence fails my tongue
hardhearted i dream every night
i hold thee fast but fled hence with the light
whether in mars his field thou be
or tybers winding streams i follow thee


whilst lydia i was lovd of thee
and bout thy ivory neck no youth did fling
his arms more acceptably free
i thought me richer than the persian king
lyd whilst horace lovd no mistris more
nor after chloe did his lydia sound
in name i went all names before
the roman ilia was not more renownd
hor tis true i am thracian chloes i
who sings so sweet and with such cunning plays
as for her ild not fear to die
so fate would give her life and longer days
lyd and i am mutually on fire
with gentle calais thurine orniths son
for whom i doubly would expire
so fates would let the boy a long thred run
hor but say old love return should make
and us disjoind force to her brazen yoke
that i bright chloe off should shake
and to leftlydia now the gate stood ope
lyd though he be fairer than a star
thou lighter than the bark of any tree
and than rough adria angrier far
yet would i wish to love live die with thee


doing a filthy pleasure is and short
and done we straight repent us of the sport
let us not then rush blindly on unto it
like lustful beasts that only know to do it
for lust will languish and that heat decay
but thus thus keeping endless holyday
let us together closely lie and kiss
there is no labour nor no shame in this
this hath pleasd doth please and long will please never
can this decay but is beginning ever


liber of all thy friends thou sweetest care
thou worthy in eternal flower to fare
if thou best wise with syrian oil let shine
thy locks and rosie garlands crown thy head
dark thy clear glass with old falernian wine
and heat with softest love thy softer bed
he that but living half his days dies such
makes his life longer than twas given him much


beyond the path of the outmost sun through utter darkness hurled
further than ever comet flared or vagrant stardust swirled
live such as fought and sailed and ruled and loved and made our world


they are purged of pride because they died they know the worth of their bays
they sit at wine with the maidens nine and the gods of the elder days
it is their will to serve or be still as fitteth our fathers praise


tis theirs to sweep through the ringing deep where azraels outposts are
or buffet a path through the pits red wrath when god goes out to war
or hang with the reckless seraphim on the rein of a redmaned star


they dare not grieve for her pain
they know of toil and the end of toil they know gods law is plain
so they whistle the devil to make them sport who know that sin is vain


and ofttimes cometh our wise lord god master of every trade
and tells them tales of his daily toil of edens newly made
and they rise to their feet as he passes by gentlemen unafraid


to these who are cleansed of base desire sorrow and lust and shame
gods for they knew the hearts of men men for they stooped to fame
borne on the breath that men call death my brothers spirit came


he scarce had need to doff his pride or slough the dross of earth
een as he trod that day to god so walked he from his birth
in simpleness and gentleness and honour and clean mirth


so cup to lip in fellowship they gave him welcome high
and made him place at the banquet board the strong men ranged thereby
who had done his work and held his peace and had no fear to die


beyond the loom of the last lone star through open darkness hurled
further than rebel comet dared or hiving starswarm swirled
sits he with those that praise our god for that they served his world


i have made for you a song
and it may be right or wrong
but only you can tell me if its true
i have tried for to explain
both your pleasure and your pain
and thomas heres my best respects to you


o therell surely come a day
when theyll give you all your pay
and treat you as a christian ought to do
so until that day comes round
heaven keep you safe and sound
and thomas heres my best respects to you

with his coffinheaded shield an shovelspear
an happy day with fuzzy on the rush
will last an healthy tommy for a year
so heres to you fuzzywuzzy an your friends which are no more
if we hadnt lost some messmates we would help you to deplore
but give an takes the gospel an well call the bargain fair
for if you have lost more than us you crumpled up the square


he rushes at the smoke when we let drive
an before we know hes hackin at our head
hes all hot sand an ginger when alive
an hes generally shammin when hes dead
hes a daisy hes a ducky hes a lamb
hes a injiarubber idiot on the spree
hes the ony thing that doesnt give a damn
for a regiment o british infantree
so heres to you fuzzywuzzy at your home in the soudan
youre a pore benighted heathen but a firstclass fightin man
an heres to you fuzzywuzzy with your hayrick head of hair
you big black boundin beggar for you broke a british square


you may talk o gin and beer
when youre quartered safe out here
an youre sent to pennyfights an aldershot it
but when it comes to slaughter
you will do your work on water
an youll lick the bloomin boots of him thats got it
now in injias sunny clime
where i used to spend my time
aservin of her majesty the queen
of all them blackfaced crew
the finest man i knew
was our regimental bhisti gunga din


wot makes the soldiers heart to penk wot makes him to perspire
it isnt standin up to charge nor lyin down to fire
but its everlastin waitin on a everlastin road
for the commissariat camel an his commissariat load
o the oont o the oont o the commissariat oont
with his silly neck abobbin like a basket full o snakes
we packs him like an idol an you ought to hear him grunt
an when we gets him loaded up his blessed girthrope breaks


wot makes the rearguard swear so hard when night is drorin in
an every native follower is shiverin for his skin
it aint the chanst o being rushed by paythans from the hills
its the commissariat camel puttin on his bloomin frills
o the oont o the oont o the hairy scary oont
atrippin over tentropes when weve got the night alarm
we socks him with a stretcherpole an heads him off in front
an when weve saved his bloomin life he chaws our bloomin arm


the horse he knows above a bit the bullocks but a fool
the elephants a gentleman the batterymules a mule
but the commissariat camuel when all is said an done
hes a devil an a ostrich an a orphanchild in one
o the oont o the oont o the gawdforsaken oont
the lumpyhumpy humminbird asingin where he lies
hes blocked the whole division from the rearguard to the front
an when we get him up again the beggar goes an dies


hell gall an chafe an lame an fight he smells most awful vile
hell lose hisself for ever if you let him stray a mile
hes game to graze the hole day long an howl the hole night through
an when he comes to greasy ground he splits hisself in two
o the oont o the oont o the floppin droppin oont
when his long legs give from under an his meltin eye is dim
the tribes is up behind us and the tribes is out in front
it aint no jam for tommy but its kites an crows for him


so when the cruel march is done an when the roads is blind
an when we sees the camp in front an hears the shots behind
ho then we strips his saddle off and all his woes is past
he thinks on us that used him so and gets revenge at last
o the oont o the oont o the floatin bloatin oont
the late lamented camel in the watercut he lies
we keeps a mile behind him an we keeps a mile in front
but he gets into the drinkincasks and then o course we dies


this happened in a battle to a battry of the corps
which is first among the women an amazin first in war
an what the bloomin battle was i dont remember now
but twos offlead he answered to the name o snarleyow
down in the infantry nobody cares
down in the cavalry colonel he swears
but down in the lead with the wheel at the flog
turns the bold bombardier to a little whipped dog


they was movin into action they was needed very sore
to learn a little schoolin to a native army corps
they had nipped against an uphill they was tuckin down the brow
when a tricky trundlin roundshot give the knock to snarleyow


they cut him loose an left him he was almost tore in two
but he tried to follow after as a welltrained horse should do
he went an fouled the limber an the drivers brother squeals
pull up pull up for snarleyow his heads between his heels


the driver humped his shoulder for the wheels was goin round
an there aint no stop conductor when a battrys changin ground
sez he i broke the beggar in an very sad i feels
but i couldnt pull up not for you your head between your heels


he hadnt hardly spoke the word before a droppin shell
a little right the battry an between the sections fell
an when the smoke had cleared away before the limber wheels
there lay the drivers brother with his head between his heels


then sez the drivers brother an his words was very plain
for gawds own sake get over me an put me out o pain
they saw his wounds was mortial an they judged that it was best
so they took an drove the limber straight across his back an chest


the driver he give nothin cept a little coughin grunt
but he swung his horses handsome when it came to action front
an if one wheel was juicy you may lay your monday head
twas juicier for the niggers when the case begun to spread


the moril of this story it is plainly to be seen
you havnt got no families when servin of the queen
you havnt got no brothers fathers sisters wives or sons
if you want to win your battles take an work your bloomin guns
down in the infantry nobody cares
down in the cavalry colonel he swears
but down in the lead with the wheel at the flog
turns the bold bombardier to a little whipped dog


there was a row in silver street thats near to dublin quay
between an irish regiment an english cavalree
it started at revelly an it lasted on till dark
the first man dropped at harrisons the last forninst the park


there was a row in silver street the regiments was out
they called us delhi rebels an we answered threes about
that drew them like a hornets nest we met them good an large
the english at the double an the irish at the charge


there was a row in silver street an i was in it too
we passed the time o day an then the belts went whirraru
i misremember what occurred but subsequint the storm
a freemans journal supplemint was all my uniform


there was a row in silver street they sent the polis there
the english were too drunk to know the irish didnt care
but when they grew impertinint we simultaneous rose
till half o them was liffey mud an half was tatthered clothes


there was a row in silver street it might ha raged till now
but some one drew his sidearm clear an nobody knew how
twas hogan took the point an dropped we saw the red blood run
an so we all was murderers that started out in fun


there was a row in silver street but that put down the shine
wid each man whisperin to his next twas never work o mine
we went away like beaten dogs an down the street we bore him
the poor dumb corpse that couldnt tell the bhoys were sorry for him


there was a row in silver street it isnt over yet
for half of us are under guard wid punishments to get
tis all a merricle to me as in the clink i lie
there was a row in silver street begod i wonder why


by the old moulmein pagoda lookin eastward to the sea
theres a burma girl asettin and i know she thinks o me
for the wind is in the palmtrees and the templebells they say
come you back you british soldier come you back to mandalay


her petticoat was yaller an her little cap was green
an her name was supiyawlat jes the same as theebaws queen
an i seed her first asmokin of a whackin white cheroot
an awastin christian kisses on an heathen idols foot


when the mist was on the ricefields an the sun was droppin slow
shed git her little banjo an shed sing kullalolo
with her arm upon my shoulder an her cheek agin my cheek
we useter watch the steamers an the hathis pilin teak


but thats all shove behind me long ago an fur away
an there aint no busses runnin from the bank to mandalay
an im learnin here in london what the tenyear soldier tells
if youve heard the east acallin you wont never heed naught else


i am sick o wastin leather on these gritty pavinstones
an the blasted henglish drizzle wakes the fever in my bones
tho i walks with fifty housemaids outer chelsea to the strand
an they talks a lot o lovin but wot do they understand


ship me somewheres east of suez where the best is like the worst
where there arent no ten commandments an a man can raise a thirst
for the templebells are callin an its there that i would be
by the old moulmein pagoda looking lazy at the sea


to the legion of the lost ones to the cohort of the damned
to my brethren in their sorrow overseas
sings a gentleman of england cleanly bred machinely crammed
and a trooper of the empress if you please
yea a trooper of the forces who has run his own six horses
and faith he went the pace and went it blind
and the world was more than kin while he held the ready tin
but today the sergeants something less than kind


oh its sweet to sweat through stables sweet to empty kitchen slops
and its sweet to hear the tales the troopers tell
to dance with blowzy housemaids at the regimental hops
and thrash the cad who says you waltz too well
yes it makes you cockahoop to be rider to your troop
and branded with a blasted worsted spur
when you envy o how keenly one poor tommy being cleanly
who blacks your boots and sometimes calls you sir


if the home we never write to and the oaths we never keep
and all we know most distant and most dear
across the snoring barrackroom return to break our sleep
can you blame us if we soak ourselves in beer
when the drunken comrade mutters and the great guardlantern gutters
and the horror of our fall is written plain
every secret selfrevealing on the aching whitewashed ceiling
do you wonder that we drug ourselves from pain


we have done with hope and honour we are lost to love and truth
we are dropping down the ladder rung by rung
and the measure of our torment is the measure of our youth
god help us for we knew the worst too young
our shame is clean repentance for the crime that brought the sentence
our pride it is to know no spur of pride
and the curse of reuben holds us till an alien turf enfolds us
and we die and none can tell them where we died


oh theres them injian temples to admire when you see
theres the peacock round the corner an the monkey up the tree
an theres that rummy silver grass awavin in the wind
an the old grand trunk atrailin like a riflesling behind


at halfpast fives revelly an our tents they down must come
like a lot of button mushrooms when you pick em up at home
but its over in a minute an at six the column starts
while the women and the kiddies sit an shiver in the carts


oh then its open order an we lights our pipes an sings
an we talks about our rations an a lot of other things
an we thinks o friends in england an we wonders what theyre at
an how they would admire for to hear us sling the bat


its none so bad o sunday when youre lyin at your ease
to watch the kites awheelin round them featherheaded trees
for although there aint no women yet there aint no barrickyards
so the orficers goes shootin an the men they plays at cards


so hark an heed you rookies which is always grumblin sore
theres worser things than marchin from umballa to cawnpore
an if your heels are blistered an they feels to hurt like hell
you drop some tallow in your socks an that will make hem well


were marchin on relief over injias coral strand
eight hundred fightin englishmen the colonel and the band
ho get away you bullockman youve heard the bugle blowed
theres a regiment acomin down the grand trunk road


oh east is east and west is west and never the twain shall meet
till earth and sky stand presently at gods great judgment seat
but there is neither east nor west border nor breed nor birth
when two strong men stand face to face tho they come from the ends of the earth


kamal is out with twenty men to raise the borderside
and he has lifted the colonels mare that is the colonels pride
he has lifted her out of the stabledoor between the dawn and the day
and turned the calkins upon her feet and ridden her far away
then up and spoke the colonels son that led a troop of the guides
is there never a man of all my men can say where kamal hides
then up and spoke mahommed khan the son of the ressaldar
if ye know the track of the morningmist ye know where his pickets are
at dusk he harries the abazai at dawn he is into bonair
but he must go by fort bukloh to his own place to fare
so if ye gallop to fort bukloh as fast as a bird can fly
by the favour of god ye may cut him off ere he win to the tongue of jagai
but if he be past the tongue of jagai right swiftly turn ye then
for the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with kamals men
there is rock to the left and rock to the right and low lean thorn between
and ye may hear a breechbolt snick where never a man is seen
the colonels son has taken a horse and a raw rough dun was he
with the mouth of a bell and the heart of hell and the head of the gallowstree


the colonels son to the fort has won they bid him stay to eat
who rides at the tail of a border thief he sits not long at his meat
hes up and away from fort bukloh as fast as he can fly
till he was aware of his fathers mare in the gut of the tongue of jagai
till he was aware of his fathers mare with kamal upon her back
and when he could spy the white of her eye he made the pistol crack
he has fired once he has fired twice but the whistling ball went wide
ye shoot like a soldier kamal said show now if ye can ride
its up and over the tongue of jagai as blown dustdevils go
the dun he fled like a stag of ten but the mare like a barren doe
the dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above
but the red mare played with the snafflebars as a maiden plays with a glove
there was rock to the left and rock to the right and low lean thorn between
and thrice he heard a breechbolt snick tho never a man was seen
they have ridden the low moon out of the sky their hoofs drum up the dawn
the dun he went like a wounded bull but the mare like a newroused fawn
the dun he fell at a watercourse in a woful heap fell he
and kamal has turned the red mare back and pulled the rider free


he has knocked the pistol out of his hand small room was there to strive
twas only by favour of mine quoth he ye rode so long alive
there was not a rock for twenty mile there was not a clump of tree
but covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee
if i had raised my bridlehand as i have held it low
the little jackals that flee so fast were feasting all in a row
if i had bowed my head on my breast as i have held it high
the kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly
lightly answered the colonels son do good to bird and beast
but count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast
if there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away
belike the price of a jackals meal were more than a thief could pay
they will feed their horse on the standing crop their men on the garnered grain
the thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are slain
but if thou thinkest the price be fair thy brethren wait to sup
the hound is kin to the jackalspawn howl dog and call them up
and if thou thinkest the price be high in steer and gear and stack
give me my fathers mare again and ill fight my own way back
kamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet
no talk shall be of dogs said he when wolf and gray wolf meet
may i eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath
what dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with death
lightly answered the colonels son i hold by the blood of my clan
take up the mare for my fathers gift by god she has carried a man
the red mare ran to the colonels son and nuzzled against his breast
we be two strong men said kamal then but she loveth the younger best
so she shall go with a lifters dower my turquoisestudded rein
my broidered saddle and saddlecloth and silver stirrups twain


the colonels son a pistol drew and held it muzzleend
ye have taken the one from a foe said he will ye take the mate from a friend
a gift for a gift said kamal straight a limb for the risk of a limb
thy father has sent his son to me ill send my son to him
with that he whistled his only son that dropped from a mountaincrest
he trod the ling like a buck in spring and he looked like a lance in rest
now here is thy master kamal said who leads a troop of the guides
and thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides
till death or i cut loose the tie at camp and board and bed
thy life is his thy fate it is to guard him with thy head
so thou must eat the white queens meat and all her foes are thine
and thou must harry thy fathers hold for the peace of the borderline
and thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power
belike they will raise thee to ressaldar when i am hanged in peshawur


they have looked each other between the eyes and there they found no fault
they have taken the oath of the brotherinblood on leavened bread and salt
they have taken the oath of the brotherinblood on fire and freshcut sod
on the hilt and the haft of the khyber knife and the wondrous names of god
the colonels son he rides the mare and kamals boy the dun
and two have come back to fort bukloh where there went forth but one
and when they drew to the quarterguard full twenty swords flew clear
there was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer
ha done ha done said the colonels son put up the steel at your sides
last night ye had struck at a border thief tonight tis a man of the guides


oh east is east and west is west and never the twain shall meet
till earth and sky stand presently at gods great judgment seat
but there is neither east nor west border nor breed nor birth
when two strong men stand face to face tho they come from the ends of the earth


udai chand lay sick to death
in his hold by gungra hill
all night we heard the deathgongs ring
for the soul of the dying rajpoot king
all night beat up from the womens wing
a cry that we could not still


all night the barons came and went
the lords of the outer guard
all night the cressets glimmered pale
on ulwar sabre and tonk jezail
mewar headstall and marwar mail
that clinked in the palace yard


in the golden room on the palace roof
all night he fought for air
and there was sobbing behind the screen
rustle and whisper of women unseen
and the hungry eyes of the boondi queen
on the death she might not share


he passed at dawn the deathfire leaped
from ridge to riverhead
from the malwa plains to the abu scars
and wail upon wail went up to the stars
behind the grim zenanabars
when they knew that the king was dead


the dumb priest knelt to tie his mouth
and robe him for the pyre
the boondi queen beneath us cried
see now that we die as our mothers died
in the bridalbed by our masters side
out women to the fire


we drove the great gates home apace
white hands were on the sill
but ere the rush of the unseen feet
had reached the turn to the open street
the bars shot down the guarddrum beat
we held the dovecot still


a face looked down in the gathering day
and laughing spoke from the wall
ohe they mourn here let me by
azizun the lucknow nautchgirl i
when the house is rotten the rats must fly
and i seek another thrall


for i ruled the king as neer did queen
tonight the queens rule me
guard them safely but let me go
or ever they pay the debt they owe
in scourge and torture she leaped below
and the grim guard watched her flee


they knew that the king had spent his soul
on a northbred dancinggirl
that he prayed to a flatnosed lucknow god
and kissed the ground where her feet had trod
and doomed to death at her drunken nod
and swore by her lightest curl


we bore the king to his fathers place
where the tombs of the sunborn stand
where the gray apes swing and the peacocks preen
on fretted pillar and jewelled screen
and the wild boar couch in the house of the queen
on the drift of the desert sand


the herald read his titles forth
we set the logs aglow
friend of the english free from fear
baron of luni to jeysulmeer
lord of the desert of bikaneer
king of the jungle go


all night the red flame stabbed the sky
with wavering windtossed spears
and out of a shattered temple crept
a woman who veiled her head and wept
and called on the king but the great king slept
and turned not for her tears


small thought had he to mark the strife
cold fear with hot desire
when thrice she leaped from the leaping flame
and thrice she beat her breast for shame
and thrice like a wounded dove she came
and moaned about the fire


one watched a bowshot from the blaze
the silent streets between
who had stood by the king in sport and fray
to blade in ambush or boar at bay
and he was a baron old and gray
and kin to the boondi queen


he said o shameless put aside
the veil upon thy brow
who held the king and all his land
to the wanton will of a harlots hand
will the white ash rise from the blistered brand
stoop down and call him now


then she by the faith of my tarnished soul
all things i did not well
i had hoped to clear ere the fire died
and lay me down by my masters side
to rule in heaven his only bride
while the others howl in hell


but i have felt the fires breath
and hard it is to die
yet if i may pray a rajpoot lord
to sully the steel of a thakurs sword
with baseborn blood of a trade abhorred
and the thakur answered ay


he drew and struck the straight blade drank
the life beneath the breast
i had looked for the queen to face the flame
but the harlot dies for the rajpoot dame
sister of mine pass free from shame
pass with thy king to rest


the black log crashed above the white
the little flames and lean
red as slaughter and blue as steel
that whistled and fluttered from head to heel
leaped up anew for they found their meal
on the heart of the boondi queen


before the old peshawur gate where kurd and kaffir meet
the governor of kabul dealt the justice of the street
and that was strait as running noose and swift as plunging knife
tho he who held the longer purse might hold the longer life


there was a hound of hindustan had struck a euzufzai
wherefore they spat upon his face and led him out to die
it chanced the king went forth that hour when throat was bared to knife
the kaffir grovelled underhoof and clamoured for his life


then said the king have hope o friend yea death disgraced is hard
much honour shall be thine and called the captain of the guard
yar khan a bastard of the blood so citybabble saith
and he was honoured of the king the which is salt to death
and he was son of daoud shah the reiver of the plains
and blood of old durani lords ran fire in his veins
and twas to tame an afghan pride nor hell nor heaven could bind
the king would make him butcher to a yelping cur of hind


strike said the king kings blood art thou his death shall be his pride
then louder that the crowd might catch fear not his arms are tied
yar khan drew clear the khyber knife and struck and sheathed again
o man thy will is done quoth he a king this dog hath slain


abdhur rahman the durani chief to the north and the south is sold
the north and the south shall open their mouth to a ghilzai flag unrolled
when the big guns speak to the khyber peak and his dogheratis fly
ye have heard the song how long how long wolves of the abazai


that night before the watch was set when all the streets were clear
the governor of kabul spoke my king hast thou no fear
thou knowest thou hast heard his speech died at his masters face
and grimly said the afghan king i rule the afghan race
my path is mine see thou to thine tonight upon thy bed
think who there be in kabul now that clamour for thy head


that night when all the gates were shut to city and to throne
within a little gardenhouse the king lay down alone
before the sinking of the moon which is the night of night
yar khan came softly to the king to make his honour white
the children of the town had mocked beneath his horses hoofs
the harlots of the town had hailed him butcher from their roofs
but as he groped against the wall two hands upon him fell
the king behind his shoulder spake dead man thou dost not well
tis ill to jest with kings by day and seek a boon by night
and that thou bearest in thy hand is all too sharp to write
but three days hence if god be good and if thy strength remain
thou shalt demand one boon of me and bless me in thy pain
for i am merciful to all and most of all to thee
my butcher of the shambles rest no knife hast thou for me


abdhur rahman the durani chief holds hard by the south and the north
but the ghilzai knows ere the melting snows when the swollen banks break forth
when the redcoats crawl to the sungar wall and his usbeg lances fail
ye have heard the song how long how long wolves of the zuka kheyl


they stoned him in the rubbishfield when dawn was in the sky
according to the written word see that he do not die


they stoned him till the stones were piled above him on the plain
and those the labouring limbs displaced they tumbled back again


one watched beside the dreary mound that veiled the battered thing
and him the king with laughter called the herald of the king


it was upon the second night the night of ramazan
the watcher leaning earthward heard the message of yar khan


from shattered breast through shrivelled lips broke forth the rattling breath
creature of god deliver me from agony of death


they sought the king among his girls and risked their lives thereby
protector of the pitiful give orders that he die


bid him endure until the day a lagging answer came
the night is short and he can pray and learn to bless my name


before the dawn three times he spoke and on the day once more
creature of god deliver me and bless the king therefor


they shot him at the morning prayer to ease him of his pain
and when he heard the matchlocks clink he blessed the king again


which thing the singers made a song for all the world to sing
so that the outer seas may know the mercy of the king


when springtime flushes the desert grass
our kafilas wind through the khyber pass
lean are the camels but fat the frails
light are the purses but heavy the bales
as the snowbound trade of the north comes down
to the marketsquare of peshawur town


in a turquoise twilight crisp and chill
a kafila camped at the foot of the hill
then blue smokehaze of the cooking rose
and tentpeg answered to hammernose
and the picketed ponies shag and wild
strained at their ropes as the feed was piled
and the bubbling camels beside the load
sprawled for a furlong adown the road
and the persian pussycats brought for sale
spat at the dogs from the camelbale
and the tribesmen bellowed to hasten the food
and the campfires twinkled by fort jumrood
and there fled on the wings of the gathering dusk
a savour of camels and carpets and musk
a murmur of voices a reek of smoke
to tell us the trade of the khyber woke


the lid of the fleshpot chattered high
the knives were whetted and then came i


to mahbub ali the muleteer
patching his bridles and counting his gear
crammed with the gossip of half a year


but mahbub ali the kindly said
better is speech when the belly is fed
so we plunged the hand to the midwrist deep
in a cinnamon stew of the fattailed sheep
and he who never hath tasted the food
by allah he knoweth not bad from good


we cleansed our beards of the muttongrease
we lay on the mats and were filled with peace
and the talk slid north and the talk slid south
with the sliding puffs from the hookahmouth
four things greater than all things are
women and horses and power and war
we spake of them all but the last the most
for i sought a word of a russian post
of a shifty promise an unsheathed sword
and a graycoat guard on the helmund ford
then mahbub ali lowered his eyes
in the fashion of one who is weaving lies
quoth he of the russians who can say
when the night is gathering all is gray
but we look that the gloom of the night shall die
in the morning flush of a bloodred sky
friend of my heart is it meet or wise
to warn a king of his enemies
we know what heaven or hell may bring
but no man knoweth the mind of the king
that unsought counsel is cursed of god
attesteth the story of wali dad


his sire was leaky of tongue and pen
his dam was a clucking khuttuck hen
and the colt bred close to the vice of each
for he carried the curse of an unstanched speech
therewith madness so that he sought
the favour of kings at the kabul court
and travelled in hope of honour far
to the line where the graycoat squadrons are
there have i journeyed too but i
saw naught said naught and did not die
he harked to rumour and snatched at a breath
of this one knoweth and that one saith
legends that ran from mouth to mouth
of a graycoat coming and sack of the south
these have i also heard they pass
with each new spring and the winter grass


hotfoot southward forgotten of god
back to the city ran wali dad
even to kabul in full durbar
the king held talk with his chief in war
into the press of the crowd he broke
and what he had heard of the coming spoke


then gholam hyder the red chief smiled
as a mother might on a babbling child
but those who would laugh restrained their breath
when the face of the king showed dark as death
evil it is in full durbar
to cry to a ruler of gathering war
slowly he led to a peachtree small
that grew by a cleft of the city wall
and he said to the boy they shall praise thy zeal
so long as the red spurt follows the steel
and the russ is upon us even now
great is thy prudence await them thou
watch from the tree thou art young and strong
surely thy vigil is not for long
the russ is upon us thy clamour ran
surely an hour shall bring their van
wait and watch when the host is near
shout aloud that my men may hear


friend of my heart is it meet or wise
to warn a king of his enemies
a guard was set that he might not flee
a score of bayonets ringed the tree
the peachbloom fell in showers of snow
when he shook at his death as he looked below
by the power of god who alone is great
till the seventh day he fought with his fate
then madness took him and men declare
he mowed in the branches as ape and bear
and last as a sloth ere his body failed
and he hung as a bat in the forks and wailed
and sleep the cord of his hands untied
and he fell and was caught on the points and died


heart of my heart is it meet or wise
to warn a king of his enemies
we know what heaven or hell may bring
but no man knoweth the mind of the king
of the graycoat coming who can say
when the night is gathering all is gray
two things greater than all things are
the first is love and the second war
and since we know not how war may prove
heart of my heart let us talk of love


the wreath of banquet overnight lay withered on the neck
our hands and scarfs were saffrondyed for signal of despair
when we went forth to paniput to battle with the mlech
ere we came back from paniput and left a kingdom there


thrice thirty thousand men were we to force the jumna fords
the hawkwinged horse of damajee mailed squadrons of the bhao
stark levies of the southern hills the deccans sharpest swords
and he the harlots traitor son the goatherd mulhar rao


thrice thirty thousand men were we before the mists had cleared
the low white mists of morning heard the warconch scream and bray
we called upon bhowani and we gripped them by the beard
we rolled upon them like a flood and washed their ranks away


the children of the hills of khost before our lances ran
we drove the black rohillas back as cattle to the pen
twas then we needed mulhar rao to end what we began
a thousand men had saved the charge he fled the field with ten


there was no room to clear a sword no power to strike a blow
for foot to foot ay breast to breast the battle held us fast
save where the naked hillmen ran and stabbing from below
brought down the horse and rider and we trampled them and passed


to left the roar of musketry rang like a falling flood
to right the sunshine rippled red from redder lance and blade
above the dark upsaras flew beneath us plashed the blood
and bellying black against the dust the bhagwa jhanda swayed


i saw it fall in smoke and fire the banner of the bhao
i heard a voice across the press of one who called in vain
ho anand rao nimbalkhur ride get aid of mulhar rao
go shame his squadrons into fight the bhao the bhao is slain


thereat as when a sandbar breaks in clotted spume and spray
when rain of later autumn sweeps the jumna waterhead
before their charge from flank to flank our riven ranks gave way
but of the waters of that flood the jumna fords ran red


i held by scindia my lord as close as man might hold
a soobah of the deccan asks no aid to guard his life
but holkars horse were flying and our chiefest chiefs were cold
and like a flame among us leapt the long lean northern knife


i held by scindia my lance from butt to tuft was dyed
the froth of battle bossed the shield and roped the bridlechain
what time beneath our horses feet a maiden rose and cried
and clung to scindia and i turned a swordcut from the twain


he set a spell upon the maid in woodlands long ago
a hunter by the tapti banks she gave him water there
he turned her heart to water and she followed to her woe
what need had he of lalun who had twenty maids as fair


now in that hour strength left my lord he wrenched his mare aside
he bound the girl behind him and we slashed and struggled free
across the reeling wreck of strife we rode as shadows ride
from paniput to delhi town but not alone were we


twas lutufullah populzai laid horse upon our track
a swinefed reiver of the north that lusted for the maid
i might have barred his path awhile but scindia called me back
and i o woe for scindia i listened and obeyed


league after league the formless scrub took shape and glided by
league after league the white road swirled behind the white mares feet
league after league when leagues were done we heard the populzai
where sure as time and swift as death the tireless footfall beat


noons eye beheld that shame of flight the shadows fell we fled
where steadfast as the wheeling kite he followed in our train
the black wolf warred where we had warred the jackal mocked our dead
and terror born of twilighttide made mad the labouring brain


i gasped a kingdom waits my lord her love is but her own
a day shall mar a day shall cure for her but what for thee
cut loose the girl he follows fast cut loose and ride alone
then scindia twixt his blistered lips my queens queen shall she be


of all who ate my bread last night twas she alone that came
to seek her love between the spears and find her crown therein
one shame is mine today what need the weight of double shame
if once we reach the delhi gate though all be lost i win


we rode the white mare failed her trot a staggering stumble grew
the cookingsmoke of even rose and weltered and hung low
and still we heard the populzai and still we strained anew
and delhi town was very near but nearer was the foe


yea delhi town was very near when lalun whispered slay
lord of my life the mare sinks fast stab deep and let me die
but scindia would not and the maid tore free and flung away
and turning as she fell we heard the clattering populzai


then scindia checked the gasping mare that rocked and groaned for breath
and wheeled to charge and plunged the knife a handsbreadth in her side
the hunter and the hunted know how that last pause is death
the blood had chilled about her heart she reared and fell and died


our gods were kind before he heard the maidens piteous scream
a log upon the delhi road beneath the mare he lay
lost mistress and lost battle passed before him like a dream
the darkness closed about his eyes i bore my king away


boh da thone was a warrior bold
his sword and his snider were bossed with gold


and the peacock banner his henchmen bore
was stiff with bullion but stiffer with gore


he shot at the strong and he slashed at the weak
from the salween scrub to the chindwin teak


he crucified noble he sacrificed mean
he filled old ladies with kerosene


while over the water the papers cried
the patriot fights for his countryside


but little they cared for the native press
the worn white soldiers in khaki dress


who tramped through the jungle and camped in the byre
who died in the swamp and were tombed in the mire


who gave up their lives at the queens command
for the pride of their race and the peace of the land


now first of the foemen of boh da thone
was captain oneil of the black tyrone


and his was a company seventy strong
who hustled that dissolute chief along


there were lads from galway and louth and meath
who went to their death with a joke in their teeth


and worshipped with fluency fervour and zeal
the mud on the bootheels of crook oneil


but ever a blight on their labours lay
and ever their quarry would vanish away


till the sundried boys of the black tyrone
took a brotherly interest in boh da thone


and sooth if pursuit in possession ends
the boh and his trackers were best of friends


the word of a scout a march by night
a rush through the mist a scattering fight


a volley from cover a corpse in the clearing
the glimpse of a loincloth and heavy jade earring


the flare of a village the tally of slain
and the boh was abroad on the raid again


they cursed their luck as the irish will
they gave him credit for cunning and skill


they buried their dead they bolted their beef
and started anew on the track of the thief


till in place of the kalends of greece men said
when crook and his darlings come back with the head


they had hunted the boh from the hills to the plain
he doubled and broke for the hills again


they had crippled his power for rapine and raid
they had routed him out of his pet stockade


and at last they came when the day star tired
to a camp deserted a village fired


a black cross blistered the morninggold
and the body upon it was stark and cold


the wind of the dawn went merrily past
the high grass bowed her plumes to the blast


and out of the grass on a sudden broke
a spirtle of fire a whorl of smoke


and captain oneil of the black tyrone
was blessed with a slug in the ulnarbone
the gift of his enemy boh da thone


now a slug that is hammered from telegraphwire
is a thorn in the flesh and a rankling fire


the shotwound festered as shotwounds may
in a steaming barrack at mandalay


the left arm throbbed and the captain swore
id like to be after the boh once more


the fever held him the captain said
id give a hundred to look at his head


the hospital punkahs creaked and whirred
but babu harendra gomashta heard


he thought of the canebrake green and dank
that girdled his home by the dacca tank


he thought of his wife and his high school son
he thought but abandoned the thought of a gun


his sleep was broken by visions dread
of a shining boh with a silver head


he kept his counsel and went his way
and swindled the cartmen of half their pay


and the months went on as the worst must do
and the boh returned to the raid anew


but the captain had quitted the longdrawn strife
and in far simoorie had taken a wife


and she was a damsel of delicate mould
with hair like the sunshine and heart of gold


and little she knew the arms that embraced
had cloven a man from the brow to the waist


and little she knew that the loving lips
had ordered a quivering lifes eclipse


and the eye that lit at her lightest breath
had glared unawed in the gates of death


for these be matters a man would hide
as a general rule from an innocent bride


and little the captain thought of the past
and of all men babu harendra last


but slow in the sludge of the kathun road
the government bullock train toted its load


speckless and spotless and shining with ghee
in the rearmost cart sat the babujee


and ever a phantom before him fled
of a scowling boh with a silver head


then the leadcart stuck though the coolies slaved
and the cartmen flogged and the escort raved


and out of the jungle with yells and squeals
pranced boh da thone and his gang at his heels


then belching blunderbuss answered back
the sniders snarl and the carbines crack


and the blithe revolver began to sing
to the blade that twanged on the lockingring


and the brown flesh blued where the baynet kissed
as the steel shot back with a wrench and a twist


and the great white bullocks with onyx eyes
watched the souls of the dead arise


and over the smoke of the fusillade
the peacock banner staggered and swayed


oh gayest of scrimmages man may see
is a wellworked rush on the gbt


the babu shook at the horrible sight
and girded his ponderous loins for flight


but fate had ordained that the boh should start
on a lonehand raid of the rearmost cart


and out of that cart with a bellow of woe
the babu fell flat on the top of the boh


for years had harendra served the state
to the growth of his purse and the girth of his pet


there were twenty stone as the tallyman knows
on the broad of the chest of this best of bohs


and twenty stone from a height discharged
are bad for a boh with a spleen enlarged


oh short was the struggle severe was the shock
he dropped like a bullock he lay like a block


and the babu above him convulsed with fear
heard the labouring lifebreath hissed out in his ear


and thus in a fashion undignified
the princely pest of the chindwin died


turn now to simoorie where lapped in his ease
the captain is petting the bride on his knees


where the whit of the bullet the wounded mans scream
are mixed as the mist of some devilish dream


forgotten forgotten the sweat of the shambles
where the hilldaisy blooms and the gray monkey gambols


from the swordbelt set free and released from the steel
the peace of the lord is with captain oneil


up the hill to simoorie most patient of drudges
the bags on his shoulder the mailrunner trudges


for captain oneil sahib one hundred and ten
rupees to collect on delivery then


their breakfast was stopped while the screwjack and hammer
tore waxcloth split teakwood and chipped out the dammer


openeyed openmouthed on the naperys snow
with a crash and a thud rolled the head of the boh


and gummed to the scalp was a letter which ran
in fielding force service encampment th jan


dear sir i have honour to send as you said
for final approval see under bohs head


was took by myself in most bloody affair
by high education brought pressure to bear


now violate liberty time being bad
to mail vpp rupees hundred please add


whatever your honour can pass price of blood
much cheap at one hundred and children want food


so trusting your honour will somewhat retain
true love and affection for govt bullock train


as the rabbit is drawn to the rattlesnakes power
as the smokers eye fills at the opium hour


as a horse reaches up to the manger above
as the waiting ear yearns for the whisper of love


from the arms of the bride ironvisaged and slow
the captain bent down to the head of the boh


and een as he looked on the thing where it lay
twixt the winking new spoons and the napkins array


the freed mind fled back to the longago days
the handtohand scuffle the smoke and the blaze


the forced march at night and the quick rush at dawn
the banjo at twilight the burial ere morn


the stench of the marshes the raw piercing smell
when the overhand stabbingcut silenced the yell


the oaths of his irish that surged when they stood
where the black crosses hung oer the kuttamow flood


as a derelict ship drifts away with the tide
the captain went out on the past from his bride


back back through the springs to the chill of the year
when he hunted the boh from maloon to tsaleer


as the shape of a corpse dimmers up through deep water
in his eye lit the passionless passion of slaughter


and men who had fought with oneil for the life
had gazed on his face with less dread than his wife


for she who had held him so long could not hold him
though a fourmonth eternity should have controlled him


but watched the twin terror the head turned to head
the scowling scarred black and the flushed savage red


the spirit that changed from her knowing and flew to
some grim hidden past she had never a clue to


but it knew as it grinned for he touched it unfearing
and muttered aloud so you kept that jade earring


then nodded and kindly as friend nods to friend
old man you fought well but you lost in the end


the visions departed and shame followed passion
he took what i said in this horrible fashion


ill write to harendra with language unsainted
the captain came back to the bride who had fainted


and this is a fiction no go to simoorie
and look at their baby a twelvemonth old houri


a pert little irisheyed kathleen mavournin
shes always about on the mall of a mornin


and youll see if her right shoulderstrap is displaced
this gules upon argent a bohs head erased


o woe is me for the merry life
i led beyond the bar
and a treble woe for my winsome wife
that weeps at shalimar


they have taken away my long jezail
my shield and sabre fine
and heaved me into the central jail
for lifting of the kine


the steer may low within the byre
the jat may tend his grain
but therell be neither loot nor fire
till i come back again


and god have mercy on the jat
when once my fetters fall
and heaven defend the farmers hut
when i am loosed from thrall


its woe to bend the stubborn back
above the grinching quern
its woe to hear the legbar clack
and jingle when i turn


but for the sorrow and the shame
the brand on me and mine
ill pay you back in leaping flame
and loss of the butchered kine


for every cow i spared before
in charity set free
if i may reach my hold once more
ill reive an honest three


for every time i raised the low
that scared the dusty plain
by sword and cord by torch and tow
ill light the land with twain


ride hard ride hard to abazai
young sahib with the yellow hair
lie close lie close as khuttucks lie
fat herds below bonair


the one ill shoot at twilighttide
at dawn ill drive the other
the black shall mourn for hoof and hide
the white man for his brother


tis war red war ill give you then
war till my sinews fail
for the wrong you have done to a chief of men
and a thief of the zukka kheyl


and if i fall to your hand afresh
i give you leave for the sin
that you cram my throat with the foul pigs flesh
and swing me in the skin


at the close of a winter day
their anchors down by london town the three great captains lay
and one was admiral of the north from solway firth to skye
and one was lord of the wessex coast and all the lands thereby
and one was master of the thames from limehouse to blackwall
and he was captain of the fleet the bravest of them all
their good guns guarded their great gray sides that were thirty foot in the sheer
when there came a certain tradingbrig with news of a privateer
her rigging was rough with the clotted drift that drives in a northern breeze
her sides were clogged with the lazy weed that spawns in the eastern seas
light she rode in the rude tiderip to left and right she rolled
and the skipper sat on the scuttlebutt and stared at an empty hold
i ha paid port dues for your law quoth he and where is the law ye boast
if i sail unscathed from a heathen port to be robbed on a christian coast
ye have smoked the hives of the laccadives as we burn the lice in a bunk
we tack not now to a gallang prow or a plunging peiho junk
i had no fear but the seas were clear as far as a sail might fare
till i met with a limewashed yankee brig that rode off finisterre
there were canvas blinds to his bowgun ports to screen the weight he bore
and the signals ran for a merchantman from sandy hook to the nore
he would not fly the rovers flag the bloody or the black
but now he floated the gridiron and now he flaunted the jack


he spoke of the law as he crimped my crew he swore it was only a loan
but when i would ask for my own again he swore it was none of my own
he has taken my little parrakeets that nest beneath the line
he has stripped my rails of the shaddockfrails and the green unripened pine
he has taken my bale of dammer and spice i won beyond the seas
he has taken my grinning heathen gods and what should he want o these
my foremast would not mend his boom my deckhouse patch his boats
he has whittled the two this yank yahoo to peddle for shoepeg oats
i could not fight for the failing light and a rough beamsea beside
but i hulled him once for a clumsy crimp and twice because he lied
had i had guns as i had goods to work my christian harm
i had run him up from his quarterdeck to trade with his own yardarm


i had nailed his ears to my capstanhead and ripped them off with a saw
and soused them in the bilgewater and served them to him raw
i had flung him blind in a rudderless boat to rot in the rocking dark
i had towed him aft of his own craft a bait for his brother shark
i had lapped him round with cocoa husk and drenched him with the oil
and lashed him fast to his own mast to blaze above my spoil
i had stripped his hide for my hammockside and tasselled his beard i the mesh
and spitted his crew on the live bamboo that grows through the gangrened flesh
i had hove him down by the mangroves brown where the mudreef sucks and draws
moored by the heel to his own keel to wait for the landcrabs claws
he is lazar within and lime without ye can nose him far enow
for he carries the taint of a musky ship the reek of the slavers dhow


the skipper looked at the tiering guns and the bulwarks tall and cold
and the captains three full courteously peered down at the gutted hold
and the captains three called courteously from deck to scuttlebutt
good sir we ha dealt with that merchantman or ever your teeth were cut
your words be words of a lawless race and the law it standeth thus
he comes of a race that have never a law and he never has boarded us
we ha sold him canvas and rope and spar we know that his price is fair
and we know that he weeps for the lack of a law as he rides off finisterre
and since he is damned for a gallowsthief by you and better than you
we hold it meet that the english fleet should know that we hold him true
the skipper called to the tall taffrail and what is that to me
did ever you hear of a yankee brig that rifled a seventythree


do i loom so large from your quarterdeck that i lift like a ship o the line
he has learned to run from a shotted gun and harry such craft as mine
there is never a law on the cocos keys to hold a white man in
but we do not steal the niggers meal for that is a niggers sin
must he have his law as a quid to chaw or laid in brass on his wheel
does he steal with tears when he buccaneers fore gad then why does he steal
the skipper bit on a deepsea word and the word it was not sweet
for he could see the captains three had signalled to the fleet


but three and two in white and blue the whimpering flags began
we have heard a tale of a foreign sail but he is a merchantman
the skipper peered beneath his palm and swore by the great horn spoon
fore gad the chaplain of the fleet would bless my picaroon
by two and three the flags blew free to lash the laughing air
we have sold our spars to the merchantman we know that his price is fair
the skipper winked his western eye and swore by a china storm
they ha rigged him a josephs jurycoat to keep his honour warm
the halliards twanged against the tops the bunting bellied broad
the skipper spat in the empty hold and mourned for a wasted cord


masthead masthead the signal sped by the line o the british craft
the skipper called to his lascar crew and put her about and laughed
its mainsail haul my bully boys all well out to the seas again
ere they set us to paint their pirate saint or scrub at his grapnelchain
its foresheet free with her head to the sea and the swing of the unbought brine
well make no sport in an english court till we come as a ship o the line


till we come as a ship o the line my lads of thirty foot in the sheer
lifting again from the outer main with news of a privateer
flying his pluck at our mizzentruck for weft of admiralty
heaving his head for our dipseylead in sign that we keep the sea
then foresheet home as she lifts to the foam we stand on the outward tack
we are paid in the coin of the white mans trade the bezant is hard ay and black
the frigatebird shall carry my word to the kling and the oranglaut
how a man may sail from a heathen coast to be robbed in a christian port
how a man may be robbed in christian port while three great captains there
shall dip their flag to a slavers rag to show that his trade is fair


it was our warship clampherdown
would sweep the channel clean
wherefore she kept her hatches close
when the merry channel chops arose
to save the bleached marine


she had one bowgun of a hundred ton
and a great sterngun beside
they dipped their noses deep in the sea
they racked their stays and stanchions free
in the wash of the windwhipped tide


it was our warship clampherdown
fell in with a cruiser light
that carried the dainty hotchkiss gun
and a pair o heels wherewith to run
from the grip of a closefought fight


she opened fire at seven miles
as ye shoot at a bobbing cork
and once she fired and twice she fired
till the bowgun drooped like a lily tired
that lolls upon the stalk


captain the bowgun melts apace
the deckbeams break below
twere well to rest for an hour or twain
and botch the shattered plates again
and he answered make it so


she opened fire within the mile
as ye shoot at the flying duck
and the great sterngun shot fair and true
with the heave of the ship to the stainless blue
and the great sternturret stuck


captain the turret fills with steam
the feedpipes burst below
you can hear the hiss of the helpless ram
you can hear the twisted runners jam
and he answered turn and go


it was our warship clampherdown
and grimly did she roll
swung round to take the cruisers fire
as the white whale faces the threshers ire
when they war by the frozen pole


captain the shells are falling fast
and faster still fall we
and it is not meet for english stock
to bide in the heart of an eightday clock
the death they cannot see


lie down lie down my bold ab
we drift upon her beam
we dare not ram for she can run
and dare ye fire another gun
and die in the peeling steam


it was our warship clampherdown
that carried an armourbelt
but fifty feet at stern and bow
lay bare as the paunch of the pursers sow
to the hail of the nordenfeldt


captain they hack us through and through
the chilled steel bolts are swift
we have emptied the bunkers in open sea
their shrapnel bursts where our coal should be
and he answered let her drift


it was our warship clampherdown
swung round upon the tide
her two dumb guns glared south and north
and the blood and the bubbling steam ran forth
and she ground the cruisers side


captain they cry the fight is done
they bid you send your sword
and he answered grapple her stern and bow
they have asked for the steel they shall have it now
out cutlasses and board


it was our warship clampherdown
spewed up four hundred men
and the scalded stokers yelped delight
as they rolled in the waist and heard the fight
stamp oer their steelwalled pen


they cleared the cruiser end to end
from conningtower to hold
they fought as they fought in nelsons fleet
they were stripped to the waist they were bare to the feet
as it was in the days of old


it was the sinking clampherdown
heaved up her battered side
and carried a million pounds in steel
to the cod and the corpsefed congereel
and the scour of the channel tide


it was the crew of the clampherdown
stood out to sweep the sea
on a cruiser won from an ancient foe
as it was in the days of long ago
and as it still shall be


seven men from all the world back to docks again
rolling down the ratcliffe road drunk and raising cain
give the girls another drink fore we sign away
we that took the bolivar out across the bay


we put out from sunderland loaded down with rails
we put back to sunderland cause our cargo shifted
we put out from sunderland met the winter gales
seven days and seven nights to the start we drifted


racketing her rivets loose smokestack white as snow
all the coals adrift adeck half the rails below
leaking like a lobsterpot steering like a dray
out we took the bolivar out across the bay


one by one the lights came up winked and let us by
mile by mile we waddled on coal and focsle short
met a blow that laid us down heard a bulkhead fly
left the wolf behind us with a twofoot list to port


trailing like a wounded duck working out her soul
clanging like a smithyshop after every roll
just a funnel and a mast lurching through the spray
so we threshed the bolivar out across the bay


felt her hog and felt her sag betted when shed break
wondered every time she raced if shed stand the shock
heard the seas like drunken men pounding at her strake
hoped the lord hud keep his thumb on the plummerblock


banged against the iron decks bilges choked with coal
flayed and frozen foot and hand sick of heart and soul
last we prayed shed buck herself into judgment day
hi we cursed the bolivar knocking round the bay


o her nose flung up to sky groaning to be still
up and down and back we went never time for breath
then the money paid at lloyds caught her by the heel
and the stars ran round and round dancin at our death


aching for an hours sleep dozing off between
heard the rotten rivets draw when she took it green
watched the compass chase its tail like a cat at play
that was on the bolivar south across the bay


once we saw between the squalls lyin head to swell
mad with work and weariness wishin they was we
some damned liners lights go by like a long hotel
cheered her from the bolivar swampin in the sea


then a grayback cleared us out then the skipper laughed
boys the wheel has gone to hell rig the winches aft
yoke the kicking rudderhead get her under way
so we steered her pulleyhaul out across the bay


just a pack o rotten plates puttied up with tar
in we came an time enough cross bilbao bar
overloaded undermanned meant to founder we
euchred god almightys storm bluffed the eternal sea


seven men from all the world back to town again
rollin down the ratcliffe road drunk and raising cain
seven men from out of hell aint the owners gay
cause we took the bolivar safe across the bay


love and death once ceased their strife
at the tavern of mans life
called for wine and threw alas
each his quiver on the grass
when the bout was oer they found
mingled arrows strewed the ground
hastily they gathered then
each the loves and lives of men
ah the fateful dawn deceived
mingled arrows each one sheaved
deaths dread armoury was stored
with the shafts he most abhorred
loves light quiver groaned beneath
venomheaded darts of death


thus it was they wrought our woe
at the tavern long ago
tell me do our masters know
loosing blindly as they fly
old men love while young men die


the dead child lay in the shroud
and the widow watched beside
and her mother slept and the channel swept
the gale in the teeth of the tide


but the mother laughed at all
i have lost my man in the sea
and the child is dead be still she said
what more can ye do to me


the widow watched the dead
and the candle guttered low
and she tried to sing the passing song
that bids the poor soul go


and mary take you now she sang
that lay against my heart
and mary smooth your crib tonight
but she could not say depart


then came a cry from the sea
but the searime blinded the glass
and heard ye nothing mother she said
tis the child that waits to pass


and the nodding mother sighed
tis a lambing ewe in the whin
for why should the christened soul cry out
that never knew of sin


o feet i have held in my hand
o hands at my heart to catch
how should they know the road to go
and how should they lift the latch


they laid a sheet to the door
with the little quilt atop
that it might not hurt from the cold or the dirt
but the crying would not stop


the widow lifted the latch
and strained her eyes to see
and opened the door on the bitter shore
to let the soul go free


there was neither glimmer nor ghost
there was neither spirit nor spark
and heard ye nothing mother she said
tis crying for me in the dark


and the nodding mother sighed
tis sorrow makes ye dull
have ye yet to learn the cry of the tern
or the wail of the windblown gull


the terns are blown inland
the gray gull follows the plough
twas never a bird the voice i heard
o mother i hear it now


lie still dear lamb lie still
the child is passed from harm
tis the ache in your breast that broke your rest
and the feel of an empty arm


she put her mother aside
in marys name let be
for the peace of my soul i must go she said
and she went to the calling sea


in the heel of the windbit pier
where the twisted weed was piled
she came to the life she had missed by an hour
for she came to a little child


she laid it into her breast
and back to her mother she came
but it would not feed and it would not heed
though she gave it her own childs name


and the dead child dripped on her breast
and her own in the shroud lay stark
and god forgive us mother she said
we let it die in the dark


when the flush of a newborn sun fell first on edens green and gold
our father adam sat under the tree and scratched with a stick in the mould
and the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to his mighty heart
till the devil whispered behind the leaves its pretty but is it art


wherefore he called to his wife and fled to fashion his work anew
the first of his race who cared a fig for the first most dread review
and he left his lore to the use of his sons and that was a glorious gain
when the devil chuckled is it art in the ear of the branded cain


they fought and they talked in the north and the souththey talked and they fought in the west
till the waters rose on the pitiful land and the poor red clay had rest
had rest till that dank blankcanvas dawn when the dove was preened to start
and the devil bubbled below the keel its human but is it art


they builded a tower to shiver the sky and wrench the stars apart
till the devil grunted behind the bricks its striking but is it art
the stone was dropped at the quarryside and the idle derrick swung
while each man talked of the aims of art and each in an alien tongue


the tale is as old as the eden tree and new as the newcut tooth
for each man knows ere his lipthatch grows he is master of art and truth
and each man hears as the twilight nears to the beat of his dying heart
the devil drum on the darkened pane you did it but was it art


we have learned to whittle the eden tree to the shape of a surplicepeg
we have learned to bottle our parents twain in the yelk of an addled egg
we know that the tail must wag the dog for the horse is drawn by the cart
but the devil whoops as he whooped of old its clever but is it art


when the flicker of london sun falls faint on the clubrooms green and gold
the sons of adam sit them down and scratch with their pens in the mould
they scratch with their pens in the mould of their graves and the ink and the anguish start
for the devil mutters behind the leaves its pretty but is it art


now if we could win to the eden tree where the four great rivers flow
and the wreath of eve is red on the turf as she left it long ago
and if we could come when the sentry slept and softly scurry through
by the favour of god we might know as much as our father adam knew


this is the sorrowful story
told when the twilight fails
and the monkeys walk together
holding their neighbours tails


our fathers lived in the forest
foolish people were they
they went down to the cornland
to teach the farmers to play


our fathers frisked in the millet
our fathers skipped in the wheat
our fathers hung from the branches
our fathers danced in the street


then came the terrible farmers
nothing of play they knew
only they caught our fathers
and set them to labour too


set them to work in the cornland
with ploughs and sickles and flails
put them in mudwalled prisons
and cut off their beautiful tails


now we can watch our fathers
sullen and bowed and old
stooping over the millet
sharing the silly mould


driving a foolish furrow
mending a muddy yoke
sleeping in mudwalled prisons
steeping their food in smoke


we may not speak to our fathers
for if the farmers knew
they would come up to the forest
and set us to labour too


this is the horrible story
told as the twilight fails
and the monkeys walk together
holding their kinsmens tails


twas when the rain fell steady an the ark was pitched an ready
that noah got his orders for to take the bastes below
he dragged them all together by the horn an hide an feather
an all excipt the donkey was agreeable to go


thin noah spoke him fairly thin talked to him sevarely
an thin he cursed him squarely to the glory av the lord
divil take the ass that bred you and the greater ass that fed you
divil go wid you ye spalpeen an the donkey went aboard


but the wind was always failin an twas most onaisy sailin
an the ladies in the cabin couldnt stand the stable air
an the bastes betwuxt the hatches they tuk an died in batches
till noah said theres wan av us that hasnt paid his fare


for he heard a flusteration mid the bastes av all creation
the trumpetin av elephints an bellowin av whales
an he saw forninst the windy whin he wint to stop the shindy
the divil wid a stablefork bedivillin their tails


the divil cursed outrageous but noah said umbrageous
to what am i indebted for this tenantright invasion
an the divil gave for answer evict me if you can sir
for i came in wid the donkey on your honours invitation


winds of the world give answer they are whimpering to and fro
and what should they know of england who only england know
the poor little streetbred people that vapour and fume and brag
they are lifting their heads in the stillness to yelp at the english flag


must we borrow a clout from the boer to plaster anew with dirt
an irish liars bandage or an english cowards shirt
we may not speak of england her flags to sell or share
what is the flag of england winds of the world declare


the north wind blew from bergen my steelshod vanguards go
i chase your lazy whalers home from the disko floe
by the great north lights above me i work the will of god
and the liner splits on the icefield or the dogger fills with cod


i barred my gates with iron i shuttered my doors with flame
because to force my ramparts your nutshell navies came
i took the sun from their presence i cut them down with my blast
and they died but the flag of england blew free ere the spirit passed


the lean white bear hath seen it in the long long arctic night
the muskox knows the standard that flouts the northern light
what is the flag of england ye have but my bergs to dare
ye have but my drifts to conquer go forth for it is there


the south wind sighed from the virgins my midsea course was taen
over a thousand islands lost in an idle main
where the seaegg flames on the coral and the longbacked breakers croon
their endless ocean legends to the lazy locked lagoon


strayed amid lonely islets mazed amid outer keys
i waked the palms to laughter i tossed the scud in the breeze
never was isle so little never was sea so lone
but over the scud and the palmtrees an english flag was flown


i have wrenched it free from the halliard to hang for a wisp on the horn
i have chased it north to the lizard ribboned and rolled and torn
i have spread its fold oer the dying adrift in a hopeless sea
i have hurled it swift on the slaver and seen the slave set free


my basking sunfish know it and wheeling albatross
where the lone wave fills with fire beneath the southern cross
what is the flag of england ye have but my reefs to dare
ye have but my seas to furrow go forth for it is there


the east wind roared from the kuriles the bitter seas i come
and me men call the homewind for i bring the english home
look look well to your shipping by the breath of my mad typhoon
i swept your closepacked praya and beached your best at kowloon


the reeling junks behind me and the racing seas before
i raped your richest roadstead i plundered singapore
i set my hand on the hoogli as a hooded snake she rose
and i flung your stoutest steamers to roost with the startled crows


never the lotus closes never the wildfowl wake
but a soul goes out on the east wind that died for englands sake
man or woman or suckling mother or bride or maid
because on the bones of the english the english flag is stayed


the desertdust hath dimmed it the flying wildass knows
the scared white leopard winds it across the taintless snows
what is the flag of england ye have but my sun to dare
ye have but my sands to travel go forth for it is there


the west wind called in squadrons the thoughtless galleons fly
that bear the wheat and cattle lest streetbred people die
they make my might their porter they make my house their path
till i loose my neck from their rudder and whelm them all in my wrath


i draw the gliding fogbank as a snake is drawn from the hole
they bellow one to the other the frighted shipbells toll
for day is a drifting terror till i raise the shroud with my breath
and they see strange bows above them and the two go locked to death


but whether in calm or wrackwreath whether by dark or day
i heave them whole to the conger or rip their plates away
first of the scattered legions under a shrieking sky
dipping between the rollers the english flag goes by


the dead dumb fog hath wrapped it the frozen dews have kissed
the naked stars have seen it a fellowstar in the mist
what is the flag of england ye have but my breath to dare
ye have but my waves to conquer go forth for it is there


help for a patriot distressed a spotless spirit hurt
help for an honourable clan sore trampled in the dirt
from queenstown bay to donegal o listen to my song
the honourable gentlemen have suffered grievous wrong


their noble names were mentioned o the burning black disgrace
by a brutal saxon paper in an irish shootingcase
they sat upon it for a year then steeled their heart to brave it
and coruscating innocence the learned judges gave it


bear witness heaven of that grim crime beneath the surgeons knife
the honourable gentlemen deplored the loss of life
bear witness of those chanting choirs that burk and shirk and snigger
no man laid hand upon the knife or finger to the trigger


cleared in the face of all mankind beneath the winking skies
like phoenixes from phoenix park and what lay there they rise
go shout it to the emerald seas give word to erin now
her honourable gentlemen are cleared and this is how


they only paid the moonlighter his cattlehocking price
they only helped the murderer with counsels best advice
but sure it keeps their honour white the learned court believes
they never gave a piece of plate to murderers and thieves


they never told the ramping crowd to card a womans hide
they never marked a man for death what fault of theirs he died
they only said intimidate and talked and went away
by god the boys that did the work were braver men than they


their sin it was that fed the fire small blame to them that heard
the bhoys get drunk on rhetoric and madden at a word
they knew whom they were talking at if they were irish too
the gentlemen that lied in court they knew and well they knew


they only took the judasgold from fenians out of jail
they only fawned for dollars on the blooddyed clannagael
if black is black or white is white in black and white its down
theyre only traitors to the queen and rebels to the crown


cleared honourable gentlemen be thankful its no more
the widows curse is on your house the dead are at your door
on you the shame of open shame on you from north to south
the hand of every honest man flatheeled across your mouth


less black than we were painted faith no word of black was said
the lightest touch was human blood and that you know runs red
its sticking to your fist today for all your sneer and scoff
and by the judges wellweighed word you cannot wipe it off


hold up those hands of innocence go scare your sheep together
the blundering tripping tups that bleat behind the old bellwether
and if they snuff the taint and break to find another pen
tell them its tar that glistens so and daub them yours again


the charge is old as old as cain as fresh as yesterday
old as the ten commandments have ye talked those laws away
if words are words or death is death or powder sends the ball
you spoke the words that sped the shot the curse be on you all


our friends believe of course they do as sheltered women may
but have they seen the shrieking soul ripped from the quivering clay
they if their own front door is shut theyll swear the whole worlds warm
what do they know of dread of death or hanging fear of harm


the secret half a county keeps the whisper in the lane
the shriek that tells the shot went home behind the broken pane
the dry blood crisping in the sun that scares the honest bees
and shows the bhoys have heard your talk what do they know of these


but you you know ay ten times more the secrets of the dead
black terror on the countryside by word and whisper bred
the mangled stallions scream at night the tailcropped heifers low
who set the whisper going first you know and well you know


my soul id sooner lie in jail for murder plain and straight
pure crime id done with my own hand for money lust or hate
than take a seat in parliament by fellowfelons cheered
while one of those not provens proved me cleared as you are cleared


cleared you that lost the league accounts go guard our honour still
go help to make our countrys laws that broke gods law at will
one hand stuck out behind the back to signal strike again
the other on your dressshirtfront to show your heart is clane


if black is black or white is white in black and white its down
youre only traitors to the queen and rebels to the crown
if print is print or words are words the learned court perpends
we are not ruled by murderers but only by their friends


now this is the tale of the council the german kaiser decreed
to ease the strong of their burden to help the weak in their need
he sent a word to the peoples who struggle and pant and sweat
that the straw might be counted fairly and the tally of bricks be set


the lords of their hands assembled from the east and the west they drew
baltimore lille and essen brummagem clyde and crewe
and some were black from the furnace and some were brown from the soil
and some were blue from the dyevat but all were wearied of toil


and the young king said i have found it the road to the rest ye seek
the strong shall wait for the weary the hale shall halt for the weak
with the even tramp of an army where no man breaks from the line
ye shall march to peace and plenty in the bond of brotherhood sign


the paper lay on the table the strong heads bowed thereby
and a wail went up from the peoples ay sign give rest for we die
a hand was stretched to the goosequill a fist was cramped to scrawl
when the laugh of a blueeyed maiden ran clear through the councilhall


and each one heard her laughing as each one saw her plain
saidie mimi or olga gretchen or mary jane
and the spirit of man that is in him to the light of the vision woke
and the men drew back from the paper as a yankee delegate spoke


theres a girl in jersey city who works on the telephone
were going to hitch our horses and dig for a house of our own
with gas and water connections and steamheat through to the top
and w hohenzollern i guess i shall work till i drop


and an english delegate thundered the weak an the lame be blowed
ive a berth in the souwest workshops a home in the wandsworth road
and till the sociation has footed my buryin bill
i work for the kids an the missus pull up i be damned if i will


and over the german benches the bearded whisper ran
lager der girls und der dollars dey makes or dey breaks a man
if schmitt haf collared der dollars he collars der girl deremit
but if schmitt bust in der pizness we collars der girl from schmitt


they passed one resolution your subcommittee believe
you can lighten the curse of adam when youve lightened the curse of eve
but till we are built like angels with hammer and chisel and pen
we will work for ourself and a woman for ever and ever amen


now this is the tale of the council the german kaiser held
the day that they razored the grindstone the day that the cat was belled
the day of the figs from thistles the day of the twisted sands
the day that the laugh of a maiden made light of the lords of their hands


now tomlinson gave up the ghost in his house in berkeley square
and a spirit came to his bedside and gripped him by the hair
a spirit gripped him by the hair and carried him far away
till he heard as the roar of a rainfed ford the roar of the milky way
till he heard the roar of the milky way die down and drone and cease
and they came to the gate within the wall where peter holds the keys
stand up stand up now tomlinson and answer loud and high
the good that ye did for the sake of men or ever ye came to die
the good that ye did for the sake of men in little earth so lone
and the naked soul of tomlinson grew white as a rainwashed bone
o i have a friend on earth he said that was my priest and guide
and well would he answer all for me if he were by my side
for that ye strove in neighbourlove it shall be written fair
but now ye wait at heavens gate and not in berkeley square


though we called your friend from his bed this night he could not speak for you
for the race is run by one and one and never by two and two
then tomlinson looked up and down and little gain was there
for the naked stars grinned overhead and he saw that his soul was bare
the wind that blows between the worlds it cut him like a knife
and tomlinson took up his tale and spoke of his good in life
this i have read in a book he said and that was told to me
and this i have thought that another man thought of a prince in muscovy
the good souls flocked like homing doves and bade him clear the path
and peter twirled the jangling keys in weariness and wrath


ye have read ye have heard ye have thought he said and the tale is yet to run
by the worth of the body that once ye had give answer what ha ye done
then tomlinson looked back and forth and little good it bore
for the darkness stayed at his shoulderblade and heavens gate before
o this i have felt and this i have guessed and this i have heard men say
and this they wrote that another man wrote of a carl in norroway


ye have read ye have felt ye have guessed good lack ye have hampered heavens gate
theres little room between the stars in idleness to prate
o none may reach by hired speech of neighbour priest and kin
through borrowed deed to gods good meed that lies so fair within
get hence get hence to the lord of wrong for doom has yet to run
and the faith that ye share with berkeley square uphold you tomlinson


the spirit gripped him by the hair and sun by sun they fell
till they came to the belt of naughty stars that rim the mouth of hell
the first are red with pride and wrath the next are white with pain
but the third are black with clinkered sin that cannot burn again
they may hold their path they may leave their path with never a soul to mark
they may burn or freeze but they must not cease in the scorn of the outer dark
the wind that blows between the worlds it nipped him to the bone
and he yearned to the flare of hellgate there as the light of his own hearthstone


the devil he sat behind the bars where the desperate legions drew
but he caught the hasting tomlinson and would not let him through
wot ye the price of good pitcoal that i must pay said he
that ye rank yoursel so fit for hell and ask no leave of me
i am all oersib to adams breed that ye should give me scorn
for i strove with god for your first father the day that he was born
sit down sit down upon the slag and answer loud and high
the harm that ye did to the sons of men or ever you came to die
and tomlinson looked up and up and saw against the night
the belly of a tortured star bloodred in hellmouth light
and tomlinson looked down and down and saw beneath his feet
the frontlet of a tortured star milkwhite in hellmouth heat
o i had a love on earth said he that kissed me to my fall
and if ye would call my love to me i know she would answer all


all that ye did in love forbid it shall be written fair
but now ye wait at hellmouth gate and not in berkeley square
though we whistled your love from her bed tonight i trow she would not run
for the sin ye do by two and two ye must pay for one by one
the wind that blows between the worlds it cut him like a knife
and tomlinson took up the tale and spoke of his sin in life
once i ha laughed at the power of love and twice at the grip of the grave
and thrice i ha patted my god on the head that men might call me brave
the devil he blew on a brandered soul and set it aside to cool
do ye think i would waste my good pitcoal on the hide of a brainsick fool


i see no worth in the hobnailed mirth or the jolthead jest ye did
that i should waken my gentlemen that are sleeping three on a grid
then tomlinson looked back and forth and there was little grace
for hellgate filled the houseless soul with the fear of naked space
nay this i ha heard quo tomlinson and this was noised abroad
and this i ha got from a belgian book on the word of a dead french lord
ye ha heard ye ha read ye ha got good lack and the tale begins afresh
have ye sinned one sin for the pride o the eye or the sinful lust of the flesh
then tomlinson he gripped the bars and yammered let me in
for i mind that i borrowed my neighbours wife to sin the deadly sin
the devil he grinned behind the bars and banked the fires high
did ye read of that sin in a book said he and tomlinson said ay
the devil he blew upon his nails and the little devils ran
and he said go husk this whimpering thief that comes in the guise of a man
winnow him out twixt star and star and sieve his proper worth
theres sore decline in adams line if this be spawn of earth
empusas crew so nakednew they may not face the fire
but weep that they bin too small to sin to the height of their desire


over the coal they chased the soul and racked it all abroad
as children rifle a caddiscase or the ravens foolish hoard
and back they came with the tattered thing as children after play
and they said the soul that he got from god he has bartered clean away
we have threshed a stook of print and book and winnowed a chattering wind
and many a soul wherefrom he stole but his we cannot find
we have handled him we have dandled him we have seared him to the bone
and sure if tooth and nail show truth he has no soul of his own
the devil he bowed his head on his breast and rumbled deep and low
im all oersib to adams breed that i should bid him go
yet close we lie and deep we lie and if i gave him place
my gentlemen that are so proud would flout me to my face


theyd call my house a common stews and me a careless host
and i would not anger my gentlemen for the sake of a shiftless ghost
the devil he looked at the mangled soul that prayed to feel the flame
and he thought of holy charity but he thought of his own good name
now ye could haste my coal to waste and sit ye down to fry
did ye think of that theft for yourself said he and tomlinson said ay
the devil he blew an outward breath for his heart was free from care
ye have scarce the soul of a louse he said but the roots of sin are there


and for that sin should ye come in were i the lord alone
but sinful pride has rule inside and mightier than my own
honour and wit foredamned they sit to each his priest and whore
nay scarce i dare myself go there and you theyd torture sore
ye are neither spirit nor spirk he said ye are neither book nor brute
go get ye back to the flesh again for the sake of mans repute
im all oersib to adams breed that i should mock your pain
but look that ye win to worthier sin ere ye come back again


get hence the hearse is at your door the grim black stallions wait
they bear your clay to place today speed lest ye come too late
go back to earth with a lip unsealed go back with an open eye
and carry my word to the sons of men or ever ye come to die
that the sin they do by two and two they must pay for one by one
and the god that you took from a printed book be with you tomlinson


my newcut ashlar takes the light
where crimsonblank the windows flare
by my own work before the night
great overseer i make my prayer


if there be good in that i wrought
thy hand compelled it master thine
where i have failed to meet thy thought
i know through thee the blame is mine


one instants toil to thee denied
stands all eternitys offence
of that i did with thee to guide
to thee through thee be excellence


who lest all thought of eden fade
bringst eden to the craftsmans brain
godlike to muse oer his own trade
and manlike stand with god again


the depth and dream of my desire
the bitter paths wherein i stray
thou knowest who hast made the fire
thou knowest who hast made the clay


one stone the more swings to her place
in that dread temple of thy worth
it is enough that through thy grace
i saw naught common on thy earth


take not that vision from my ken
oh whatsoeer may spoil or speed
help me to need no aid from men
that i may help such men as need


theres a whisper down the field where the year has shot her yield
and the ricks stand gray to the sun
singing over then come over for the bee has quit the clover
and your english summers done
you have heard the beat of the offshore wind
and the thresh of the deepsea rain
you have heard the song how long how long
pull out on the trail again


ha done with the tents of shem dear lass
weve seen the seasons through
and its time to turn on the old trail our own trail the out trail
pull out pull out on the long trail the trail that is always new


its north you may run to the rimeringed sun
or south to the blind horns hate
or east all the way into mississippi bay
or west to the golden gate
where the blindest bluffs hold good dear lass
and the wildest tales are true
and the men bulk big on the old trail our own trail the out trail
and life runs large on the long trail the trail that is always new


the days are sick and cold and the skies are gray and old
and the twicebreathed airs blow damp
and id sell my tired soul for the bucking beamsea roll
of a black bilbao tramp
with her loadline over her hatch dear lass
and a drunken dago crew
and her nose held down on the old trail our own trail the out trail
from cadiz bar on the long trail the trail that is always new


there be triple ways to take of the eagle or the snake
or the way of a man with a maid
but the fairest way to me is a ships upon the sea
in the heel of the northeast trade
can you hear the crash on her bows dear lass
and the drum of the racing screw
as she ships it green on the old trail our own trail the out trail
as she lifts and scends on the long trail the trail that is always new


see the shaking funnels roar with the peter at the fore
and the fenders grind and heave
and the derricks clack and grate as the tackle hooks the crate
and the fallrope whines through the sheave
its gangplank up and in dear lass
its hawsers warp her through
and its all clear aft on the old trail our own trail the out trail
were backing down on the long trail the trail that is always new


o the mutter overside when the portfog holds us tied
and the sirens hoot their dread
when foot by foot we creep oer the hueless viewless deep
to the sob of the questing lead
its down by the lower hope dear lass
with the gunfleet sands in view
till the mouse swings green on the old trail our own trail the out trail
and the gull light lifts on the long trail the trail that is always new


o the blazing tropic night when the wakes a welt of light
that holds the hot sky tame
and the steady forefoot snores through the planetpowdered floors
where the scared whale flukes in flame
her plates are scarred by the sun dear lass
and her ropes are taut with the dew
for were booming down on the old trail our own trail the out trail
were sagging south on the long trail the trail that is always new


then home get her home where the drunken rollers comb
and the shouting seas drive by
and the engines stamp and ring and the wet bows reel and swing
and the southern cross rides high
yes the old lost stars wheel back dear lass
that blaze in the velvet blue
theyre all old friends on the old trail our own trail the out trail
theyre gods own guides on the long trail the trail that is always new


fly forward o my heart from the foreland to the start
were steaming alltoo slow
and its twenty thousand mile to our little lazy isle
where the trumpetorchids blow
you have heard the call of the offshore wind
and the voice of the deepsea rain
you have heard the song how long how long
pull out on the trail again


the lord knows what we may find dear lass
and the deuce knows what we may do
but were back once more on the old trail our own trail the out trail
were down hull down on the long trail the trail that is always new


the cities are full of pride
challenging each to each
this from her mountainside
that from her burthened beach


they count their ships full tale
their corn and oil and wine
derrick and loom and bale
and ramparts gunflecked line
city by city they hail
hast aught to match with mine


and the men that breed from them
they traffic up and down
but cling to their cities hem
as a child to their mothers gown


when they talk with the stranger bands
dazed and newly alone
when they walk in the stranger lands
by roaring streets unknown
blessing her where she stands
for strength above their own


on high to hold her fame
that stands all fame beyond
by oath to back the same
most faithfulfoolishfond
making her merebreathed name
their bond upon their bond


so thank i god my birth
fell not in isles aside
waste headlands of the earth
or warring tribes untried
but that she lent me worth
and gave me right to pride


surely in toil or fray
under an alien sky
comfort it is to say
of no mean city am i


neither by service nor fee
come i to mine estate
mother of cities to me
for i was born in her gate
between the palms and the sea
where the worldend steamers wait


now for this debt i owe
and for her farborne cheer
must i make haste and go
with tribute to her pier


and she shall touch and remit
after the use of kings
orderly ancient fit
my deepsea plunderings
and purchase in all lands
and this we do for a sign
her power is over mine
and mine i hold at her hands


fair is our lot o goodly is our heritage
humble ye my people and be fearful in your mirth
for the lord our god most high
he hath made the deep as dry
he hath smote for us a pathway to the ends of all the earth


yea though we sinned and our rulers went from righteousness
deep in all dishonour though we stained our garments hem
oh be ye not dismayed
though we stumbled and we strayed
we were led by evil counsellors the lord shall deal with them


hold ye the faith the faith our fathers sealed us
whoring not with visions overwise and overstale
except ye pay the lord
single heart and single sword
of your children in their bondage shall he ask them trebletale


keep ye the law be swift in all obedience
clear the land of evil drive the road and bridge the ford
make ye sure to each his own
that he reap where he hath sown
by the peace among our peoples let men know we serve the lord


hear now a song a song of broken interludes
a song of little cunning of a singer nothing worth
through the naked words and mean
may ye see the truth between
as the singer knew and touched it in the ends of all the earth


our brows are bound with spindrift and the weed is on our knees
our loins are battered neath us by the swinging smoking seas
from reef and rock and skerry over headland ness and voe
the coastwise lights of england watch the ships of england go


through the endless summer evenings on the lineless level floors
through the yelling channel tempest when the siren hoots and roars
by day the dipping houseflag and by night the rockets trail
as the sheep that graze behind us so we know them where they hail


we bridge across the dark and bid the helmsman have a care
the flash that wheeling inland wakes his sleeping wife to prayer
from our vexed eyries head to gale we bind in burning chains
the lover from the searim drawn his love in english lanes


we greet the clippers wingandwing that race the southern wool
we warn the crawling cargotanks of bremen leith and hull
to each and all our equal lamp at peril of the sea
the white wallsided warships or the whalers of dundee


come up come in from eastward from the guardports of the morn
beat up beat in from southerly o gipsies of the horn
swift shuttles of an empires loom that weave us main to main
the coastwise lights of england give you welcome back again


go get you gone upchannel with the seacrust on your plates
go get you into london with the burden of your freights
haste for they talk of empire there and say if any seek
the lights of england sent you and by silence shall ye speak


hear now the song of the dead in the north by the torn bergedges
they that look still to the pole asleep by their hidestripped sledges
song of the dead in the south in the sun by their skeleton horses
where the warrigal whimpers and bays through the dust
of the sear rivercourses


we were dreamers dreaming greatly in the manstifled town
we yearned beyond the skyline where the strange roads go down
came the whisper came the vision came the power with the need
till the soul that is not mans soul was lent us to lead
as the deer breaks as the steer breaks from the herd where they graze
in the faith of little children we went on our ways
then the wood failed then the food failed then the last water dried
in the faith of little children we lay down and died
on the sanddrift on the veldtside in the fernscrub we lay
that our sons might follow after by the bones on the way
follow after follow after we have watered the root
and the bud has come to blossom that ripens for fruit
follow after we are waiting by the trails that we lost
for the sounds of many footsteps for the tread of a host
follow after follow after for the harvest is sown
by the bones about the wayside ye shall come to your own


when drake went down to the horn
and england was crowned thereby
twixt seas unsailed and shores unhailed
our lodge our lodge was born
and england was crowned thereby


which never shall close again
by day nor yet by night
while man shall take his life to stake
at risk of shoal or main
by day nor yet by night


but standeth even so
as now we witness here
while men depart of joyful heart
adventure for to know
as now bear witness here


the wrecks dissolve above us their dust drops down from afar
down to the dark to the utter dark where the blind white seasnakes are
there is no sound no echo of sound in the deserts of the deep
or the great gray level plains of ooze where the shellburred cables creep


here in the womb of the world here on the tieribs of earth
words and the words of men flicker and flutter and beat
warning sorrow and gain salutation and mirth
for a power troubles the still that has neither voice nor feet


they have wakened the timeless things they have killed their father time
joining hands in the gloom a league from the last of the sun
hush men talk today oer the waste of the ultimate slime
and a new word runs between whispering let us be one


one from the ends of the earth gifts at an open door
treason has much but we mother thy sons have more
from the whine of a dying man from the snarl of a wolfpack freed
turn and the world is thine mother be proud of thy seed
count are we feeble or few hear is our speech so rude
look are we poor in the land judge are we men of the blood


those that have stayed at thy knees mother go call them in
we that were bred overseas wait and would speak with our kin
not in the dark do we fight haggle and flout and gibe
selling our love for a price loaning our hearts for a bribe
gifts have we only today love without promise or fee
hear for thy children speak from the uttermost parts of the sea


royal and dowerroyal i the queen
fronting thy richest sea with richer hands
a thousand mills roar through me where i glean
all races from all lands


me the seacaptain loved the river built
wealth sought and kings adventured life to hold
hail england i am asia power on silt
death in my hands but gold


clive kissed me on the mouth and eyes and brow
wonderful kisses so that i became
crowned above queens a withered beldame now
brooding on ancient fame


hail mother do they call me rich in trade
little care i but hear the shorn priest drone
and watch my silkclad lovers man by maid
laugh neath my shwe dagon


hail mother east and west must seek my aid
ere the spent gear may dare the ports afar
the second doorway of the wide worlds trade
is mine to loose or bar


hail mother hold me fast my praya sleeps
under innumerable keels today
yet guard and landward or tomorrow sweeps
thy warships down the bay


into the mist my guardian prows put forth
behind the mist my virgin ramparts lie
the warden of the honour of the north
sleepless and veiled am i


peace is our portion yet a whisper rose
foolish and causeless half in jest half hate
now wake we and remember mighty blows
and fearing no man wait


from east to west the circling word has passed
till west is east beside our landlocked blue
from east to west the tested chain holds fast
the wellforged link rings true


hail snatched and bartered oft from hand to hand
i dream my dream by rock and heath and pine
of empire to the northward ay one land
from lions head to line


greeting nor fear nor favour won us place
got between greed of gold and dread of drouth
loudvoiced and reckless as the wild tiderace
that whips our harbourmouth


greeting my birthstain have i turned to good
forcing strong wills perverse to steadfastness
the first flush of the tropics in my blood
and at my feet success


the northern stirp beneath the southern skies
i build a nation for an empires need
suffer a little and my land shall rise
queen over lands indeed


mans love first found me mans hate made me hell
for my babes sake i cleansed those infamies
earnest for leave to live and labour well
god flung me peace and ease


last loneliest loveliest exquisite apart
on us on us the unswerving season smiles
who wonder mid our fern why men depart
to seek the happy isles


truly ye come of the blood slower to bless than to ban
little used to lie down at the bidding of any man
flesh of the flesh that i bred bone of the bone that i bare
stark as your sons shall be stern as your fathers were
deeper than speech our love stronger than life our tether
but we do not fall on the neck nor kiss when we come together
my arm is nothing weak my strength is not gone by
sons i have borne many sons but my dugs are not dry
look i have made ye a place and opened wide the doors
that ye may talk together your barons and councillors
wards of the outer march lords of the lower seas
ay talk to your gray mother that bore you on her knees


that ye may talk together brother to brothers face
thus for the good of your peoples thus for the pride of the race
also we will make promise so long as the blood endures
i shall know that your good is mine ye shall feel that my strength is yours
in the day of armageddon at the last great fight of all
that our house stand together and the pillars do not fall
draw now the threefold knot firm on the ninefold bands
and the law that ye make shall be law after the rule of your lands
this for the waxen heath and that for the wattlebloom
this for the mapleleaf and that for the southern broom


the law that ye make shall be law and i do not press my will
because ye are sons of the blood and call me mother still
now must ye speak to your kinsmen and they must speak to you
after the use of the english in straightflung words and few
go to your work and be strong halting not in your ways
balking the end halfwon for an instant dole of praise
stand to your work and be wise certain of sword and pen
who are neither children nor gods but men in a world of men


mine was the woman to me darkling i found
haling her dumb from the camp took her and bound
hot rose her tribe on our track ere i had proved
hearing her laugh in the gloom greatly i loved


swift through the forest we ran none stood to guard
few were my people and far then the flood barred
him we call son of the sea sullen and swollen
panting we waited the death stealer and stolen


yet ere they came to my lance laid for the slaughter
lightly she leaped to a log lapped in the water
holding on high and apart skins that arrayed
called she the god of the wind that he should aid


life had the tree at that word praise we the giver
otterlike left he the bank for the full river
far fell their axes behind flashing and ringing
wonder was on me and fear yet she was singing


low lay the land we had left now the blue bound us
even the floor of the gods level around us
whisper there was not nor word shadow nor showing
till the light stirred on the deep glowing and growing


then did he leap to his place flaring from under
he the compeller the sun bared to our wonder
nay not a league from our eyes blinded with gazing
cleared he the gate of the world huge and amazing


this we beheld and we live the pit of the burning
then the god spoke to the tree for our returning
back to the beach of our flight fearless and slowly
back to our slayers went he but we were holy


men that were hot in that hunt women that followed
babes that were promised our bones trembled and wallowed
over the necks of the tribe crouching and fawning
prophet and priestess we came back from the dawning


thus said the lord in the vault above the cherubim
calling to the angels and the souls in their degree
lo earth has passed away
on the smoke of judgment day
that our word may be established shall we gather up the sea


loud sang the souls of the jolly jolly mariners
plague upon the hurricane that made us furl and flee
but the war is done between us
in the deep the lord hath seen us
our bones well leave the barracout and god may sink the sea


then said the soul of judas that betrayed him
lord hast thou forgotten thy covenant with me
how once a year i go
to cool me on the floe
and ye take my day of mercy if ye take away the sea


then said the soul of the angel of the offshore wind
he that bits the thunder when the bullmouthed breakers flee
i have watch and ward to keep
oer thy wonders on the deep
and ye take mine honour from me if ye take away the sea


loud sang the souls of the jolly jolly mariners
nay but we were angry and a hasty folk are we
if we worked the ship together
till she foundered in foul weather
are we babes that we should clamour for a vengeance on the sea


then said the souls of the slaves that men threw overboard
kennelled in the picaroon a weary band were we
but thy arm was strong to save
and it touched us on the wave
and we drowsed the long tides idle till thy trumpets tore the sea


then cried the soul of the stout apostle paul to god
once we frapped a ship and she laboured woundily
there were fourteen score of these
and they blessed thee on their knees
when they learned thy grace and glory under malta by the sea


loud sang the souls of the jolly jolly mariners
plucking at their harps and they plucked unhandily
our thumbs are rough and tarred
and the tune is something hard
may we lift a deepsea chantey such as seamen use at sea


then said the souls of the gentlemenadventurers
fettered wrist to bar all for red iniquity
ho we revel in our chains
oer the sorrow that was spains
heave or sink it leave or drink it we were masters of the sea


up spake the soul of a gray gothavn speckshioner
he that led the flinching in the fleets of fair dundee
oh the iceblink white and near
and the bowhead breaching clear
will ye whelm them all for wantonness that wallow in the sea


loud sang the souls of the jolly jolly mariners
crying under heaven here is neither lead nor lee
must we sing for evermore
on the windless glassy floor
take back your golden fiddles and well beat to open sea


then stooped the lord and he called the good sea up to him
and stablished his borders unto all eternity
that such as have no pleasure
for to praise the lord by measure
they may enter into galleons and serve him on the sea


sun wind and cloud shall fail not from the face of it
stinging ringing spindrift nor the fulmar flying free
and the ships shall go abroad
to the glory of the lord
who heard the silly sailorfolk and gave them back their sea


king solomon drew merchantmen
because of his desire
for peacocks apes and ivory
from tarshish unto tyre
with cedars out of lebanon
which hiram rafted down
but we be only sailormen
that use in london town


coastwise crossseas round the world and back again
where the flaw shall head us or the full trade suits
plainsail stormsail lay your board and tack again
and thats the way well pay paddy doyle for his boots


we bring no store of ingots
of spice or precious stones
but that we have we gathered
with sweat and aching bones
in flame beneath the tropics
in frost upon the floe
and jeopardy of every wind
that does between them go


and some we got by purchase
and some we had by trade
and some we found by courtesy
of pike and carronade
at midnight midsea meetings
for charity to keep
and light the rolling homewardbound
that rode a foot too deep


by sport of bitter weather
were walty strained and scarred
from the kentledge on the kelson
to the slings upon the yard
six oceans had their will of us
to carry all away
our galleys in the baltic
and our booms in mossel bay


weve floundered off the texel
awash with sodden deals
weve slipped from valparaiso
with the norther at our heels
weve ratched beyond the crossets
that tusk the southern pole
and dipped our gunnels under
to the dread agulhas roll


beyond all outer charting
we sailed where none have sailed
and saw the landlights burning
on islands none have hailed
our hair stood up for wonder
but when the night was done
there danced the deep to windward
blueempty neath the sun


strange consorts rode beside us
and brought us evil luck
the witchfire climbed our channels
and flared on vane and truck
till through the red tornado
that lashed us nigh to blind
we saw the dutchman plunging
full canvas head to wind


weve heard the midnight leadsman
that calls the black deep down
ay thrice weve heard the swimmer
the thing that may not drown
on frozen bunt and gasket
the sleetcloud drave her hosts
when manned by more than signed with us
we passed the isle o ghosts


and north amid the hummocks
a biscuittoss below
we met the silent shallop
that frighted whalers know
for down a cruel icelane
that opened as he sped
we saw dead henry hudson
steer north by west his dead


so dealt gods waters with us
beneath the roaring skies
so walked his signs and marvels
all naked to our eyes
but we were heading homeward
with trade to lose or make
good lord they slipped behind us
in the tailing of our wake


let go let go the anchors
now shamed at heart are we
to bring so poor a cargo home
that had for gift the sea
let go the great bowanchors
ah fools were we and blind
the worst we stored with utter toil
the best we left behind


coastwise crossseas round the world and back again
whither flaw shall fail us or the trades drive down
plainsail stormsail lay your board and tack again
and all to bring a cargo up to london town


i sent a message to my dear
a thousand leagues and more to her
the dumb sealevels thrilled to hear
and lost atlantis bore to her


behind my message hard i came
and nigh had found a grave for me
but that i launched of steel and flame
did war against the wave for me


uprose the deep by gale on gale
to bid me change my mind again
he broke his teeth along my rail
and roaring swung behind again


i stayed the sun at noon to tell
my way across the waste of it
i read the storm before it fell
and made the better haste of it


afar i hailed the land at night
the towers i built had heard of me
and ere my rocket reached its height
had flashed my love the word of me


earth sold her chosen men of strength
they lived and strove and died for me
to drive my road a nations length
and toss the miles aside for me


i snatched their toil to serve my needs
too slow their fleetest flew for me
i tired twenty smoking steeds
and bade them bait a new for me


i sent the lightnings forth to see
where hour by hour she waited me
among ten million one was she
and surely all men hated me


dawn ran to meet me at my goal
ah day no tongue shall tell again
and little folk of little soul
rose up to buy and sell again


weve drunk to the queen god bless her
weve drunk to our mothers land
weve drunk to our english brother
but he does not understand
weve drunk to the wide creation
and the cross swings low for the morn
last toast and of obligation
a health to the nativeborn


they change their skies above them
but not their hearts that roam
we learned from our wistful mothers
to call old england home
we read of the english skylark
of the spring in the english lanes
but we screamed with the painted lories
as we rode on the dusty plains


they passed with their oldworld legends
their tales of wrong and dearth
our fathers held by purchase
but we by the right of birth
our hearts where they rocked our cradle
our love where we spent our toil
and our faith and our hope and our honour
we pledge to our native soil


i charge you charge your glasses
i charge you drink with me
to the men of the four new nations
and the islands of the sea
to the last least lump of coral
that none may stand outside
and our own good pride shall teach us
to praise our comrades pride


to the hush of the breathless morning
on the thin tin crackling roofs
to the haze of the burned backranges
and the dust of the shoeless hoofs
to the risk of a death by drowning
to the risk of a death by drouth
to the men of a million acres
to the sons of the golden south


to the sons of the golden south stand up
and the life we live and know
let a fellow sing o the little things he cares about
if a fellow fights for the little things he cares about
with the weight of a single blow


to the smoke of a hundred coasters
to the sheep on a thousand hills
to the sun that never blisters
to the rain that never chills
to the land of the waiting springtime
to our fivemeal meatfed men
to the tall deepbosomed women
and the children nine and ten


and the children nine and ten stand up
and the life we live and know
let a fellow sing o the little things he cares about
if a fellow fights for the little things he cares about
with the weight of a twofold blow


to the farflung fenceless prairie
where the quick cloudshadows trail
to our neighbours barn in the offing
and the line of the newcut rail
to the plough in her leaguelong furrow
with the gray lake gulls behind
to the weight of a halfyears winter
and the warm wet western wind


to the home of the floods and thunder
to her pale dry healing blue
to the lift of the great cape combers
and the smell of the baked karroo
to the growl of the sluicing stamphead
to the reef and the watergold
to the last and the largest empire
to the map that is half unrolled


to our dear dark fostermothers
to the heathen songs they sung
to the heathen speech we babbled
ere we came to the white mans tongue
to the cool of our deep verandas
to the blaze of our jewelled main
to the night to the palms in the moonlight
and the firefly in the cane


to the hearth of our peoples people
to her wellploughed windy sea
to the hush of our dread highaltar
where the abbey makes us we
to the grist of the slowground ages
to the gain that is yours and mine
to the bank of the open credit
to the powerhouse of the line


weve drunk to the queen god bless her
weve drunk to our mothers land
weve drunk to our english brother
and we hope hell understand
weve drunk as much as were able
and the cross swings low for the morn
last toast and your foot on the table
a health to the nativeborn


a health to the nativeborn
were six white men arow
all bound to sing o the little things we care about
all bound to fight for the little things we care about
with the weight of a sixfold blow
by the might of our cabletow
from the orkneys to the horn
all round the world and a little loop to pull it by
all round the world and a little strap to buckle it
a health to the nativeborn


farewell romance the cavemen said
with bone well carved he went away
flint arms the ignoble arrowhead
and jasper tips the spear today
changed are the gods of hunt and dance
and he with these farewell romance


farewell romance the lakefolk sighed
we lift the weight of flatling years
the caverns of the mountainside
hold him who scorns our hutted piers
lost hills whereby we dare not dwell
guard ye his rest romance farewell


farewell romance the soldier spoke
by sleight of sword we may not win
but scuffle mid uncleanly smoke
of arquebus and culverin
honour is lost and none may tell
who paid good blows romance farewell


farewell romance the traders cried
our keels ha lain with every sea
the dullreturning wind and tide
heave up the wharf where we would be
the known and noted breezes swell
our trudging sail romance farewell


goodbye romance the skipper said
he vanished with the coal we burn
our dial marks full steam ahead
our speed is timed to half a turn
sure as the ferried barge we ply
twixt port and port romance goodbye


romance the seasontickets mourn
he never ran to catch his train
but passed with coach and guard and horn
and left the local late again
confound romance and all unseen
romance brought up the ninefifteen


his hand was on the lever laid
his oilcan soothed the worrying cranks
his whistle waked the snowbound grade
his foghorn cut the reeking banks
by dock and deep and mine and mill
the boygod reckless laboured still


robed crowned and throned he wove his spell
where heartblood beat or hearthsmoke curled
with unconsidered miracle
hedged in a backwardgazing world
then taught his chosen bard to say
our king was with us yesterday


now this is the law of the muscovite that he proves with shot and steel
when ye come by his isles in the smoky sea ye must not take the seal
where the gray sea goes nakedly between the weedhung shelves
and the little blue fox he is bred for his skin and the seal they breed for themselves
for when the matkas seek the shore to drop their pups aland
the great manseal haul out of the sea aroaring band by band
and when the first september gales have slaked their ruttingwrath
the great manseal haul back to the sea and no man knows their path
then dark they lie and stark they lie rookery dune and floe
and the northern lights come down o nights to dance with the houseless snow
and god who clears the grounding berg and steers the grinding floe
he hears the cry of the little kitfox and the wind along the snow
but since our women must walk gay and money buys their gear
the sealingboats they filch that way at hazard year by year
english they be and japanee that hang on the brown bears flank
and some be scot but the worst of the lot and the boldest thieves be yank


it was the sealer northern light to the smoky seas she bore
with a stovepipe stuck from a starboard port and the russian flag at her fore
baltic stralsund and northern light oh they were birds of a feather
slipping away to the smoky seas three sealthieves together
and at last she came to a sandy cove and the baltic lay therein
but her men were up with the herding seal to drive and club and skin
there were fifteen hundred skins abeach cool pelt and proper fur
when the northern light drove into the bight and the seamist drove with her
the baltic called her men and weighed she could not choose but run
for a stovepipe seen through the closing mist it shows like a fourinch gun


and loss it is that is sad as death to lose both trip and ship
and lie for a rotting contraband on vladivostock slip
she turned and dived in the seasmother as a rabbit dives in the whins
and the northern light sent up her boats to steal the stolen skins
they had not brought a load to side or slid their hatches clear
when they were aware of a sloopofwar ghostwhite and very near
her flag she showed and her guns she showed three of them black abeam
and a funnel white with the crusted salt but never a show of steam


there was no time to man the brakes they knocked the shackle free
and the northern light stood out again goosewinged to open sea
for life it is that is worse than death by force of russian law
to work in the mines of mercury that loose the teeth in your jaw
they had not run a mile from shore they heard no shots behind
when the skipper smote his hand on his thigh and threw her up in the wind
bluffed raised out on a bluff said he for if my names tom hall
you must set a thief to catch a thief and a thief has caught us all
by every butt in oregon and every spar in maine
the hand that spilled the wind from her sail was the hand of reuben paine
he has rigged and trigged her with paint and spar and faith he has faked her well
but id know the stralsunds deckhouse yet from here to the booms o hell


oh once we ha met at baltimore and twice on boston pier
but the sickest day for you reuben paine was the day that you came here
the day that you came here my lad to scare us from our seal
with your funnel made o your painted cloth and your guns o rotten deal
ring and blow for the baltic now and head her back to the bay
and well come into the game again with a double deck to play


they rang and blew the sealers call the poaching cry of the sea
and they raised the baltic out of the mist and an angry ship was she
and blind they groped through the whirling white and blind to the bay again
till they heard the creak of the stralsunds boom and the clank of her mooring chain
they laid them down by bitt and boat their pistols in their belts
and will you fight for it reuben paine or will you share the pelts


a dogtoothed laugh laughed reuben paine and bared his flenchingknife
yea skin for skin and all that he hath a man will give for his life
but ive six thousand skins below and yeddo port to see
and theres never a law of god or man runs north of fiftythree
so go in peace to the naked seas with empty holds to fill
and ill be good to your seal this catch as many as i shall kill


answered the snap of a closing lock and the jar of a gunbutt slid
but the tender fog shut fold on fold to hide the wrong they did
the weeping fog rolled fold on fold the wrath of man to cloak
and the flamespurts pale ran down the rail as the sealingrifles spoke
the bullets bit on bend and butt the splinter slivered free
little they trust to sparrowdust that stop the seal in his sea
the thick smoke hung and would not shift leaden it lay and blue
but three were down on the baltics deck and two of the stralsunds crew
an armslength out and overside the banked fog held them bound
but as they heard or groan or word they fired at the sound


for one cried out on the name of god and one to have him cease
and the questing volley found them both and bade them hold their peace
and one called out on a heathen joss and one on the virgins name
and the schooling bullet leaped across and showed them whence they came
and in the waiting silences the rudder whined beneath
and each man drew his watchful breath slow taken tween the teeth
trigger and ear and eye acock knit brow and harddrawn lips
bracing his feet by chock and cleat for the rolling of the ships
till they heard the cough of a wounded man that fought in the fog for breath
till they heard the torment of reuben paine that wailed upon his death


the tides theyll go through fundy race but ill go nevermore
and see the hogs from ebbtide mark turn scampering back to shore
no more ill see the trawlers drift below the bass rock ground
or watch the tall fall steamer lights tear blazing up the sound
sorrow is me in a lonely sea and a sinful fight i fall
but if theres law o god or man youll swing for it yet tom hall
tom hall stood up by the quarterrail your words in your teeth said he
theres never a law of god or man runs north of fiftythree
so go in grace with him to face and an illspent life behind
and ill be good to your widows rube as many as i shall find


a stralsund man shot blind and large and a warlock finn was he
and he hit tom hall with a bursting ball a handsbreadth over the knee
tom hall caught hold by the toppinglift and sat him down with an oath
youll wait a little rube he said the devil has called for both
the devil is driving both this tide and the killinggrounds are close
and well go up to the wrath of god as the holluschickie goes
o men put back your guns again and lay your rifles by
weve fought our fight and the best are down let up and let us die


quit firing by the bow there quit call off the baltics crew
youre sure of hell as me or rube but wait till we get through
there went no word between the ships but thick and quick and loud
the lifeblood drummed on the dripping decks with the fogdew from the shroud
the seapull drew them side by side gunnel to gunnel laid
and they felt the sheerstrakes pound and clear but never a word was said


then reuben paine cried out again before his spirit passed
have i followed the sea for thirty years to die in the dark at last
curse on her work that has nipped me here with a shifty trick unkind
i have gotten my death where i got my bread but i dare not face it blind
curse on the fog is there never a wind of all the winds i knew
to clear the smother from off my chest and let me look at the blue
the good fog heard like a splitten sail to left and right she tore
and they saw the sundogs in the haze and the seal upon the shore


silver and gray ran spit and bay to meet the steelbacked tide
and pinched and white in the clearing light the crews stared overside
o rainbowgay the red pools lay that swilled and spilled and spread
and gold raw gold the spent shell rolled between the careless dead
the dead that rocked so drunkenwise to weather and to lee
and they saw the work their hands had done as god had bade them see


and a little breeze blew over the rail that made the headsails lift
but no man stood by wheel or sheet and they let the schooners drift
and the rattle rose in reubens throat and he cast his soul with a cry
and gone already tom hall he said then its time for me to die
his eyes were heavy with great sleep and yearning for the land
and he spoke as a man that talks in dreams his wound beneath his hand
oh there comes no good o the westering wind that backs against the sun
wash down the decks theyre all too red and share the skins and run
baltic stralsund and northern light clean share and share for all
youll find the fleets off tolstoi mees but you will not find tom hall
evil he did in shoalwater and blacker sin on the deep
but now hes sick of watch and trick and now hell turn and sleep


hell have no more of the crawling sea that made him suffer so
but hell lie down on the killinggrounds where the holluschickie go
and west youll sail and south again beyond the seafogs rim
and tell the yoshiwara girls to burn a stick for him
and youll not weight him by the heels and dump him overside
but carry him up to the sandhollows to die as bering died
and make a place for reuben paine that knows the fight was fair
and leave the two that did the wrong to talk it over there


halfsteam ahead by guess and lead for the sun is mostly veiled
through fog to fog by luck and log sail ye as bering sailed
and if the light shall lift aright to give your landfall plain
north and by west from zapne crest ye raise the crosses twain
fair marks are they to the inner bay the reckless poacher knows
what time the scarred seecatchie lead their sleek seraglios


ever they hear the floepack clear and the blast of the old bullwhale
and the deep sealroar that beats offshore above the loudest gale
ever they wait the winters hate as the thundering boorga calls
where northward look they to st george and westward to st pauls
ever they greet the hunted fleet lone keels off headlands drear
when the sealingschooners flit that way at hazard year by year


ever in yokohama port men tell the tale anew
of a hidden sea and a hidden fight
when the baltic ran from the northern light
and the stralsund fought the two


i was the staunchest of our fleet
till the sea rose beneath our feet
unheralded in hatred past all measure
into his pits he stamped my crew
buffeted blinded bound and threw
bidding me eyeless wait upon his pleasure


man made me and my will
is to my maker still
whom now the currents con the rollers steer
lifting forlorn to spy
trailed smoke along the sky
falling afraid lest any keel come near


wrenched as the lips of thirst
wried dried and split and burst
bonebleached my decks windscoured to the graining
and jarred at every roll
the gear that was my soul
answers the anguish of my beams complaining


for life that crammed me full
gangs of the prying gull
that shriek and scrabble on the riven hatches
for roar that dumbed the gale
my hawsepipes guttering wail
sobbing my heart out through the uncounted watches


blind in the hot blue ring
through all my points i swing
swing and return to shift the sun anew
blind in my wellknown sky
i hear the stars go by
mocking the prow that cannot hold one true


white on my wasted path
wave after wave in wrath
frets gainst his fellow warring where to send me
flung forward heaved aside
witless and dazed i bide
the mercy of the comber that shall end me


north where the bergs careen
the spray of seas unseen
smokes round my head and freezes in the falling
south where the corals breed
the footless floating weed
folds me and fouls me strake on strake upcrawling


i that was clean to run
my race against the sun
strength on the deep am bawd to all disaster
whipped forth by night to meet
my sisters careless feet
and with a kiss betray her to my master


man made me and my will
is to my maker still
to him and his our peoples at their pier
lifting in hope to spy
trailed smoke along the sky
falling afraid lest any keel come near


a rose in tatters on the garden path
cried out to god and murmured gainst his wrath
because a sudden wind at twilights hush
had snapped her stem alone of all the bush
and god who hears both sundried dust and sun
had pity whispering to that luckless one
sister in that thou sayest we did not well
what voices heardst thou when thy petals fell
and the rose answered in that evil hour
a voice said father wherefore falls the flower
for lo the very gossamers are still
and a voice answered son by allahs will


then softly as a rainmist on the sward
came to the rose the answer of the lord
sister before we smote the dark in twain
ere yet the stars saw one another plain
time tide and space we bound unto the task
that thou shouldst fall and such an one should ask
whereat the withered flower all content
died as they die whose days are innocent
while he who questioned why the flower fell
caught hold of god and saved his soul from hell


you couldnt pack a broadwood half a mile
you mustnt leave a fiddle in the damp
you couldnt raft an organ up the nile
and play it in an equatorial swamp
i travel with the cookingpots and pails
im sandwiched tween the coffee and the pork
and when the dusty column checks and tails
you should hear me spur the rearguard to a walk
with my pillywillywinkywinky popp
oh its any tune that comes into my head
so i keep em moving forward till they drop
so i play em up to water and to bed


in the silence of the camp before the fight
when its good to make your will and say your prayer
you can hear my strumptytumpty overnight
explaining ten to one was always fair
im the prophet of the utterly absurd
of the patently impossible and vain
and when the thing that couldnt has occurred
give me time to change my leg and go again
with my tumpatumpatumpatumpa tump
in the desert where the dungfed campsmoke curled
there was never voice before us till i led our lonely chorus
i the wardrum of the white man round the world


by the bitter road the younger son must tread
ere he win to hearth and saddle of his own
mid the riot of the shearers at the shed
in the silence of the herders hut alone
in the twilight on a bucket upside down
hear me babble what the weakest wont confess
i am memory and torment i am town
i am all that ever went with evening dress
with my tunka tunkatunkatunkatunk
so the lights the london lights grow near and plain
so i rowel em afresh towards the devil and the flesh
till i bring my broken rankers home again


in desire of many marvels over sea
where the newraised tropic city sweats and roars
i have sailed with young ulysses from the quay
till the anchor rumbled down on stranger shores
he is blooded to the open and the sky
he is taken in a snare that shall not fail
he shall hear me singing strongly till he die
like the shouting of a backstay in a gale
with my hya heeya heeya hullah haul
o the green that thunders aft along the deck
are you sick o towns and men you must sign and sail again
for its johnny bowlegs pack your kit and trek


through the gorge that gives the stars at noonday clear
up the pass that packs the scud beneath our wheel
round the bluff that sinks her thousand fathom sheer
down the valley with our guttering brakes asqueal
where the trestle groans and quivers in the snow
where the manyshedded levels loop and twine
so i lead my reckless children from below
till we sing the song of roland to the pine
with my tinkatinkatinkatinkatink
and the axe has cleared the mountain croup and crest
so we ride the iron stallions down to drink
through the canons to the waters of the west


and the tunes that mean so much to you alone
common tunes that make you choke and blow your nose
vulgar tunes that bring the laugh that brings the groan
i can rip your very heartstrings out with those
with the feasting and the folly and the fun
and the lying and the lusting and the drink
and the merry play that drops you when youre done
to the thoughts that burn like irons if you think
with my plunkalunkalunkalunkalunk
heres a trifle on account of pleasure past
ere the wit that made you win gives you eyes to see your sin
and the heavier repentance at the last


let the organ moan her sorrow to the roof
i have told the naked stars the grief of man
let the trumpets snare the foeman to the proof
i have known defeat and mocked it as we ran
my bray ye may not alter nor mistake
when i stand to jeer the fatted soul of things
but the song of lost endeavour that i make
is it hidden in the twanging of the strings
with my tararararararararrrp
is it naught to you that hear and pass me by
but the word the word is mine when the order moves the line
and the lean locked ranks go roaring down to die


of the driven dust of speech i make a flame
and a scourge of broken withes that men let fall
for the words that had no honour till i came
lo i raise them into honour over all
by the wisdom of the centuries i speak
to the tune of yestermorn i set the truth
i the joy of life unquestioned i the greek
i the everlasting wonder song of youth
with my tinkatinkatinkatinkatink
what dye lack my noble masters what dye lack
so i draw the world together link by link
yea from delos up to limerick and back


the liner shes a lady an she never looks nor heeds
the manowars her husband an he gives her all she needs

the fear was on the cattle for the gale was on the sea
an the pens broke up on the lower deck an let the creatures free
an the lights went out on the lower deck an no one near but me


i had been singin to them to keep em quiet there
for the lower deck is the dangerousest requirin constant care
an give to me as the strongest man though used to drink and swear


i see my chance was certain of bein horned or trod
for the lower deck was packed with steers thickern peas in a pod
an more pens broke at every roll so i made a contract with god


an by the terms of the contract as i have read the same
if he got me to port alive i would exalt his name
an praise his holy majesty till further orders came


he saved me from the cattle an he saved me from the sea
for they found me tween two drownded ones where the roll had landed me
an a fourinch crack on top of my head as crazy as could be


but that were done by a stanchion an not by a bullock at all
an i lay still for seven weeks convalessing of the fall
an readin the shiny scripture texts in the seamans hospital


an i spoke to god of our contract an he says to my prayer
i never puts on my ministers no more than they can bear
so back you go to the cattleboats an preach my gospel there


for human life is chancy at any kind of trade
but most of all as well you know when the steers are madafraid
so you go back to the cattleboats an preach em as ive said


they must quit drinkin an swearin they mustnt knife on a blow
they must quit gamblin their wages and you must preach it so
for now those boats are more like hell than anything else i know


i didnt want to do it for i knew what i should get
an i wanted to preach religion handsome an out of the wet
but the word of the lord were lain on me an i done what i was set


i have been smit an bruised as warned would be the case
an turned my cheek to the smiter exactly as scripture says
but following that i knocked him down an led him up to grace


an we have preaching on sundays whenever the sea is calm
an i use no knife or pistol an i never take no harm
for the lord abideth back of me to guide my fighting arm


an i sign for fourpoundten a month and save the money clear
an i am in charge of the lower deck an i never lose a steer
an i believe in almighty god an preach his gospel here


the skippers say im crazy but i can prove em wrong
for i am in charge of the lower deck with all that doth belong
which they would not give to a lunatic and the competition so strong


there dwells a wife by the northern gate
and a wealthy wife is she
she breeds a breed o rovin men
and casts them over sea


and some are drowned in deep water
and some in sight o shore
and word goes back to the weary wife
and ever she sends more


for since that wife had gate or gear
or hearth or garth or bield
she willed her sons to the white harvest
and that is a bitter yield


she wills her sons to the wet ploughing
to ride the horse of tree
and syne her sons come back again
farspent from out the sea


the good wifes sons come home again
with little into their hands
but the lore of men that ha dealt with men
in the new and naked lands


but the faith of men that ha brothered men
by more than easy breath
and the eyes o men that ha read wi men
in the open books of death


rich are they rich in wonders seen
but poor in the goods o men
so what they ha got by the skin o their teeth
they sell for their teeth again


for whether they lose to the naked life
or win to their hearts desire
they tell it all to the weary wife
that nods beside the fire


her hearth is wide to every wind
that makes the white ash spin
and tide and tide and tween the tides
her sons go out and in


out with great mirth that do desire
hazard of trackless ways
in with content to wait their watch
and warm before the blaze


and some return by failing light
and some in waking dream
for she hears the heels of the dripping ghosts
that ride the rough roofbeam


home they come home from all the ports
the living and the dead
the good wifes sons come home again
for her blessing on their head


the earth is full of anger
the seas are dark with wrath
the nations in their harness
go up against our path
ere yet we loose the legions
ere yet we draw the blade
jehovah of the thunders
lord god of battles aid


high lust and froward bearing
proud heart rebellious brow
deaf ear and soul uncaring
we seek thy mercy now
the sinner that forswore thee
the fool that passed thee by
our times are known before thee
lord grant us strength to die


for those who kneel beside us
at altars not thine own
who lack the lights that guide us
lord let their faith atone
if wrong we did to call them
by honour bound they came
let not thy wrath befall them
but deal to us the blame


from panic pride and terror
revenge that knows no rein
light haste and lawless error
protect us yet again
cloak thou our undeserving
make firm the shuddering breath
in silence and unswerving
to taste thy lesser death


ah mary pierced with sorrow
remember reach and save
the soul that comes tomorrow
before the god that gave
since each was born of woman
for each at utter need
true comrade and true foeman
madonna intercede


een now their vanguard gathers
een now we face the fray
as thou didst help our fathers
help thou our host today
fulfilled of signs and wonders
in life in death made clear
jehovah of the thunders
lord god of battles hear


thy face is far from this our war
our call and countercry
i shall not find thee quick and kind
nor know thee till i die
enough for me in dreams to see
and touch thy garments hem
thy feet have trod so near to god
i may not follow them


through wantonness if men profess
they weary of thy parts
een let them die at blasphemy
and perish with their arts
but we that love but we that prove
thine excellence august
while we adore discover more
thee perfect wise and just


since spoken word mans spirit stirred
beyond his bellyneed
what is is thine of fair design
in thought and craft and deed
each stroke aright of toil and fight
that was and that shall be
and hope too high wherefore we die
has birth and worth in thee


who holds by thee hath heaven in fee
to gild his dross thereby
and knowledge sure that he endure
a child until he die
for to make plain that mans disdain
is but new beautys birth
for to possess in loneliness
the joy of all the earth


as thou didst teach all lovers speech
and life all mystery
so shalt thou rule by every school
till love and longing die
who wast or yet the lights were set
a whisper in the void
who shalt be sung through planets young
when this is clean destroyed


beyond the bounds our staring rounds
across the pressing dark
the children wise of outer skies
look hitherward and mark
a light that shifts a glare that drifts
rekindling thus and thus
not all forlorn for thou hast borne
strange tales to them of us


time hath no tide but must abide
the servant of thy will
tide hath no time for to thy rhyme
the ranging stars stand still
regent of spheres that lock our fears
our hopes invisible
oh twas certes at thy decrees
we fashioned heaven and hell


pure wisdom hath no certain path
that lacks thy morningeyne
and captains bold by thee controlled
most like to gods design
thou art the voice to kingly boys
to lift them through the fight
and comfortress of unsuccess
to give the dead goodnight


a veil to draw twixt god his law
and mans infirmity
a shadow kind to dumb and blind
the shambles where we die
a rule to trick th arithmetic
too base of leaguing odds
the spur of trust the curb of lust
thou handmaid of the gods


o charity all patiently
abiding wrack and scaith
o faith that meets ten thousand cheats
yet drops no jot of faith
devil and brute thou dost transmute
to higher lordlier show
who art in sooth that lovely truth
the careless angels know


thy face is far from this our war
our call and countercry
i may not find thee quick and kind
nor know thee till i die


yet may i look with heart unshook
on blow brought home or missed
yet may i hear with equal ear
the clarions down the list
yet set my lance above mischance
and ride the barriere
oh hit or miss how little tis
my lady is not there


buy my english posies
kent and surrey may
violets of the undercliff
wet with channel spray
cowslips from a devon combe
midland furze afire
buy my english posies
and ill sell your hearts desire


buy my english posies
you that scorn the may
wont you greet a friend from home
half the world away
green against the draggled drift
faint and frail and first
buy my northern bloodroot
and ill know where you were nursed


the king has called for priest and cup
the king has taken spur and blade
to dub true thomas a belted knight
and all for the sake o the songs he made


they have sought him high they have sought him low
they have sought him over down and lea
they have found him by the milkwhite thorn
that guards the gates o faerie


twas bent beneath and blue above
their eyes were held that they might not see
the kine that grazed beneath the knowes
oh they were the queens o faerie


now cease your song the king he said
oh cease your song and get you dight
to vow your vow and watch your arms
for i will dub you a belted knight


for i will give you a horse o pride
wi blazon and spur and page and squire
wi keep and tail and seizin and law
and land to hold at your desire


true thomas smiled above his harp
and turned his face to the naked sky
where blown before the wastrel wind
the thistledown she floated by


i ha vowed my vow in another place
and bitter oath it was on me
i ha watched my arms the leelong night
where fivescore fighting men would flee


my lance is tipped o the hammered flame
my shield is beat o the moonlight cold
and i won my spurs in the middle world
a thousand fathom beneath the mould


and what should i make wi a horse o pride
and what should i make wi a sword so brown
but spill the rings o the gentle folk
and flyte my kin in the fairy town


and what should i make wi blazon and belt
wi keep and tail and seizin and fee
and what should i do wi page and squire
that am a king in my own countrie


for i send east and i send west
and i send far as my will may flee
by dawn and dusk and the drinking rain
and syne my sendings return to me


they come wi news of the groanin earth
they come wi news o the roarin sea
wi word of spirit and ghost and flesh
and man thats mazed among the three


the king he bit his nether lip
and smote his hand upon his knee
by the faith o my soul true thomas he said
ye waste no wit in courtesie


as i desire unto my pride
can i make earls by three and three
to run before and ride behind
and serve the sons o my body


and what care i for your rowfoot earls
or all the sons o your body
before they win to the pride o name
i trow they all ask leave o me


for i make honour wi muckle mouth
as i make shame wi mincin feet
to sing wi the priests at the marketcross
or run wi the dogs in the naked street


and some they give me the good red gold
and some they give me the white money
and some they give me a clout o meal
for they be people o low degree


and the song i sing for the counted gold
the same i sing for the white money
but best i sing for the clout o meal
that simple people given me


the king cast down a silver groat
a silver groat o scots money
if i come wi a poor mans dole he said
true thomas will ye harp to me


whenas i harp to the children small
they press me close on either hand
and who are you true thomas said
that you should ride while they must stand


light down light down from your horse o pride
i trow ye talk too loud and hie
and i will make you a triple word
and syne if ye dare ye shall noble me


he has lighted down from his horse o pride
and set his back against the stone
now guard you well true thomas said
ere i rax your heart from your breastbone


true thomas played upon his harp
the fairy harp that couldna lee
and the first least word the proud king heard
it harpit the salt tear out o his ee


oh i see the love that i lost long syne
i touch the hope that i may not see
and all that i did o hidden shame
like little snakes they hiss at me


the sun is lost at noon at noon
the dread o doom has grippit me
true thomas hide me under your cloak
god wot im little fit to dee


twas bent beneath and blue above
twas open field and running flood
where hot on heath and dike and wall
the high sun warmed the adders brood


lie down lie down true thomas said
the god shall judge when all is done
but i will bring you a better word
and lift the cloud that i laid on


true thomas played upon his harp
that birled and brattled to his hand
and the next least word true thomas made
it garred the king take horse and brand


oh i hear the tread o the fighting men
i see the sun on splent and spear
i mark the arrow outen the fern
that flies so low and sings so clear


advance my standards to that war
and bid my good knights prick and ride
the gled shall watch as fierce a fight
as eer was fought on the border side


twas bent beneath and blue above
twas nodding grass and naked sky
where ringing up the wastrel wind
the eyas stooped upon the pie


true thomas sighed above his harp
and turned the song on the midmost string
and the last least word true thomas made
he harpit his dead youth back to the king


now i am prince and i do well
to love my love withouten fear
to walk wi man in fellowship
and breathe my horse behind the deer


my hounds they bay unto the death
the buck has couched beyond the burn
my love she waits at her window
to wash my hands when i return


for that i live am i content
oh i have seen my true loves eyes
to stand wi adam in edenglade
and run in the woods o paradise


twas naked sky and nodding grass
twas running flood and wastrel wind
where checked against the open pass
the red deer belled to call the hind


true thomas laid his harp away
and louted low at the saddleside
he has taken stirrup and hauden rein
and set the king on his horse o pride


sleep ye or wake true thomas said
that sit so still that muse so long
sleep ye or wake till the latter sleep
i trow yell not forget my song


i ha harpit a shadow out o the sun
to stand before your face and cry
i ha armed the earth beneath your heel
and over your head i ha dusked the sky


i ha harpit ye up to the throne o god
i ha harpit your midmost soul in three
i ha harpit ye down to the hinges o hell
and ye would make a knight o me


in the neolithic age savage warfare did i wage
for food and fame and woolly horses pelt
i was singer to my clan in that dim red dawn of man
and i sang of all we fought and feared and felt


yea i sang as now i sing when the prehistoric spring
made the piled biscayan icepack split and shove
and the troll and gnome and dwerg and the gods of cliff and berg
were about me and beneath me and above


but a rival of solutre told the tribe my style was outre
neath a tomahawk of diorite he fell
and i left my views on art barbed and tanged below the heart
of a mammothistic etcher at grenelle


then i stripped them scalp from skull and my hunting dogs fed full
and their teeth i threaded neatly on a thong
and i wiped my mouth and said it is well that they are dead
for i know my work is right and theirs was wrong


but my totem saw the shame from his ridgepole shrine he came
and he told me in a vision of the night
there are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays
and every single one of them is right


then the silence closed upon me till they put new clothing on me
of whiter weaker flesh and bone more frail
and i stepped beneath times finger once again a tribal singer
and a minor poet certified by trll


still they skirmish to and fro men my messmates on the snow
when we headed off the aurochs turn for turn
when the rich allobrogenses never kept amanuenses
and our only plots were piled in lakes at berne


still a cultured christian age sees us scuffle squeak and rage
still we pinch and slap and jabber scratch and dirk
still we let our business slide as we dropped the halfdressed hide
to show a fellowsavage how to work


still the world is wondrous large seven seas from marge to marge
and it holds a vast of various kinds of man
and the wildest dreams of kew are the facts of khatmandhu
and the crimes of clapham chaste in martaban


heres my wisdom for your use as i learned it when the moose
and the reindeer roared where paris roars tonight
there are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays
and every single one of them is right


once on a glittering icefield ages and ages ago
ung a maker of pictures fashioned an image of snow
fashioned the form of a tribesman gaily he whistled and sung
working the snow with his fingers read ye the story of ung


pleased was his tribe with that image came in their hundreds to scan
handled it smelt it and grunted verily this is a man
thus do we carry our lances thus is a warbelt slung
lo it is even as we are glory and honour to ung


later he pictured an aurochs later he pictured a bear
pictured the sabretooth tiger dragging a man to his lair
pictured the mountainous mammoth hairy abhorrent alone
out of the love that he bore them scribing them clearly on bone


swift came the tribe to behold them peering and pushing and still
men of the bergbattered beaches men of the boulderhatched hill
hunters and fishers and trappers presently whispering low
yea they are like and it may be but how does the pictureman know


ung hath he slept with the aurochs watched where the mastodon roam
spoke on the ice with the bowhead followed the sabretooth home
nay these are toys of his fancy if he have cheated us so
how is there truth in his image the man that he fashioned of snow


wroth was that maker of pictures hotly he answered the call
hunters and fishers and trappers children and fools are ye all
look at the beasts when ye hunt them swift from the tumult he broke
ran to the cave of his father and told him the shame that they spoke


and the father of ung gave answer that was old and wise in the craft
maker of pictures aforetime he leaned on his lance and laughed
if they could see as thou seest they would do what thou hast done
and each man would make him a picture and what would become of my son


there would be no pelts of the reindeer flung down at thy cave for a gift
nor dole of the oily timber that comes on the baltic drift
no store of welldrilled needles nor ouches of amber pale
no newcut tongues of the bison nor meat of the stranded whale


thou hast not toiled at the fishing when the sodden trammels freeze
nor worked the warboats outward through the rush of the rockstaked seas
yet they bring thee fish and plunder full meal and an easy bed
and all for the sake of thy pictures and ung held down his head


thou hast not stood to the aurochs when the red snow reeks of the fight
men have no time at the houghing to count his curls aright
and the heart of the hairy mammoth thou sayest they do not see
yet they save it whole from the beaches and broil the best for thee


and now do they press to thy pictures with opened mouth and eye
and a little gift in the doorway and the praise no gift can buy
but sure they have doubted thy pictures and that is a grievous stain
son that can see so clearly return them their gifts again


and ung looked down at his deerskins their broad shelltasselled bands
and ung drew downward his mitten and looked at his naked hands
and he gloved himself and departed and he heard his father behind
son that can see so clearly rejoice that thy tribe is blind


straight on the glittering icefield by the caves of the lost dordogne
ung a maker of pictures fell to his scribing on bone
even to mammoth editions gaily he whistled and sung
blessing his tribe for their blindness heed ye the story of ung


full thirty foot she towered from waterline to rail
it cost a watch to steer her and a week to shorten sail
but spite all modern notions i found her first and best
the only certain packet for the islands of the blest


fair held the breeze behind us twas warm with lovers prayers
wed stolen wills for ballast and a crew of missing heirs
they shipped as able bastards till the wicked nurse confessed
and they worked the old threedecker to the islands of the blest


by ways no gaze could follow a course unspoiled of cook
per fancy fleetest in man our titled berths we took
with maids of matchless beauty and parentage unguessed
and a church of england parson for the islands of the blest


we asked no social questions we pumped no hidden shame
we never talked obstetrics when the little stranger came
we left the lord in heaven we left the fiends in hell
we werent exactly yussufs but zuleika didnt tell


no moral doubt assailed us so when the port we neared
the villain had his flogging at the gangway and we cheered
twas fiddle in the forcsle twas garlands on the mast
for every one got married and i went ashore at last


i left em all in couples akissing on the decks
i left the lovers loving and the parents signing cheques
in endless english comfort by countyfolk caressed
i left the old threedecker at the islands of the blest


that route is barred to steamers youll never lift again
our purplepainted headlands or the lordly keeps of spain
theyre just beyond your skyline howeer so far you cruise
in a ramyoudamnyou liner with a brace of bucking screws


swing round your aching searchlight twill show no havens peace
ay blow your shrieking sirens to the deaf graybearded seas
boom out the dripping oilbags to skin the deeps unrest
and you arent one knot the nearer to the islands of the blest


but when youre threshing crippled with broken bridge and rail
at a drogue of dead convictions to hold you head to gale
calm as the flying dutchman from truck to taffrail dressed
youll see the old threedecker for the islands of the blest


youll see her tiering canvas in sheeted silver spread
youll hear the longdrawn thunder neath her leaping figurehead
while far so far above you her tall pooplanterns shine
unvexed by wind or weather like the candles round a shrine


hull down hull down and under she dwindles to a speck
with noise of pleasant music and dancing on her deck
alls well alls well aboard her shes left you far behind
with a scent of oldworld roses through the fog that ties you blind


her crew are babes or madmen her port is all to make
youre manned by truth and science and you steam for steamings sake
well tinker up your engines you know your business best
shes taking tired people to the islands of the blest


if the led striker call it a strike
or the papers call it a war
they know not much what i am like
nor what he is my avatar


through many roads by me possessed
he shambles forth in cosmic guise
he is the jester and the jest
and he the text himself applies


the celt is in his heart and hand
the gaul is in his brain and nerve
where cosmopolitanly planned
he guards the redskins dry reserve


his easy unswept hearth he lends
from labrador to guadeloupe
till elbowed out by sloven friends
he camps at sufferance on the stoop


calmeyed he scoffs at sword and crown
or panicblinded stabs and slays
blatant he bids the world bow down
or cringing begs a crust of praise


or sombredrunk at mine and mart
he dubs his dreary brethren kings
his hands are black with blood his heart
leaps as a babes at little things


but through the shift of mood and mood
mine ancient humour saves him whole
the cynic devil in his blood
that bids him mock his hurrying soul


that bids him flout the law he makes
that bids him make the law he flouts
till dazed by many doubts he wakes
the drumming guns that have no doubts


that checks him foolish hot and fond
that chuckles through his deepest ire
that gilds the slough of his despond
but dims the goal of his desire


inopportune shrillaccented
the acrid asiatic mirth
that leaves him careless mid his dead
the scandal of the elder earth


how shall he clear himself how reach
your bar or weighed defence prefer
a brother hedged with alien speech
and lacking all interpreter


which knowledge vexes him a space
but while reproof around him rings
he turns a keen untroubled face
home to the instant need of things


enslaved illogical elate
he greets th embarrassed gods nor fears
to shake the iron hand of fate
or match with destiny for beers


lo imperturbable he rules
unkempt disreputable vast
and in the teeth of all the schools
i i shall save him at the last


ive paid for your sickest fancies ive humoured your crackedest whim
dick its your daddy dying youve got to listen to him
good for a fortnight am i the doctor told you he lied
i shall go under by morning and put that nurse outside
never seen death yet dickie well now is your time to learn
and youll wish you held my record before it comes to your turn
not counting the line and the foundry the yards and the village too
ive made myself and a million but im damned if i made you
master at twoandtwenty and married at twentythree
ten thousand men on the payroll and forty freighters at sea
fifty years between em and every year of it fight
and now im sir anthony gloster dying a baronite
for i lunched with his royal highness what was it the papers ahad
not least of our merchantprinces dickie thats me your dad
i didnt begin with askings i took my job and i stuck
and i took the chances they wouldnt an now theyre calling it luck
lord what boats ive handled rotten and leaky and old
ran em or opened the bilgecock precisely as i was told


grub that hud bind you crazy and crews that hud turn you grey
and a big fat lump of insurance to cover the risk on the way
the others they dursnt do it they said they valued their life
theyve served me since as skippers i went and i took my wife
over the world i drove em married at twentythree
and your mother saving the money and making a man of me
i was content to be master but she said there was better behind
she took the chances i wouldnt and i followed your mother blind
she egged me to borrow the money an she helped me to clear the loan
when we bought half shares in a cheap hun and hoisted a flag of our own
patching and coaling on credit and living the lord knew how
we started the red ox freighters weve eightandthirty now


and those were the days of clippers and the freights were clipperfreights
and we knew we were making our fortune but she died in macassar straits
by the little paternosters as you come to the union bank
and we dropped her in fourteen fathom i pricked it off where she sank
owners we were full owners and the boat was christened for her
and she died in the mary gloster my heart how young we were
so i went on a spree round java and wellnigh ran her ashore
but your mother came and warned me and i wouldnt liquor no more
strict i stuck to my business afraid to stop or id think
saving the money she warned me and letting the other men drink
and i met mcullough in london id turned five hundred then
and tween us we started the foundry three forges and twenty men
cheap repairs for the cheap huns it paid and the business grew
for i bought me a steamlathe patent and that was a gold mine too
cheaper to build em than buy em i said but mcullough he shied
and we wasted a year in talking before we moved to the clyde


and the lines were all beginning and we all of us started fair
building our engines like houses and staying the boilers square
but mcullough he wanted cabins with marble and maple and all
and brussels an utrecht velvet and baths and a social hall
and pipes for closets all over and cutting the frames too light
but mcullough he died in the sixties and well im dying tonight
i knew i knew what was coming when we bid on the byfleets keel
they piddled and piffled with iron id given my orders for steel
steel and the first expansions it paid i tell you it paid
when we came with our nineknot freighters and collared the longrun trade
and they asked me how i did it and i gave em the scripture text
you keep your light so shining a little in front o the next
they copied all they could follow but they couldnt copy my mind
and i left em sweating and stealing a year and a half behind


then came the armourcontracts but that was mculloughs side
he was always best in the foundry but better perhaps he died
i went through his private papers the notes was plainer than print
and im no fool to finish if a manll give me a hint
i remember his widow was angry so i saw what the drawings meant
and i started the sixinch rollers and it paid me sixty per cent
sixty per cent with failures and more than twice we could do
and a quartermillion to credit and i saved it all for you
i thought it doesnt matter you seemed to favour your ma
but youre nearer forty than thirty and i know the kind you are


harrer an trinity college i ought to ha sent you to sea
but i stood you an education an what have you done for me
the things i knew was proper you wouldnt thank me to give
and the things i knew was rotten you said was the way to live
for you muddled with books and pictures an china an etchins an fans
and your rooms at college was beastly more like a whores than a mans
till you married that thinflanked woman as white and as stale as a bone
an she gave you your social nonsense but wheres that kid o your own
ive seen your carriages blocking the half o the cromwell road
but never the doctors brougham to help the missus unload


so there isnt even a grandchild an the gloster familys done
not like your mother she isnt she carried her freight each run
but they died the pore little beggars at sea she had em they died
only you an you stood it you havent stood much beside
weak a liar and idle and mean as a colliers whelp
nosing for scraps in the galley no help my son was no help
so he gets three hundred thousand in trust and the interest paid
i wouldnt give it you dickie you see i made it in trade
youre saved from soiling your fingers and if you have no child
it all comes back to the business gad wont your wife be wild
calls and calls in her carriage her handkerchief up to her eye
daddy dear daddys dyin and doing her best to cry
grateful oh yes im grateful but keep her away from here
your mother hud never ha stood er and anyhow women are queer


theres women will say ive married a second timenot quite
but give pore aggie a hundred and tell her your lawyersll fight
she was the best o the boiling youll meet her before it ends
im in for a row with the mother ill leave you settle my friends
for a man he must go with a woman which women dont understand
or the sort that say they can see it they arent the marrying brand
but i wanted to speak o your mother thats lady gloster still
im going to up and see her without its hurting the will

theres some ship bodies for burial weve carried em soldered and packed
down in their wills they wrote it and nobody called them cracked
but me ive too much money and people might all my fault
it come o hoping for grandsons and buying that wokin vault
im sick o the whole dam business im going back where i came
dick youre the son o my body and youll take charge o the same
i want to lie by your mother ten thousand mile away
and theyll want to send me to woking and thats where youll earn your pay
ive thought it out on the quiet the same as it ought to be done
quiet and decent and proper an heres your orders my son


you know the line you dont though you write to the board and tell
your fathers death has upset you an youre goin to cruise for a spell
an youd like the mary gloster ive held her ready for this
theyll put her in working order and youll take her out as she is
yes it was money idle when i patched her and put her aside
thank god i can pay for my fancies the boat where your mother died
by the little paternosters as you come to the union bank
we dropped her i think i told you and i pricked it off where she sank
tiny she looked on the grating that oily treacly sea
hundred and eighteen east remember and south just three


easy bearings to carry three south three to the dot
but i gave mhandrew a copy in case of dying or not
and so youll write to mhandrew hes chief of the maori line
theyll give him leave if you ask em and say its business o mine
i built three boats for the maoris an very well pleased they were
an ive known mac since the fifties and mac knew me and her
after the first stroke warned me i sent him the money to keep
against the time youd claim it committin your dad to the deep


for you are the son o my body and mac was my oldest friend
ive never asked him to dinner but hell see it out to the end
stiffnecked glasgow beggar ive heard hes prayed for my soul
but he couldnt lie if you paid him and hed starve before he stole
hell take the mary in ballast youll find her a lively ship
and youll take sir anthony gloster that goes on his weddingtrip
lashed in our old deckcabin with all three portholes wide
the kick o the screw beneath him and the round blue seas outside
sir anthony glosters carriage our houseflag flyin free
ten thousand men on the payroll and forty freighters at sea


he made himself and a million but this world is a fleetin show
and hell go to the wife of his bosom the same as he ought to go
by the heel of the paternosters there isnt a chance to mistake
and macll pay you the money as soon as the bubbles break
five thousand for six weeks cruising the staunchest freighter afloat
and mac hell give you your bonus the minute im out o the boat
hell take you round to macassar and youll come back alone
he knows what i want o the mary ill do what i please with my own
your mother hud call it wasteful but ive sevenandthirty more
ill come in my private carriage and bid it wait at the door
for my son he was never a credit he muddled with books and art
and he lived on sir anthonys money and he broke sir anthonys heart
there isnt even a grandchild and the gloster familys done
the only one you left me o mother the only one


harrer and trinity college me slavin early an late
an he thinks im dying crazy and youre in macassar strait
flesh o my flesh my dearie for ever an ever amen

but cheap repairs for a cheap hun the doctors said id do
mary why didnt you warn me ive allus heeded to you
excep i know about women but you are a spirit now
an wife they was only women and i was a man thats how
an a man he must go with a woman as you could not understand
but i never talked em secrets i paid em out o hand


thank gawd i can pay for my fancies now whats five thousand to me
for a berth off the paternosters in the haven where i would be
i believe in the resurrection if i read my bible plain
but i wouldnt trust em at wokin were safer at sea again
for the heart it shall go with the treasure go down to the sea in ships
im sick of the hired women ill kiss my girl on her lips
ill be content with my fountain ill drink from my own well
and the wife of my youth shall charm me an the rest can go to hell
dickie he will thats certain ill lie in our standinbed
an macll take her in ballast an she trims best by the head
down by the head an sinkin her fires are drawn and cold
and the waters splashin hollow on the skin of the empty hold
churning an choking and chuckling quiet and scummy and dark
full to her lower hatches and risin steady hark
that was the afterbulkhead shes flooded from stem to stern
never seen death yet dickie well now is your time to learn

through the plagues of egyp we was chasin arabi
gettin down an shovin in the sun
an you might have called us dirty an you might ha called us dry
an you might have heard us talkin at the gun
but the captain had his jacket an the jacket it was new
horse gunners listen to my song
an the wettin of the jacket is the proper thing to do
nor we didnt keep him waitin very long


one day they gave us orders for to shell a sand redoubt
loadin down the axlearms with case
but the captain knew his dooty an he took the crackers out
an he put some proper liquor in its place
an the captain saw the shrapnel which is sixanthirty clear
horse gunners listen to my song
will you draw the weight sez he or will you draw the beer
an we didnt keep him waitin very long


then we trotted gentle not to break the bloomin glass
though the arabites had all their ranges marked
but we dursnt hardly gallop for the most was bottled bass
an wed dreamed of it since we was disembarked
so we fired economic with the shells we had in hand
horse gunners listen to my song
but the beggars under cover had the impidence to stand
an we couldnt keep em waitin very long


so we finished harf the liquor an the captain took champagne
an the arabites was shootin all the while
an we left our wounded happy with the empties on the plain
an we used the bloomin guns for projectile
we limbered up an galloped there were nothin else to do
horse gunners listen to my song
an the battery came aboundin like a boundin kangaroo
but they didnt watch us comin very long


we was goin most extended we was drivin very fine
an the arabites were loosin high an wide
till the captain took the glassy with a rattlin right incline
an we dropped upon their heads the other side
then we give em quarter such as hadnt up and cut
horse gunners listen to my song
an the captain stood a limberful of fizzy somethin brutt
but we didnt leave it fizzing very long


we might ha been courtmartialled but it all come out all right
when they signalled us to join the main command
there was every round expended there was every gunner tight
an the captain waved a corkscrew in his hand


the heathen in his blindness bows down to wood an stone
he dont obey no orders unless they is his own
he keeps his sidearms awful he leaves em all about
an then comes up the regiment an pokes the heathen out


all along o dirtiness all along o mess
all along o doin things rathermoreorless
all along of abbynay kul an hazarho
mind you keep your rifle an yourself jus so


the young recruit is haughty he drafs from gawd knows where
they bid him show his stockins an lay his mattress square
he calls it bloomin nonsense he doesnt know no more
an then up comes his company an kicks him round the floor


the young recruit is hammered he takes it very hard
he hangs his head an mutters he sulks about the yard
he talks o cruel tyrants hell swing for byanby
an the others hears an mocks him an the boy goes orf to cry


the young recruit is silly he thinks o suicide
hes lost his gutterdevil he hasnt got his pride
but day by day they kicks him which helps him on a bit
till he finds hisself one mornin with a full an proper kit


gettin clear o dirtiness gettin done with mess
gettin shut o doin things rathermoreorless
not so fond of abbynay kul nor hazarho
learns to keep his rifle an hisself jus so


the young recruit is happy he throws a chest to suit
you see him grow mustaches you hear him slap his boot
he learns to drop the bloodies from every word he slings
an he shows an healthy brisket when he strips for bars an rings


the crueltyrantsergeants they watch him harf a year
they watch him with his comrades they watch him with his beer
they watch him with the women at the regimental dance
and the crueltyrantsergeants send his name along for lance


an now hes harf o nothin an all a private yet
his room they up an rags him to see what they will get
they rags him low an cunnin each dirty trick they can
but he learns to sweat his temper an he learns to sweat his man


an last a coloursergeant as such to be obeyed
he schools his men at cricket he tells em on parade
they sees em quick an handy uncommon set an smart
an so he talks to orficers which have the core at heart


he learns to do his watchin without it showin plain
he learns to save a dummy an shove him straight again
he learns to check a ranker thats buyin leave to shirk
an he learns to make men like him so theyll learn to like their work


an when it comes to marchin hell see their socks are right
an when it comes to action he shows em how to sight
he knows their ways of thinkin and just whats in their mind
he knows when they are takin on an when theyve fell behind


he knows each talkin corpril that leads a squad astray
he feels his innards heavin his bowels givin way
he sees the bluewhite faces all tryin hard to grin
an he stands an waits an suffers till its time to cap em in


an now the hugly bullets come peckin through the dust
an no one wants to face em but every beggar must
so like a man in irons which isnt glad to go
they moves em off by companies uncommon stiff an slow


of all his five years schoolin they dont remember much
excep the not retreatin the step an keepin touch
it looks like teachin wasted when they duck an spread an hop
but if he hadnt learned em theyd be all about the shop


an now its oo goes backward an now its oo comes on
and now its get the doolies an now the captains gone
an now its bloody murder but all the while they hear
his voice the same as barrick drill ashepherdin the rear


hes just as sick as they are his heart is like to split
but he works em works em works em till he feels em take the bit
the rest is holdin steady till the watchful bugles play
an he lifts em lifts em lifts em through the charge that wins the day


the heathen in his blindness bows down to wood an stone
he dont obey no orders unless they is his own
the heathen in his blindness must end where he began
but the backbone of the army is the noncommissioned man


keep away from dirtiness keep away from mess
dont get into doin things rathermoreorless
lets ha done with abbynay kul an hazarho
mind you keep your rifle an yourself jus so


sez the junior orderly sergeant
to the senior orderly man
our orderly orfcers hokeemut
you help him all you can
for the wine was old and the night is cold
an the best we may go wrong
so fore he gits to the sentrybox
you pass the word along


so it was rounds what rounds at two of a frosty night
hes holdin on by the sergeants sash but sentry shut your eye
an it was pass alls well oh aint he drippin tight
hell need an affidavit pretty badly byanby


the moon was white on the barricks
the road was white an wide
an the orderly orfcer took it all
an the tenfoot ditch beside
an the corporal pulled an the sergeant pushed
an the three they danced along
but id shut my eyes in the sentrybox
so i didnt see nothin wrong


twas after four in the mornin
we had to stop the fun
an we sent him home on a bullockcart
with his belt an stock undone
but we sluiced him down an we washed him out
an a firstclass job we made
when we saved him smart as a bombardier
for sixoclock parade


the drill was long an heavy
the sky was hot an blue
an his eye was wild an his hair was wet
but his sergeant pulled him through
our men was good old trusties
theyd done it on their head
but you ought to have heard em markin time
to hide the things he said


there was twoanthirty sergeants
there was corprals fortyone
there was just nine hundred rank an file
to swear to a touch o sun
there was me hed kissed in the sentrybox
as i have not told in my song
but i took my oath which were bible truth
i hadnt seen nothin wrong


theres them thats hot an haughty
theres them thats cold an hard
but there comes a night when the best gets tight
and then turns out the guard
ive seen them hide their liquor
in every kind o way
but most depends on makin friends
with privit thomas a


you call yourself a man
for all you used to swear
an leave me as you can
my certain shame to bear
i hear you do not care
you done the worst you know
i hate you grinnin there
ah gawd i love you so


nice while it lasted an now it is over
tear out your heart an goodbye to your lover
whats the use o grievin when the mother that bore you
mary pity women knew it all before you


it arent no false alarm
the finish to your fun
you you have brung the harm
an im the ruined one
an now youll off an run
with some new fool in tow
your heart you havent none
ah gawd i love you so


when a man is tired there is naught will bind him
all he solemn promised he will shove behind him
whats the good o prayin for the wrath to strike him
mary pity women when the rest are like him


what hope for me or it

the injian ocean sets an smiles
so sof so bright so bloomin blue
there arent a wave for miles an miles
excep the jiggle from the screw
the ship is swep the day is done
the bugles gone for smoke and play
an black agin the settin sun
the lascar sings hum deckty hai


for to admire an for to see
for to behold this world so wide
it never done no good to me
but i cant drop it if i tried


i see the sergeants pitchin quoits
i hear the women laugh an talk
i spy upon the quarterdeck
the orficers an lydies walk
i thinks about the things that was
an leans an looks acrost the sea
till spite of all the crowded ship
theres no one lef alive but me


the things that was which i have seen
in barrick camp an action too
i tells them over by myself
an sometimes wonders if theyre true
for they was odd most awful odd
but all the same now they are oer
there must be heaps o plenty such
an if i wait ill see some more


oh i have come upon the books
an frequent broke a barrick rule
an stood beside an watched myself
behavin like a bloomin fool
i paid my price for findin out
nor never grutched the price i paid
but sat in clink without my boots
admirin how the world was made


behold a crowd upon the beam
an humped above the sea appears
old aden like a barrickstove
that no ones lit for years an years
i passed by that when i began
an i go home the road i came
a timeexpired soldierman
with six years service to his name


my girl she said oh stay with me
my mother held me to her breast
theyve never written none an so
they must have gone with all the rest
with all the rest which i have seen
an found an known an met along
i cannot say the things i feel
and so i sing my evenin song


when earths last picture is painted and the tubes are twisted and dried
when the oldest colours have faded and the youngest critic has died
we shall rest and faith we shall need it lie down for an aeon or two
till the master of all good workmen shall put us to work anew


and those that were good shall be happy they shall sit in a golden chair
they shall splash at a tenleague canvas with brushes of comets hair
they shall find real saints to draw from magdalene peter and paul
they shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all


and only the master shall praise us and only the master shall blame
and no one shall work for money and no one shall work for fame
but each for the joy of the working and each in his separate star
shall draw the thing as he sees it for the god of things as they are


god of our fathers known of old
lord of our farflung battle line
beneath whose awful hand we hold
dominion over palm and pine
lord god of hosts be with us yet
lest we forgetlest we forget


the tumult and the shouting dies
the captains and the kings depart
still stands thine ancient sacrifice
an humble and a contrite heart
lord god of hosts be with us yet
lest we forgetlest we forget


farcalled our navies melt away
on dune and headland sinks the fire
lo all our pomp of yesterday
is one with nineveh and tyre
lord god of hosts be with us yet
lest we forgetlest we forget


if drunk with sight of power we loose
wild tongues that have not thee in awe
such boastings as the gentiles use
or lesser breeds without the law
lord god of hosts be with us yet
lest we forgetlest we forget


for heathen heart that puts her trust
in reeking tube and iron shard
all valiant dust that builds on dust
and guarding calls not thee to guard
for frantic boast and foolish word
thy mercy on thy people lord


a fool there was and he made his prayer
even as you and i
to a rag and a bone and a hank of hair
we called her the woman who did not care
but the fool he called her his lady fair
even as you and i


oh the years we waste and the tears we waste
and the work of our head and hand
belong to the woman who did not know
and now we know that she never could know
and did not understand


a fool there was and his goods he spent
even as you and i
honor and faith and a sure intent
but a fool must follow his natural bent
and it wasnt the least what the lady meant
even as you and i


oh the toil we lost and the spoil we lost
and the excellent things we planned
belong to the woman who didnt know why
and now we know she never knew why
and did not understand


the fool we stripped to his foolish hide
even as you and i
which she might have seen when she threw him aside
but it isnt on record the lady tried
so some of him lived but the most of him died
even as you and i


and it isnt the shame and it isnt the blame
that stings like a white hot brand
its coming to know that she never knew why
seeing at last she could never know why
and never could understand


will you conquer my heart with your beauty my soul going out from afar
shall i fall to your hand as a victim of crafty and cautious shikar


have i met you and passed you already unknowing unthinking and blind
shall i meet you next session at simla o sweetest and best of your kind


does the p and o bear you to meward or clad in short frocks in the west
are you growing the charms that shall capture and torture the heart in my breast


will you stay in the plains till septembermy passion as warm as the day
will you bring me to book on the mountains or where the thermantidotes play


when the light of your eyes shall make pallid the mean lesser lights i pursue
and the charm of your presence shall lure me from love of the gay thirteentwo


when the peg and the pigskin shall please not when i buy me calcuttabuild clothes
when i quit the delight of wild asses forswearing the swearing of oaths


as a deer to the hand of the hunter when i turn mid the gibes of my friends
when the days of my freedom are numbered and the life of the bachelor ends


ah goddess child spinster or widowas of old on mars hill whey they raised
to the god that they knew not an altarso i a young pagan have praised


the goddess i know not nor worship yet if half that men tell me be true
you will come in the future and therefore these verses are written to you


now the new year reviving last years debt
the thoughtful fisher casteth wide his net
so i with begging dish and ready tongue
assail all men for all that i can get


imports indeed are gone with all their dues
lo salt a lever that i dare not use
nor may i ask the tillers in bengal
surely my kith and kin will not refuse


payand i promise by the dust of spring
retrenchment if my promises can bring
comfort ye have them now a thousandfold
by allah i will promise anything


indeed indeed retrenchment oft before
i sworebut did i mean it when i swore
and then and then we wandered to the hills
and so the little less became much more


whether a boileaugunge or babylon
i know not how the wretched thing is done
the items of receipt grow surely small
the items of expense mount one by one


i cannot help it what have i to do
with one and five or four or three or two
let scribes spit blood and sulphur as they please
or statesmen call me foolishheed not you


behold i promiseanything you will
behold i greet you with an empty till
ah fellowsinners of your charity
seek not the reason of the dearth but fill


for if i sinned and fell where lies the gain
of knowledge would it ease you of your pain
to know the tangled threads of revenue
i ravel deeper in a hopeless skein


who hath not prudencewhat was it i said
of her who paints her eyes and tires her head
and gibes and mocks the people in the street
and fawns upon them for her thriftless bread


accursed is she of eves daughtersshe
hath cast off prudence and her end shall be
destruction brethren of your bounty
some portion of your daily bread to me


a muchdiscerning public hold
the singer generally sings
of personal and private things
and prints and sells his past for gold


whatever i may here disclaim
the very clever folk i sing to
will most indubitably cling to
their pet delusion just the same


i had seen as the dawn was breaking
and i staggered to my rest
tari devi softly shaking
from the cart road to the crest
i had seen the spurs of jakko
heave and quiver swell and sink
was it earthquake or tobacco
day of doom or night of drink


in the full fresh fragrant morning
i observed a camel crawl
laws of gravitation scorning
on the ceiling and the wall
then i watched a fender walking
and i heard grey leeches sing
and a redhot monkey talking
did not seem the proper thing


then a creature skinned and crimson
ran about the floor and cried
and they said that i had the jims on
and they dosed me with bromide
and they locked me in my bedroom
me and one wee blood red mouse
though i said to give my head room
you had best unroof the house


but my words were all unheeded
though i told the grave md
that the treatment really needed
was a dip in open sea
that was lapping just below me
smooth as silver white as snow
and it took three men to throw me
when i found i could not go


half the night i watched the heavens
fizz like h a champagne
fly to sixes and to sevens
wheel and thunder back again
and when all was peace and order
save one planet nailed askew
much i wept because my warder
would not let me set it true


after frenzied hours of waiting
when the earth and skies were dumb
pealed an awful voice dictating
an interminable sum
changing to a tangle story
what she said you said i said
till the moon arose in glory
and i found her in my head


then a face came blind and weeping
and it couldnt wipe its eyes
and it muttered i was keeping
back the moonlight from the skies
so i patted it for pity
but it whistled shrill with wrath
and a huge black devil city
poured its peoples on my path


so i fled with steps uncertain
on a thousandyear long race
but the bellying of the curtain
kept me always in one place
while the tumult rose and maddened
to the roar of earth on fire
ere it ebbed and sank and saddened
to a whisper tense as wire


in tolerable stillness
rose one little little star
and it chuckled at my illness
and it mocked me from afar
and its brethren came and eyed me
called the universe to aid
till i lay with naught to hide me
neath the scorn of all things made


dun and saffron robed and splendid
broke the solemn pitying day
and i knew my pains were ended
and i turned and tried to pray
but my speech was shattered wholly
and i wept as children weep
till the dawnwind softly slowly
brought to burning eyelids sleep


i go to concert party ball
what profit is in these
i sit alone against the wall
and strive to look at ease


the incense that is mine by right
they burn before her shrine
and thats because im seventeen
and she is fortynine


i cannot check my girlish blush
my color comes and goes
i redden to my fingertips
and sometimes to my nose


but she is white where white should be
and red where red should shine
the blush that flies at seventeen
is fixed at fortynine


i wish i had her constant cheek
i wish that i could sing
all sorts of funny little songs
not quite the proper thing


im very gauche and very shy
her jokes arent in my line
and worst of all im seventeen
while she is fortynine


the young men come the young men go
each pink and white and neat
shes older than their mothers but
they grovel at her feet


they walk beside her rickshaw wheels
none ever walk by mine
and thats because im seventeen
and she is fortynine


she rides with half a dozen men
she calls them boys and mashers
i trot along the mall alone
my prettiest frocks and sashes
dont help to fill my programmecard
and vainly i repine
from ten to two am ah me
would i were fortynine


she calls me darling pet and dear
and sweet retiring maid
im always at the back i know
she puts me in the shade


she introduces me to men
cast lovers i opine
for sixty takes to seventeen
nineteen to fortynine


but even she must older grow
and end her dancing days
she cant go on forever so
at concerts balls and plays


one ray of priceless hope i see
before my footsteps shine
just think that shell be eightyone
when i am fortynine


eyes of greya sodden quay
driving rain and falling tears
as the steamer wears to sea
in a parting storm of cheers


sing for faith and hope are high
none so true as you and i
sing the lovers litany
love like ours can never die


eyes of blacka throbbing keel
milky foam to left and right
whispered converse near the wheel
in the brilliant tropic night


cross that rules the southern sky
stars that sweep and wheel and fly
hear the lovers litany
love like ours can never die


eyes of browna dusty plain
split and parched with heat of june
flying hoof and tightened rein
hearts that beat the old old tune


side by side the horses fly
frame we now the old reply
of the lovers litany
love like ours can never die


eyes of bluethe simla hills
silvered with the moonlight hoar
pleading of the waltz that thrills
dies and echoes round benmore


mabel officers goodbye
glamour wine and witchery
on my souls sincerity
love like ours can never die


maidens of your charity
pity my most luckless state
four times cupids debtor i
bankrupt in quadruplicate


if down here i chance to die
solemnly i beg you take
all that is left of i
to the hills for old sakes sake
pack me very thoroughly
in the ice that used to slake
pegs i drank when i was dry
this observe for old sakes sake


to the railway station hie
there a single ticket take
for umballagoodstraini
shall not mind delay or shake
i shall rest contentedly
spite of clamor coolies make
thus in state and dignity
send me up for old sakes sake


next the sleepy babu wake
book a kalka van for four
few i think will care to make
journeys with me any more
as they used to do of yore
i shall need a special break
thing i never took before
get me one for old sakes sake


after thatarrangements make
no hotel will take me in
and a bullocks back would break
neath the teak and leaden skin
tonga ropes are frail and thin
or did i a backseat take
in a tonga i might spin
do your best for old sakes sake


after thatyour work is done
recollect a padre must
mourn the dear departed one
throw the ashes and the dust
dont go down at once i trust
you will find excuse to snake
three days casual on the bust
get your fun for old sakes sake


i could never stand the plains
think of blazing june and may
think of those september rains
yearly till the judgment day
i should never rest in peace
i should sweat and lie awake
rail me then on my decease
to the hills for old sakes sake


it was an artless bandar and he danced upon a pine
and much i wondered how he lived and where the beast might dine
and many many other things till oer my morning smoke
i slept the sleep of idleness and dreamt that bandar spoke


he said o man of many clothes sad crawler on the hills
observe i know not rankens shop nor rankens monthly bills
i take no heed to trousers or the coats that you call dress
nor am i plagued with little cards for little drinks at mess


i steal the bunnias grain at morn at noon and eventide
for he is fat and i am spare i roam the mountain side
i follow no mans carriage and no never in my life
have i flirted at pelitis with another bandars wife


o man of futile fopperiesunnecessary wraps
i own no ponies in the hills i drive no tallwheeled traps
i buy me not twelvebutton gloves shortsixes eke or rings
nor do i waste at hamiltons my wealth on pretty things


i quarrel with my wife at home we never fight abroad
but mrs b has grasped the fact i am her only lord
i never heard of feverdumps nor debts depress my soul
and i pity and despise you here he poached my breakfastroll


his hide was very mangy and his face was very red
and ever and anon he scratched with energy his head
his manners were not always nice but how my spirit cried
to be an artless bandar loose upon the mountain side


so i answered gentle bandar an inscrutable decree
makes thee a gleesome fleasome thou and me a wretched me
go depart in peace my brother to thy home amid the pine
yet forget not once a mortal wished to change his lot for thine


before the beginning of years
there came to the rule of the state
men with a pair of shears
men with an estimate
strachey with muir for leaven
lytton with locks that fell
ripon fooling with heaven
and temple riding like hell
and the bigots took in hand
cess and the falling of rain
and the measure of sifted sand
the dealer puts in the grain
imports by land and sea
to uttermost decimal worth
and registrationfree
in the houses of death and of birth


and fashioned with pens and paper
and fashioned in black and white
with life for a flickering taper
and death for a blazing light
with the armed and the civil power
that his strength might endure for a span
from adams bridge to peshawur
the much administered man


in the towns of the north and the east
they gathered as unto rule
they bade him starve his priest
and send his children to school


railways and roads they wrought
for the needs of the soil within
a time to squabble in court
a time to bear and to grin


and gave him peace in his ways
jailsand police to fight
justiceat length of days
and rightand might in the right


his speech is of mortgaged bedding
on his kine he borrows yet
at his heart is his daughters wedding
in his eye foreknowledge of debt


he eats and hath indigestion
he toils and he may not stop
his life is a longdrawn question
between a crop and a crop


jane austen beecher stowe de rouse
was good beyond all earthly need
but on the other hand her spouse
was very very bad indeed
he smoked cigars called churches slow
and racedbut this she did not know


for belial machiavelli kept
the little fact a secret and
though oer his minor sins she wept
jane austen did not understand
that lillythirteentwo and bay
absorbed onehalf her husbands pay


she was so good she made him worse
some women are like this i think
he taught her parrot how to curse
her assam monkey how to drink
he vexed her righteous soul until
she went up and he went down hill


then came the crisis strange to say
which turned a good wife to a better
a telegraphic peon one day
brought hernow had it been a letter
for belial machiavelli i
know jane would just have let it lie


but twas a telegram instead
marked urgent and her duty plain
to open it jane austen read
your lillys got a cough again
cant understand why she is kept
at your expense jane austen wept


it was a misdirected wire
her husband was at shaitanpore
she spread her anger hot as fire
through six thin foreign sheets or more
sent off that letter wrote another
to her solicitorand mother


then belial machiavelli saw
her error and i trust his own
wired to the minion of the law
and traveled wifewardnot alone
for lillythirteentwo and bay
came in a horsebox all the way


there was a scenea weep or two
with many kisses austen jane
rode lilly all the season through
and never opened wires again
she races now with belial this
is very sad but so it is


ay lay him neath the simla pine
a fortnight fully to be missed
behold we lose our fourth at whist
a chair is vacant where we dine


his place forgets him other men
have bought his ponies guns and traps
his fortune is the great perhaps
and that cool resthouse down the glen


whence he shall hear as spirits may
our mundane revel on the height
shall watch each flashing rickshawlight
sweep on to dinner dance and play


benmore shall woo him to the ball
with lighted rooms and braying band
and he shall hear and understand
dream faces better than us all


for think you as the vapours flee
across sanjaolie after rain
his soul may climb the hill again
to each field of victory


unseen who women held so dear
the strong mans yearning to his kind
shall shake at most the windowblind
or dull awhile the cardrooms cheer


in his own place of power unknown
his light o love anothers flame
his dearest pony galloped lame
and he an alien and alone


yet may he meet with many a friend
shrewd shadows lingering long unseen
among us when god save the queen
shows even extras have an end


and when we leave the heated room
and when at four the lights expire
the crew shall gather round the fire
and mock our laughter in the gloom


talk as we talked and they ere death
flirt wanly dance in ghostlywise
with ghosts of tunes for melodies
and vanish at the mornings breath


dim dawn behind the tamarisksthe sky is saffronyellow
as the women in the village grind the corn
and the parrots seek the riverside each calling to his fellow
that the day the staring easter day is born


oh the white dust on the highway oh the stenches in the byway
oh the clammy fog that hovers oer the earth
and at home theyre making merry neath the white and scarlet berry
what part have indias exiles in their mirth


full day behind the tamarisksthe sky is blue and staring
as the cattle crawl afield beneath the yoke
and they bear one oer the fieldpath who is past all hope or caring
to the ghat below the curling wreaths of smoke


call on rama going slowly as ye bear a brother lowly
call on ramahe may hear perhaps your voice
with our hymnbooks and our psalters we appeal to other altars
and today we bid good christian men rejoice


high noon behind the tamarisksthe sun is hot above us
as at home the christmas day is breaking wan
they will drink our healths at dinnerthose who tell us how they love us
and forget us till another year be gone


oh the toil that knows no breaking oh the heimweh ceaseless aching
oh the black dividing sea and alien plain
youth was cheapwherefore we sold it
gold was goodwe hoped to hold it
and today we know the fulness of our gain


grey dusk behind the tamarisksthe parrots fly together
as the sun is sinking slowly over home
and his last ray seems to mock us shackled in a lifelong tether
that drags us back howeer so far we roam


hard her service poor her paymentshe is ancient tattered raiment
india she the grim stepmother of our kind
if a year of life be lent her if her temples shrine we enter
the door is shutwe may not look behind


black night behind the tamarisksthe owls begin their chorus
as the conches from the temple scream and bray
with the fruitless years behind us and the hopeless years before us
let us honor o my brother christmas day


call a truce then to our laborslet us feast with friends and neighbors
and be merry as the custom of our caste
for if faint and forced the laughter and if sadness follow after
we are richer by one mocking christmas past


the toad beneath the harrow knows
exactly where each toothpoint goes
the butterfly upon the road
preaches contentment to that toad


pagett mp was a liar and a fluent liar therewith
he spoke of the heat of india as the asian solar myth
came on a four months visit to study the east in november
and i got him to sign an agreement vowing to stay till september


march came in with the koil pagett was cool and gay
called me a bloated brahmin talked of my princely pay
march went out with the roses where is your heat said he
coming said i to pagett skittles said pagett mp


april began with the punkah coolies and pricklyheat
pagett was dear to mosquitoes sandflies found him a treat
he grew speckled and mumpyhammered i grieve to say
aryan brothers who fanned him in an illiberal way


may set in with a duststormpagett went down with the sun
all the delights of the season tickled him one by one
imprimisten days liverdue to his drinking beer
later a dose of feverslight but he called it severe


dysentry touched him in june after the chota bursat
lowered his portly personmade him yearn to depart
he didnt call me a brahmin or bloated or overpaid
but seemed to think it a wonder that any one stayed


july was a trifle unhealthypagett was ill with fear
called it the cholera morbus hinted that life was dear
he babbled of eastern exile and mentioned his home with tears
but i havent seen my children for close upon seven years


we reached a hundred and twenty once in the court at noon
ive mentioned pagett was portly pagett went off in a swoon
that was an end to the business pagett the perjured fled
with a practical working knowledge of solar myths in his head


and i laughed as i drove from the station but the mirth died out on my lips
as i thought of the fools like pagett who write of their eastern trips
and the sneers of the traveled idiots who duly misgovern the land
and i prayed to the lord to deliver another one into my hand


how shall she know the worship we would do her
the walls are high and she is very far
how shall the womans message reach unto her
above the tumult of the packed bazaar
free wind of march against the lattice blowing
bear thou our thanks lest she depart unknowing


go forth across the fields we may not roam in
go forth beyond the trees that rim the city
to whatsoeer fair place she hath her home in
who dowered us with wealth of love and pity
out of our shadow pass and seek her singing
i have no gifts but love alone for bringing


say that we be a feeble folk who greet her
but old in grief and very wise in tears
say that we being desolate entreat her
that she forget us not in after years
for we have seen the light and it were grievous
to dim that dawning if our lady leave us


by life that ebbed with none to stanch the failing
by loves sad harvest garnered in the spring
when love in ignorance wept unavailing
oer young buds dead before their blossoming
by all the grey owl watched the pale moon viewed
in past grim years declare our gratitude


by hands uplifted to the gods that heard not
by fits that found no favor in their sight
by faces bent above the babe that stirred not
by nameless horrors of the stifling night
by ills foredone by peace her toils discover
bid earth be good beneath and heaven above her


if she have sent her servants in our pain
if she have fought with death and dulled his sword
if she have given back our sick again
and to the breast the waking lips restored
is it a little thing that she has wrought
then life and death and motherhood be nought


go forth o wind our message on thy wings
and they shall hear thee pass and bid thee speed
in reedroofed hut or whitewalled home of kings
who have been helpen by her in their need
all spring shall give thee fragrance and the wheat
shall be a tasselled floorcloth to thy feet


haste for our hearts are with thee take no rest
loudvoiced ambassador from sea to sea
proclaim the blessing manifold confessed
of those in darkness by her hand set free
then very softly to her presence move
and whisper lady lo they know and love


one moment bid the horses wait
since tiffin is not laid till three
below the upward path and straight
you climbed a year ago with me
love came upon us suddenly
and loosedan idle hour to kill
a headless armless armory
that smote us both on jakko hill


ah heaven we would wait and wait
through time and to eternity
ah heaven we could conquer fate
with more than godlike constancy
i cut the date upon a tree
here stand the clumsy figures still
ad
damp with the mist of jakko hill


what came of high resolve and great
and until death fidelity
whose horse is waiting at your gate
whose rickshawwheels ride over me
no saints i swear andlet me see
tonight what names your programme fill
we drift asunder merrily
as drifts the mist on jakko hill


princess behold our ancient state
has clean departed and we see
twas idleness we took for fate
that bound light bonds on you and me
amen here ends the comedy
where it began in all good will
since love and leave together flee
as driven mist on jakko hill


too late alas the song
to remedy the wrong
the rooms are taken from us swept and garnished for their fate
but these tearbesprinkled pages
shall attest to future ages
that we cried against the crime of it too late alas too late


what have we ever done to bear this grudge
was there no room save only in benmore
for docket duftar and for office drudge
that you usurp our smoothest dancing floor
must babus do their work on polished teak
are ballrooms fittest for the ink you spill
was there no other cheaper house to seek
you might have left them all at strawberry hill


we never harmed you innocent our guise
dainty our shining feet our voices low
and we revolved to divers melodies
and we were happy but a year ago
tonight the moon that watched our lightsome wiles
that beamed upon us through the deodars
is wan with gazing on official files
and desecrating desks disgust the stars


nay by the memory of tuneful nights
nay by the witchery of flying feet
nay by the glamour of foredone delights
by all things merry musical and meet
by wine that sparkled and by sparkling eyes
by wailing waltzby reckless galops strain
by dim verandas and by soft replies
give us our ravished ballroom back again


orhearken to the curse we lay on you
the ghosts of waltzes shall perplex your brain
and murmurs of past merriment pursue
your wildered clerks that they indite in vain
and when you count your poor provincial millions
the only figures that your pen shall frame
shall be the figures of dear dear cotillions
danced out in tumult long before you came


yea see saw shall upset your estimates
dream faces shall your heavy heads bemuse
because your hand unheeding desecrates
our temple fit for higher worthier use
and all the long verandas eloquent
with echoes of a score of simla years
shall plague you with unbidden sentiment
babbling of kisses laughter love and tears


so shall you mazed amid old memories stand
so shall you toil and shall accomplish nought
and ever in your ears a phantom band
shall blare away the staid official thought
whereforeand ere this awful curse he spoken
cast out your swarthy sacrilegious train
and giveere dancing cease and hearts be broken
give us our ravished ballroom back again


that night when through the mooringchains
the wideeyed corpse rolled free
to blunder down by garden reach
and rot at kedgeree
the tale the hughli told the shoal
the lean shoal told to me


t was fultah fishers boardinghouse
where sailormen reside
and there were men of all the ports
from mississip to clyde
and regally they spat and smoked
and fearsomely they lied


they lied about the purple sea
that gave them scanty bread
they lied about the earth beneath
the heavens overhead
for they had looked too often on
black rum when that was red


they told their tales of wreck and wrong
of shame and lust and fraud
they backed their toughest statements with
the brimstone of the lord
and crackling oaths went to and fro
across the fistbanged board


and there was hans the blueeyed dane
bullthroated bare of arm
who carried on his hairy chest
the maid ultrudas charm
the little silver crucifix
that keeps a man from harm


and there was jake withouttheears
and pamba the malay
and carboy gin the guinea cook
and luz from vigo bay
and honest jack who sold them slops
and harvested their pay


and there was salem hardieker
a lean bostonian he
russ german english halfbreed finn
yank dane and portuguee
at fultah fishers boardinghouse
they rested from the sea


now anne of austria shared their drinks
collinga knew her fame
from tarnau in galicia
to juan bazaar she came
to eat the bread of infamy
and take the wage of shame


she held a dozen men to heel
rich spoil of war was hers
in hose and gown and ring and chain
from twenty mariners
and by port law that week men called
her salem hardiekers


but seamen learntwhat landsmen know
that neither gifts nor gain
can hold a winking light o love
or fancys flight restrain
when anne of austria rolled her eyes
on hans the blueeyed dane


since life is strife and strife means knife
from howrah to the bay
and he may die before the dawn
who liquored out the day
in fultah fishers boardinghouse
we woo while yet we may


but cold was hans the blueeyed dane
bullthroated bare of arm
and laughter shook the chest beneath
the maid ultrudas charm
the little silver crucifix
that keeps a man from harm


you speak to salem hardieker
you was his girl i know
i ship mineselfs tomorrow see
und round the skaw we go
south down the cattegat by hjelm
to besser in saro


when love rejected turns to hate
all ill betide the man
you speak to salem hardieker
she spoke as woman can
a screama sobhe called menames
and then the fray began


an oath from salem hardieker
a shriek upon the stairs
a dance of shadows on the wall
a knifethrust unawares
and hans came down as cattle drop
across the broken chairs


in anne of austrias trembling hands
the weary head fell low
i ship mineselfs tomorrow straight
for besser in saro
und there ultruda comes to me
at easter und i go


south down the cattegatwhats here

the mutter ceased the spirit passed
and anne of austria cried
in fultah fishers boardinghouse
when hans the mighty died


thus slew they hans the blueeyed dane
bullthroated bare of arm
but anne of austria looted first
the maid ultrudas charm
the little silver crucifix
that keeps a man from harm


so long as neath the kalka hills
the tongahorn shall ring
so long as down the solon dip
the hardheld ponies swing
so long as tara devi sees
the lights of simla town
so long as pleasure calls us up
or duty drives us down
if you love me as i love you
what pair so happy as we two


so long as aces take the king
or backers take the bet
so long as debt leads men to wed
or marriage leads to debt
so long as little luncheons love
and scandal hold their vogue
while there is sport at annandale
or whisky at jutogh
if you love me as i love you
what knife can cut our love in two


so long as down the rocking floor
the raving polka spins
so long as kitchen lancers spur
the maddened violins
so long as through the whirling smoke
we hear the ofttold tale
twelve hundred in the lotteries
and whatshername for sale
if you love me as i love you
well play the game and win it too


so long as lust or lucre tempt
straight riders from the course
so long as with each drink we pour
black brewage of remorse
so long as those unloaded guns
we keep beside the bed
blow off by obvious accident
the lucky owners head
if you love me as i love you
what can life kill or death undo


so long as death twixt dance and dance
chills best and bravest blood
and drops the reckless rider down
the rotten rainsoaked khud
so long as rumours from the north
make loving wives afraid
so long as burma takes the boy
or typhoid kills the maid
if you love me as i love you
what knife can cut our love in two


by all that lights our daily life
or works our lifelong woe
from boileaugunge to simla downs
and those grim glades below
where heedless of the flying hoof
and clamour overhead
sleep with the grey langur for guard
our very scornful dead
if you love me as i love you
all earth is servant to us two


by docket billetdoux and file
by mountain cliff and fir
by fan and sword and officebox
by corset plume and spur
by riot revel waltz and war
by women work and bills
by all the life that fizzes in
the everlasting hills
if you love me as i love you
what pair so happy as we two

theres a widow in sleepy chester
who weeps for her only son
theres a grave on the pabeng river
a grave that the burmans shun
and theres subadar prag tewarri
who tells how the work was done


a snider squibbed in the jungle
somebody laughed and fled
and the men of the first shikaris
picked up their subaltern dead
with a big blue mark in his forehead
and the back blown out of his head


subadar prag tewarri
jemadar hira lal
took command of the party
twenty rifles in all
marched them down to the river
as the day was beginning to fall


they buried the boy by the river
a blanket over his face
they wept for their dead lieutenant
the men of an alien race
they made a samadh in his honor
a mark for his restingplace


for they swore by the holy water
they swore by the salt they ate
that the soul of lieutenant eshmitt sahib
should go to his god in state
with fifty file of burman
to open him heavens gate


the men of the first shikaris
marched till the break of day
till they came to the rebel village
the village of pabengmay
a jingal covered the clearing
calthrops hampered the way


subadar prag tewarri
bidding them load with ball
halted a dozen rifles
under the village wall
sent out a flankingparty
with jemadar hira lal


the men of the first shikaris
shouted and smote and slew
turning the grinning jingal
on to the howling crew
the jemadars flankingparty
butchered the folk who flew


long was the morn of slaughter
long was the list of slain
five score heads were taken
five score heads and twain
and the men of the first shikaris
went back to their grave again


each man bearing a basket
red as his palms that day
red as the blazing village
the village of pabengmay
and the dripdripdrip from the baskets
reddened the grass by the way


they made a pile of their trophies
high as a tall mans chin
head upon head distorted
set in a sightless grin
anger and pain and terror
stamped on the smokescorched skin


subadar prag tewarri
put the head of the boh
on the top of the mound of triumph
the head of his son below
with the sword and the peacockbanner
that the world might behold and know


thus the samadh was perfect
thus was the lesson plain
of the wrath of the first shikaris
the price of a white man slain
and the men of the first shikaris
went back into camp again


then a silence came to the river
a hush fell over the shore
and bohs that were brave departed
and sniders squibbed no more
for the burmans said
that a kullahs head
must be paid for with heads five score


theres a widow in sleepy chester
who weeps for her only son
theres a grave on the pabeng river
a grave that the burmans shun
and theres subadar prag tewarri
who tells how the work was done


beneath the deep verandas shade
when bats begin to fly
i sit me down and watchalas
another evening die
bloodred behind the sere ferash
she rises through the haze
sainted diana can that be
the moon of other days


ah shade of little kitty smith
sweet saint of kensington
say was it ever thus at home
the moon of august shone
when arm in arm we wandered long
through putneys evening haze
and hammersmith was heaven beneath
the moon of other days


but wandles stream is sutlej now
and putneys evening haze
the dust that half a hundred kine
before my window raise
unkempt unclean athwart the mist
the seething city looms
in place of putneys golden gorse
the sickly babul blooms


glare down old hecate through the dust
and bid the piedog yell
draw from the drain its typhoidgerm
from each bazaar its smell
yea suck the fever from the tank
and sap my strength therewith
thank heaven you show a smiling face
to little kitty smith


in the name of the empress of india make way
o lords of the jungle wherever you roam
the woods are astir at the close of the day
we exiles are waiting for letters from home
let the robber retreatlet the tiger turn tail
in the name of the empress the overland mail


with a jingle of bells as the dusk gathers in
he turns to the footpath that heads up the hill
the bags on his back and a cloth round his chin
and tucked in his waistbelt the post office bill
despatched on this date as received by the rail
per runner two bags of the overland mail


is the torrent in spate he must ford it or swim
has the rain wrecked the road he must climb by the cliff
does the tempest cry halt what are tempests to him
the service admits not a but or and if
while the breaths in his mouth he must bear without fail
in the name of the empress the overland mail


from aloe to roseoak from roseoak to fir
from level to upland from upland to crest
from ricefield to rockridge from rockridge to spur
fly the soft sandalled feet strains the brawny brown chest
from rail to ravineto the peak from the vale
up up through the night goes the overland mail


theres a speck on the hillside a dot on the road
a jingle of bells on the footpath below
theres a scuffle above in the monkeys abode
the world is awake and the clouds are aglow
for the great sun himself must attend to the hail
in the name of the empress the overland mail


by the well where the bullocks go
silent and blind and slow
by the field where the young corn dies
in the face of the sultry skies


they have heard as the dull earth hears
the voice of the wind of an hour
the sound of the great queens voice
my god hath given me years
hath granted dominion and power
and i bid you o land rejoice


and the ploughman settles the share
more deep in the grudging clod
for he saith the wheat is my care
and the rest is the will of god


he sent the mahratta spear
as he sendeth the rain
and the mlech in the fated year
broke the spear in twain


and was broken in turn who knows
how our lords make strife
it is good that the young wheat grows
for the bread is life


then far and near as the twilight drew
hissed up to the scornful dark
great serpents blazing of red and blue
that rose and faded and rose anew
that the land might wonder and mark


today is a day of days they said
make merry o people all
and the ploughman listened and bowed his head
today and tomorrow gods will he said
as he trimmed the lamps on the wall


he sendeth us years that are good
as he sendeth the dearth
he giveth to each man his food
or her food to the earth


our kings and our queens are afar
on their peoples be peace
god bringeth the rain to the bar
that our cattle increase


and the ploughman settled the share
more deep in the sundried clod
mogul mahratta and mlech from the north
and white queen over the seas
god raiseth them up and driveth them forth
as the dust of the ploughshare flies in the breeze
but the wheat and the cattle are all my care
and the rest is the will of god


the eldest son bestrides him
and the pretty daughter rides him
and i meet him oft o mornings on the course
and there kindles in my bosom
an emotion chill and gruesome
as i canter past the undertakers horse


neither shies he nor is restive
but a hideously suggestive
trot professional and placid he affects
and the cadence of his hoofbeats
to my mind this grim reproof beats
mend your pace my friend im coming whos the next


ah studbred of illomen
i have watched the strongest gomen
of pith and might and muscleat your heels
down the plantainbordered highway
heaven send it neer be my way
in a lacquered box and jetty upon wheels


answer sombre beast and dreary
where is brown the young the cheery
smith the pride of all his friends and half the force
you were at that last dread dak
we must cover at a walk
bring them back to me o undertakers horse


with your mane unhogged and flowing
and your curious way of going
and that businesslike black crimping of your tail
een with beauty on your back sir
pacing as a ladys hack sir
what wonder when i meet you i turn pale


it may be you wait your time beast
till i write my last bad rhyme beast
quit the sunlight cut the rhyming drop the glass
follow after with the others
where some dusky heathen smothers
us with marigolds in lieu of english grass


or perchance in years to follow
i shall watch your plump sides hollow
see carnifex gone lame become a corse
see old age at last oerpower you
and the station pack devour you
i shall chuckle then o undertakers horse


but to insult jibe and quest ive
still the hideously suggestive
trot that hammers out the unrelenting text
and i hear it hard behind me
in what place soeer i find me
sure to catch you sooner or later whos the next


this fell when dinnertime was done
twixt the first an the second rub
that oor mon jock cam hame again
to his rooms ahist the club


an syne he laughed an syne he sang
an syne we thocht him fou
an syne he trumped his partners trick
an garred his partner rue


then up and spake an elder mon
that held the spade its ace
god save the lad whence comes the licht
that wimples on his face


an jock he sniggered an jock he smiled
an ower the cardbrim wunk
im a too fresh fra the stirruppeg
may be that i am drunk


theres whusky brewed in galashils
an l l l forbye
but never liquor lit the lowe
that keeks fra oot your eye


theres a third o hair on your dresscoat breast
aboon the heart a wee
oh that is fra the langhaired skye
that slobbers ower me


oh langhaired skyes are lovin beasts
an terrier dogs are fair
but never yet was terrier born
wi elllang gowden hair


theres a smirch o pouther on your breast
below the left lappel
oh that is fra my auld cigar
whenas the stumpend fell


mon jock ye smoke the trichi coarse
for ye are short o cash
an best havanas couldna leave
sae white an pure an ash


this nicht ye stopped a story braid
an stopped it wi a curse
last nicht ye told that tale yoursel
an capped it wi a worse


oh were no fou oh were no fou
but plainly we can ken
yere fallin fallin fra the band
o cantie single men


an it fell when sirrisshaws were sere
an the nichts were lang and mirk
in braw new breeks wi a gowden ring
oor jock gaed to the kirk


a great and glorious thing it is
to learn for seven years or so
the lord knows what of that and this
ere reckoned fit to face the foe
the flying bullet down the pass
that whistles clear all flesh is grass


three hundred pounds per annum spent
on making brain and body meeter
for all the murderous intent
comprised in villainous saltpetre
and afterask the yusufzaies
what comes of all our ologies


a scrimmage in a border station
a canter down some dark defile
two thousand pounds of education
drops to a tenrupee jezail
the crammers boast the squadrons pride
shot like a rabbit in a ride


no proposition euclid wrote
no formulae the textbooks know
will turn the bullet from your coat
or ward the tulwars downward blow
strike hard who caresshoot straight who can
the odds are on the cheaper man


one swordknot stolen from the camp
will pay for all the school expenses
of any kurrum valley scamp
who knows no word of moods and tenses
but being blessed with perfect sight
picks off our messmates left and right


with homebred hordes the hillsides teem
the troopships bring us one by one
at vast expense of time and steam
to slay afridis where they run
the captives of our bow and spear
are cheapalas as we are dear


open the old cigarbox get me a cuba stout
for things are running crossways and maggie and i are out


we quarrelled about havanaswe fought oer a good cheroot
and i knew she is exacting and she says i am a brute


open the old cigarboxlet me consider a space
in the soft blue veil of the vapour musing on maggies face


maggie is pretty to look atmaggies a loving lass
but the prettiest cheeks must wrinkle the truest of loves must pass


theres peace in a larranaga theres calm in a henry clay
but the best cigar in an hour is finished and thrown away


thrown away for another as perfect and ripe and brown
but i could not throw away maggie for fear o the talk o the town


maggie my wife at fiftygrey and dour and old
with never another maggie to purchase for love or gold


and the light of days that have been the dark of the days that are
and loves torch stinking and stale like the butt of a dead cigar


the butt of a dead cigar you are bound to keep in your pocket
with never a new one to light tho its charred and black to the socket


open the old cigarboxlet me consider a while
here is a mild manilathere is a wifely smile


which is the better portionbondage bought with a ring
or a harem of dusky beauties fifty tied in a string


counsellors cunning and silentcomforters true and tried
and never a one of the fifty to sneer at a rival bride


thought in the early morning solace in time of woes
peace in the hush of the twilight balm ere my eyelids close


this will the fifty give me asking nought in return
with only a suttees passionto do their duty and burn


this will the fifty give me when they are spent and dead
five times other fifties shall be my servants instead


the furrows of faroff java the isles of the spanish main
when they hear my harem is empty will send me my brides again


i will take no heed to their raiment nor food for their mouths withal
so long as the gulls are nesting so long as the showers fall


i will scent em with best vanilla with tea will i temper their hides
and the moor and the mormon shall envy who read of the tale of my brides


for maggie has written a letter to give me my choice between
the wee little whimpering love and the great god nick o teen


and i have been servant of love for barely a twelvemonth clear
but i have been priest of cabanas a matter of seven year


and the gloom of my bachelor days is flecked with the cheery light
of stumps that i burned to friendship and pleasure and work and fight


and i turn my eyes to the future that maggie and i must prove
but the only light on the marshes is the willothewisp of love


will it see me safe through my journey or leave me bogged in the mire
since a puff of tobacco can cloud it shall i follow the fitful fire


open the old cigarboxlet me consider anew
old friends and who is maggie that i should abandon you


a million surplus maggies are willing to bear the yoke
and a woman is only a woman but a good cigar is a smoke


light me another cubai hold to my firstsworn vows
if maggie will have no rival ill have no maggie for spouse


where the sobercolored cultivator smiles
on his byles
where the cholera the cyclone and the crow
come and go
where the merchant deals in indigo and tea
hides and ghi
where the babu drops inflammatory hints
in his prints
stands a citycharnock chose itpacked away
near a bay
by the sewage rendered fetid by the sewer
made impure
by the sunderbunds unwholesome by the swamp
moist and damp
and the city and the viceroy as we see
dont agree


once two hundred years ago the trader came
meek and tame


where his timid foot first halted there he stayed
till mere trade
grew to empire and he sent his armies forth
south and north
till the country from peshawur to ceylon
was his own


thus the midday halt of charnockmores the pity
grew a city


as the fungus sprouts chaotic from its bed
so it spread
chancedirected chanceerected laid and built
on the silt
palace byre hovelpoverty and pride
side by side
and above the packed and pestilential town
death looked down


but the rulers in that city by the sea
turned to flee
fled with each returning springtide from its ills
to the hills


from the clammy fogs of morning from the blaze
of old days
from the sickness of the noontide from the heat
beat retreat
for the country from peshawur to ceylon
was their own


but the merchant risked the perils of the plain
for his gain


now the restingplace of charnock neath the palms
asks an alms
and the burden of its lamentation is
briefly this
because for certain months we boil and stew
so should you


cast the viceroy and his council to perspire
in our fire
and for answer to the argument in vain
we explain
that an amateur saint lawrence cannot fry
all must fry
that the merchant risks the perils of the plain
for gain


nor can rulers rule a house that men grow rich in
from its kitchen


let the babu drop inflammatory hints
in his prints
and matureconsistent soulhis plan for stealing
to darjeeling
let the merchant seek who makes his silver pile
englands isle
let the city charnock pitched onevil day
go her way


though the argosies of asia at her doors
heap their stores
though her enterprise and energy secure
income sure
though outstation orders punctually obeyed
swell her trade
still for rule administration and the rest
simlas best


i that obscured have fled the scene of fame
intitling my conceits to nought but care
i that have lived a phoenix in loves flame
and felt that death i never would declare
now mount the theater of this our age
to plead my faith and cupids cursed rage


oh you high sprited paragons of wit
that fly to fame beyond our earthly pitch
whose sense is sound whose words are feat and fit
able to make the coyest ear to itch
shroud with your mighty wings that mount so well
these little loves new crept from out the shell


and thou the true octavia of our time
under whose worth beauty was never matched
the genius of my muse and ragged rime
smile on these little loves but lately hatched
who from the wrastling waves have made retreat
to plead for life before thy judgment seat


and though the forebred brothers they have had
who in their swanlike songs amintas wept
for all their sweetthought sighs had fortune bad
and twice obscured in cinthias circle slept
yet these i hope under your kind aspect
most worthy lady shall escape neglect


and if these infants of mine artless brain
not by their worth but by thy worthiness
a mean good liking of the learned gain
my muse enfranchised from forgetfulness
shall hatch such breed in honour of thy name
as modern poets shall admire the same


as modern poets shall admire the same
i mean not you you never matched men
who brought the chaos of our tongue in frame
through these herculean labours of your pen
i mean the mean i mean no men divine
but such whose feathers are but waxed like mine


go weeping trucemen in your sighing weeds
under a great maecenas i have passed you
if so you come where learned colin feeds
his lovely flock pack thence and quickly haste you
you are but mists before so bright a sun
who hath the palm for deep invention won


kiss delias hand for her sweet prophets sake
whose not affected but well couched tears
have power have worth a marble mind to shake
whose fame no ironage or time outwears
then lay you down in phillis lap and sleep
until the weeping read and reading weep


oh pleasing thoughts apprentices of love
forerunners of desire sweet mithridates
the poison of my sorrows to remove
with whom my hopes and fear full oft debates
enrich yourselves and me by your self riches
which are the thoughts you spend on heavenbred beauty
rouse you my muse beyond our poets pitches
and working wonders yet say all is duty
use you no eaglets eyes nor phoenix feathers
to tower the heaven from whence heavens wonder sallies
for why your sun sings sweetly to her weathers
making a spring of winter in the valleys
show to the world though poor and scant my skill is
how sweet thoughts be that are but thought on phillis


you sacred seanymphs pleasantly disporting
amidst this watry world where now i sail
if ever love or lovers sad reporting
had power sweet tears from your fair eyes to hail
and you more gentlehearted than the rest
under the northern noonstead sweetly streaming
lend those moist riches of your crystal crest
to quench the flames from my hearts aetna streaming
and thou kind triton in thy trumpet relish
the ruthful accents of my discontent
that midst this travel desolate and hellish
some gentle wind that listens my lament
may prattle in the north in phillis ears
where phillis wants damon consumes in tears


in fancys world an atlas have i been
where yet the chaos of my ceaseless care
is by her eyes unpitied and unseen
in whom all gifts but pity planted are
for mercy though still cries my moanclad muse
and every paper that she sends to beauty
in tract of sable tears brings woeful news
of my true heartkind thoughts and loyal duty
but ah the strings of her hard heart are strained
beyond the harmony of my desires
and though the happy heavens themselves have pained
to tame her heart whose will so far aspires
yet she who claims the title of worlds wonder
thinks all deserts too base to bring her under


long hath my sufferance laboured to enforce
one pearl of pity from her pretty eyes
whilst i with restless rivers of remorse
have bathed the banks where my fair phillis lies
the moaning lines which weeping i have written
and writing read unto my ruthful sheep
and reading sent with tears that never fitten
to my loves queen that hath my heart in keep
have made my lambkins lay them down and sigh
but phillis sits and reads and calls them trifles
oh heavens why climb not happy lines so high
to rent that ruthless heart that all hearts rifles
none writes with truer faith or greater love
yet out alas i have no power to move


ah pale and dying infant of the spring
how rightly now do i resemble thee
that selfsame hand that thee from stalk did wring
hath rent my breast and robbed my heart from me
yet shalt thou live for why thy native vigour
shall thrive by woeful dewdrops of my dolor
and from the wounds i bear through fancys rigour
my streaming blood shall yield the crimson color
the ravished sighs that ceaseless take their issue
from out the furnace of my heart inflamed
to yield you lasting springs shall never miss you
so by my plaints and pains you shall be famed
let my hearts heat and cold thy crimson nourish
and by my sorrows let thy beauty flourish


it is not death which wretched men call dying
but that is very death which i endure
when my coylooking nymph her grace envying
by fatal frowns my domage doth procure
it is not life which we for life approve
but that is life when on her woolsoft paps
i seal sweet kisses which do batten love
and doubling them do treble my good haps
tis neither love the son nor love the mother
which lovers praise and pray to but that love is
which she in eye and i in heart do smother
then muse not though i glory in my miss
since she who holds my heart and me in durance
hath life death love and all in her procurance


how languisheth the primrose of loves garden
how trill her tears th elixir of my senses
ambitious sickness what doth thee so harden
oh spare and plague thou me for her offences
ah roses loves fair roses do not languish
blush through the milkwhite veil that holds you covered
if heat or cold may mitigate your anguish
ill burn ill freeze but you shall be recovered
good god would beauty mark now she is crased
how but one shower of sickness makes her tender
her judgments then to mark my woes amazed
to mercy should opinions fort surrender
and ioh would i might or would she meant it
should herya love who now in heart lament it


no stars her eyes to clear the wandering night
but shining suns of true divinity
that make the soul conceive her perfect light
no wanton beauties of humanity
her pretty brows but beams that clear the sight
of him that seeks the true philosophy
no coral is her lip no rose her fair
but even that crimson that adorns the sun
no nymph is she but mistress of the air
by whom my glories are but new begun
but when i touch and taste as others do
i then shall write and you shall wonder too


the dewy roseate morn had with her hairs
in sundry sorts the indian clime adorned
and now her eyes apparreled in tears
the loss of lovely memnon long had mourned
when as she spied the nymph whom i admire
combing her locks of which the yellow gold
made blush the beauties of her curled wire
which heaven itself with wonder might behold
then red with shame her reverend locks she rent
and weeping hid the beauty of her face
the flower of fancy wrought such discontent
the sighs which midst the air she breathed a space
a threedays stormy tempest did maintain
her shame a fire her eyes a swelling rain


the rumour runs that here in isis swim
such stately swans so confident in dying
that when they feel themselves near lethes brim
they sing their fatal dirge when death is nighing
and i like these that feel my wounds are mortal
contented die for her whom i adore
and in my joyful hymns do still exhort all
to die for such a saint or love no more
not that my torments or her tyranny
enforce me to enjoin so hard a task
but for i know and yield no reason why
but will them try that have desire to ask
as love hath wreaths his pretty eyes to seel
so lovers must keep secret what they feel


my frail and earthly bark by reasons guide
which holds the helm whilst will doth wield the sail
by my desires the winds of bad betide
hath sailed these worldly seas with small avail
vain objects serve for dreadful rocks to quail
my brittle boat from haven of life that flies
to haunt the sea of mundane miseries
my soul that draws impressions from above
and views my course and sees the winds aspire
bids reason watch to scape the shoals of love
but lawless will enflamed with endless ire
doth steer empoopb whilst reason doth retire
the streams increase loves waves my bark do fill
thus are they wracked that guide their course by will


ah trees why fall your leaves so fast
ah rocks where are your robes of moss
ah flocks why stand you all aghast
trees rocks and flocks what are you pensive for my loss
the birds methinks tune naught but moan
the winds breathe naught but bitter plaint
the beasts forsake their dens to groan
birds winds and beasts what doth my loss your powers attaint
floods weep their springs above their bounds
and echo wails to see my woe
the robe of ruth doth clothe the grounds
floods echo grounds why do you all these tears bestow
the trees the rocks and flocks reply
the birds the winds the beasts report
floods echo grounds for sorrow cry
we grieve since phillis nill kind damons love consort


love guides the roses of thy lips
and flies about them like a bee
if i approach he forward skips
and if i kiss he stingeth me
love in thine eyes doth build his bower
and sleeps within their pretty shine
and if i look the boy will lower
and from their orbs shoots shafts divine
love works thy heart within his fire
and in my tears doth firm the same
and if i tempt it will retire
and of my plaints doth make a game
love let me cull her choicest flowers
and pity me and calm her eye
make soft her heart dissolve her lowers
then will i praise thy deity
but if thou do not love ill truly serve her
in spite of thee and by firm faith deserve her


i wrote in mirrhas bark and as i wrote
poor mirrha wept because i wrote forsaken
twas of thy pride i sung in weeping note
when as her leaves great moan for pity maken
the falling fountains from the mountains falling
cried out alas so fair and be so cruel
and babbling echo never ceased calling
phillis disdain is fit for none but truthless
the rising pines wherein i had engraved
thy memory consulting with the wind
are trucemen to thy heart and thoughts depraved
and say thy kind should not be so unkind
but out alas so fell is phillis fearless
that she hath made her damon well nigh tearless


my phillis hath the morning sun
at first to look upon her
and phillis hath mornwaking birds
her risings for to honour
my phillis hath primefeathered flowers
that smile when she treads on them
and phillis hath a gallant flock
that leaps since she doth own them


but phillis hath so hard a heart
alas that she should have it
as yields no mercy to desert
nor grace to those that crave it
sweet sun when thou lookst on
pray her regard my moan
sweet birds when you sing to her
to yield some pity woo her
sweet flowers whenas she treads on
tell her her beauty deads one
and if in life her love she nill agree me
pray her before i die she will come see me


i part but how from joy from hope from life
i leave but whom loves pride wits pomp hearts bliss
i pine for what for grief for thought for strife
i faint and why because i see my miss
oh ceaseless pains that never may be told
you make me weep as i to water would
ah weary hopes in deep oblivious streams
go seek your graves since you have lost your grounds
ah pensive heart seek out her radiant gleams
for why thy bliss is shut within those bounds


all traitorous eyes too feeble in fore sight
grow dim with woe that now must want your light
i part from bliss to dwell with ceaseless moan
i part from life since i from beauty part
i part from peace to pine in care alone
i part from ease to die with dreadful smart
i partoh death for why this world contains
more care and woe than with despair remains
oh loath depart wherein such sorrows dwell
as all conceits are scant the same to tell


ah fleeting weal ah sly deluding sleep
that in one moment givst me joy and pain
how do my hopes dissolve to tears in vain
as wont the snows fore angry sun to weep
ah noisome life that hath no weal in keep
my forward grief hath form and working might
my pleasures like the shadows take their flight
my path to bliss is tedious long and steep


twice happy thou endymion that embracest
the livelong night thy love within thine arms
where thou fond dream my longed weal defacest
whilst fleeting and uncertain shades thou placest
before my eyes with false deluding charms
ah instant sweets which do my heart revive
how should i joy if you were true alive


as where two raging venoms are united
which of themselves dissevered life would sever
the sickly wretch of sickness is acquited
which else should die or pine in torments ever
so fire and frost that hold my heart in seizure
restore those ruins which themselves have wrought
where if apart they both had had their pleasure
the earth long since her fatal claim had caught
thus two united deaths keep me from dying
i burne in ice and quake amidst the fire
no hope midst these extremes or favour spying
thus love makes me a martyr in his ire
so that both cold and heat do rather feed
my ceaseless pains than any comfort breed


thou tyrannizing monarch that dost tire
my lovesick heart through those assaulting eyes
that are the lamps which lighten my desire
if nought but death thy fury may suffice
not for my peace but for thy pleasure be it
that phillis wrathful phillis that repines me
all grace but death may deign to come and see it
and seeing grieve at that which she assigns me
this only boon for all my mortal bane
i crave and cry for at thy mercy seat
that when her wrath a faithful heart hath slain
and soul is fled and body reft of heat
she might perceive how much she might command
that had my life and death within her hand


some praise the looks and others praise the locks
of their fair queens in love with curious words
some laud the breast where love his treasure locks
all like the eye that life and love affords
but none of these frail beauties and unstable
shall make my pen riot in pompous style
more greater gifts shall my grave muse enable
whereat severer brows shall never smile
i praise her honeysweeter eloquence
which from the fountain of true wisdom floweth
her modest mien that matcheth excellence
her matchless faith which from her virtue groweth
and could my style her happy virtues equal
time had no power her glories to enthral


now scourge of winters wrack is well nigh spent
and sun gins look more longer on our clime
and earth no more to sorrow doth consent
why been thy looks forlorn that view the prime
unneth thy flocks may feed to see thee faint
thou lost they lean and both with woe attaint
for shame cast off these discontented looks
for grief doth wait on life though never sought
so thenot wrote admired for pipe and books
then to the spring attemper thou thy thought
and let advice rear up thy drooping mind
and leave to weep thy woes unto the wind


ah demades no wonder though i wail
for even the spring is winter unto me
look as the sun the earth doth then avail
when by his beams her bowels warmed be
even so a saint more sunbright in her shining
first wrought my weal now hastes my winters pining
which lovely lamp withdrawn from my poor eyes
both parts of earth and fire drowned up in woe
in winter dwell my joy my courage dies
my lambs with me that do my winter know


for pity scorn the spring that nigheth near
and pine to see their masters pining cheer
the root which yieldeth sap unto the tree
draws from the earth the means that make it spring
and by the sap the scions fostered be
all from the sun have comfort and increasing
and that fair eye that lights this earthly ball
kills by depart and nearing cheereth all
as root to tree such is my tender heart
whose sap is thought whose branches are content
and from my soul they draw their sweet or smart
and from her eye my souls best life is lent
which heavenly eye that lights both earth and air
quells by depart and quickens by repair


give period to the process of thy plaint
unhappy damon witty in selfgrieving
tend thou thy flocks let tyrant love attaint
those tender hearts that made their love their living
and as kind time keeps phillis from thy sight
so let prevention banish fancy quite


cast hence this idle fuel of desire
that feeds that flame wherein thy heart consumeth
let reason school thy will which doth aspire
and counsel cool impatience that presumeth
drive hence vain thoughts which are fond loves abettors
for he that seeks his thraldom merits fetters


the vain idea of this deity
nursed at the teat of thine imagination
was bred brought up by thine own vanity
whose being thou mayst curse from the creation
and so thou list thou may as soon forget love
as thou at first didst fashion and beget love


peace demades peace shepherd do not tempt me
the sagetaught wife may speak thus but not practise
rather from life than from my love exempt me
my happy love wherein my weal and wrack lies
where chilly age first left love and first lost her
there youth found love liked love and love did foster


not as ambitious of theirc own decay
but curious to equal your foredeeds
so tread we now within your wonted way
we find your fruits of judgments and their seeds
we know you loved and loving learn that lore
you scorn kind love because you can no more


though from this pure refiner of the thought
the gleanings of your learnings have you gathered
your lives had been abortive base and naught
except by happy love they had been fathered
then still the swain for i will still avow it
they have no wit nor worth that disallow it


then to renew the ruins of my tears
be thou no hinderer demades i pray thee
if my lovesighs grow tedious in thine ears
fly me that fly from joy i list not stay thee
mourn sheep mourn lambs and damon will weep by you
and when i sigh come home sweet phillis cry you


come home sweet phillis for thine absence causeth
a flowerless primetide in these drooping meadows
to push his beauties forth each primrose pauseth
our lilies and our roses like coy widows
shut in their buds their beauties and bemoan them
because my phillis doth not smile upon them


the trees by my redoubled sighs long blasted
call for thy balmsweet breath and sunny eyes
to whom all natures comforts are handfasted
breathe look on them and they to life arise
they have new liveries with each smile thou lendest
and droop with me when thy fair brow thou bendest


i woo thee phillis with more earnest weeping
than niobe for her dead issue spent
i pray thee nymph who hast our spring in keeping
thou mistress of our flowers and my content
come home and glad our meads of winter weary
and make thy woeful damon blithe and merry


else will i captive all my hopes again
and shut them up in prisons of despair
and weep such tears as shall destroy this plain
and sigh such sighs as shall eclipse the air
and cry such cries as love that hears my crying
shall faint and weep for grief and fall adying


my little world hath vowed no sun shall glad it
except thy little world her light discover
of which heavens would grow proud if so they had it
oh how i fear lest absent jove should love her
i fear it phillis for he never saw one
that had more heavensweet looks to lure and awe one


i swear to thee allseeing sovereign
rolling heavens circles round about our center
except my phillis safe return again
no joy to heart no meat to mouth shall enter
all hope but future hope to be renowned
for weeping phillis shall in tears be drowned


how large a scope lends damon to his moan
wafting those treasures of his happy wit
in registering his woeful woebegone
ah bend thy muse to matters far more fit
for time shall come when phillis is interred
that damon shall confess that he hath erred


when natures riches shall by time dissolved
call thee to see with more judicial eye
how phillis beauties are to dust resolved
thou then shalt ask thyself the reason why
thou wert so fond since phillis was so frail
to praise her gifts that should so quickly fail


have mercy on thyself cease being idle
let reason claim and gain of will his homage
rein in these brainsick thoughts with judgments bridle
a short prevention helps a mighty domage
if phillis love love her yet love her so
that if she fly thou mayst loves fire forego


play with the fire yet die not in the flame
show passions in thy words but not in heart
lest when thou think to bring thy thoughts in frame
thou prove thyself a prisoner by thine art
play with these babes of love as apes with glasses
and put no trust in feathers wind or lasses


did not thine age yield warrantise old man
impatience would enforce me to offend thee
me list not now thy forward skill to scan
yet will i pray that love may mend or end thee
spring flowers seatides earth grass sky stars shall banish
before the thoughts of love or phillis vanish


so get thee gone and fold thy tender sheep
for lo the great automaton of day
in isis stream his golden locks doth steep
sad even her dusky mantle doth display
lightflying fowls the posts of night disport them
and cheerfullooking vesper doth consort them


come you my careful flock forego you master
ill fold you up and after fall asighing
words have no worth my secret wounds to plaster
naught may refresh my joys but phillis nighing
farewell old demades


ah cruel winds why call you hence away
why make you breach betwixt my soul and me
ye traitorous floods why nil your floats delay
until my latest moans discoursed be
for though ye salt seagods withhold the rain
of all your floats and gentle winds be still
while i have wept such tears as might restrain
the rage of tides and winds against their will
ah shall i love your sight bright shining eyes
and must my soul his life and glory leave
must i forsake the bower where solace lives
to trust to tickle fates that still deceive
alas so wills the wanton queen of change
that each man tract this labyrinth of life
with slippery steps now wronged by fortune strange
now drawn by counsel from the maze of strife


ah joy no joy because so soon thou fleetest
hours days and times inconstant in your being
oh life no life since with such chance thou meetest
oh eyes no eyes since you must lose your seeing
soul be thou sad dissolve thy living powers
to crystal tears and by their pores express
the grief that my distressed soul devours
clothe thou my body all in heaviness
my suns appeared fair smiling full of pleasure
but now the vale of absence overclouds them
they fed my heart with joys exceeding measure
which now shall die since absence needs must shroud them
yea die oh death sweet death vouchsafe that blessing
that i may die the death whilst she regardeth
for sweet were death and sweet were deaths oppressing
if she look on who all my life awardeth
oh thou that art the portion of my joy
yet not the portion for thou art the prime
suppose my griefs conceive the deep annoy
that wounds my soul upon this sorry time


pale is my face and in my pale confesses
the pain i suffer since i needs must leave thee
red are mine eyes through tears that them oppresses
dulled are my sprits since fates do now bereave thee
and now ah now my plaints are quite prevented
the winds are fair the sails are hoised high
the anchors weighed and now quite discontented
grief so subdues my heart as it should die
a faint farewell with trembling hand i tender
and with my tears my papers are distained
which closed up my heart in them i render
to tell thee how at parting i complained
vouchsafe his message that doth bring farewell
and for my sake let him with beauty dwell


muses help me sorrow swarmeth
eyes are fraught with seas of languish
heavy hope my solace harmeth
minds repast is bitter anguish


eye of day regarded never
certain trust in world untrusty
flattering hope beguileth ever
weary old and wanton lusty


dawn of day beholds enthroned
fortunes darling proud and dreadless
darksome night doth hear him moaned
who before was rich and needless


rob the sphere of lines united
make a sudden void in nature
force the day to be benighted
reave the cause of time and creature


ere the world will cease to vary
this i weep for this i sorrow
muses if you please to tarry
further helps i mean to borrow


courted once by fortunes favour
compassed now with envys curses
all my thoughts of sorrow savour
hopes run fleeting like the sources


ay me wanton scorn hath maimed
all the joy my heart enjoyed
thoughts their thinking have disclaimed
hate my hopes hath quite annoyed


scant regard my weal hath scanted
looking coy hath forced my lowering
nothing liked where nothing wanted
weds mine eyes to ceaseless showering


former love was once admired
present favour is estranged
loath the pleasure long desired
thus both men and thoughts are changed


lovely swain with lucky guiding
once but now no more so friended
thou my flocks hast had in minding
from the morn till day was ended


drink and fodder food and folding
had my lambs and ewes together
i with them was still beholding
both in warmth and winter weather


now they languish since refused
ewes and lambs are pained with pining
i with ewes and lambs confused
all unto our deaths declining


silence leave thy cave obscured
deign a doleful swain to tender
though disdains i have endured
yet i am no deep offender


phillis son can with his finger
hide his scar it is so little
little sin a day to linger
wise men wander in a tittle


thriftless yet my swain have turned
though my sun he never showeth
though i weep i am not mourned
though i want no pity groweth


yet for pity love my muses
gentle silence be their cover
they must leave their wonted uses
since i leave to be a lover


they shall live with thee inclosed
i will loathe my pen and paper
art shall never be supposed
sloth shall quench the watching taper


kiss them silence kiss them kindly
though i leave them yet i love them
though my wit have led them blindly
yet my swain did once approve them


i will travel soils removed
night and morrow never merry
thou shalt harbour that i loved
i will love that makes me weary


if perchance the sheep estrayeth
in thy walks and shades unhaunted
tell the teen my heart betrayeth
how neglect my joys hath daunted


ye heralds of my heart mine ardent groans
o tears which gladly would burst out to brooks
oh spent on fruitless sand my surging moans
oh thoughts enthralled unto careboding looks
ah just laments of my unjust distress
ah fond desires whom reason could not guide
oh hopes of love that intimate redress
yet prove the loadstars unto bad betide
when will you cease or shall pain neverceasing
seize oh my heart oh mollify your rage
lest your assaults with overswift increasing
procure my death or call on timeless age
what if they do they shall but feed the fire
which i have kindled by my fond desire


fair art thou phillis ay so fair sweet maid
as nor the sun nor i have seen more fair
for in thy cheeks sweet roses are embayed
and gold more pure than gold doth gild thy hair
sweet bees have hived their honey on thy tongue
and hebe spiced her nectar with thy breath
about thy neck do all the graces throng
and lay such baits as might entangle death
in such a breast what heart would not be thrall
from such sweet arms who would not wish embraces
at thy fair hands who wonders not at all
wonder itself through ignorance embases
yet natheless though wondrous gifts you call these
my faith is far more wonderful than all these


burst burst poor heart thou hast no longer hope
captive mine eyes unto eternal sleep
let all my senses have no further scope
let death be lord of me and all my sheep
for phillis hath betrothed fierce disdain
that makes his mortal mansion in her heart
and though my tongue have long time taken pain
to sue divorce and wed her to desert
she will not yield my words can have no power
she scorns my faith she laughs at my sad lays
she fills my soul with never ceasing sour
who filled the world with volumes of her praise
in such extremes what wretch can cease to crave
his peace from death who can no mercy have


no glory makes me glorious or glad
nor pleasure may to pleasure me dispose
no comfort can revive my senses sad
nor hope enfranchise me with one repose
nor in her absence taste i one delight
nor in her presence am i well content
was never time gave term to my despite
nor joy that dried the tears of my lament
nor hold i hope of weal in memory
nor have i thought to change my restless grief
nor doth my conquest yield me sovereignty
nor hope repose nor confidence relief
for why she sorts her frowns and favours so
as when i gain or lose i cannot know


i wage the combat with two mighty foes
which are more strong than i ten thousand fold
the one is when thy pleasure i do lose
the other when thy person i behold
in seeing thee a swarm of loves confound me
and cause my death in spite of my resist
and if i see thee not thy want doth wound me
for in thy sight my comfort doth consist
the one in me continual care createth
the other doth occasion my desire
the one the edge of all my joy rebateth
the other makes me a phoenix in loves fire
so that i grieve when i enjoy your presence
and die for grief by reason of your absence


ill teach thee lovely phillis what love is
it is a vision seeming such as thou
that flies as fast as it assaults mine eyes
it is affection that doth reason miss
it is a shape of pleasure like to you
which meets the eye and seen on sudden dies
it is a doubled grief a spark of pleasure
begot by vain desire and this is love
whom in our youth we count our chiefest treasure
in age for want of power we do reprove
yea such a power is love whose loss is pain
and having got him we repent our gain


fair eyes whilst fearful i your fair admire
by unexpressed sweetness that i gain
my memory of sorrow doth expire
and falconlike i tower joys heavens amain
but when your suns in oceans of their glory
shut up their daybright shine i die for thought
so pass my joys as doth a newplayed story
and one poor sigh breathes all delight to naught
so to myself i live not but for you
for you i live and you i love but none else
oh then fair eyes whose light i live to view
or poor forlorn despised to live alone else
look sweet since from the pith of contemplation
love gathereth life and living breedeth passion


not causeless were you christened gentle flowers
the one of faith the other fancys pride
for she who guides both faith and fancys power
in your fair colors wraps her ivory side
as one of you hath whiteness without stain
so spotless is my love and never tainted
and as the other shadoweth faith again
such is my lass with no fond change acquainted
and as nor tyrant sun nor winter weather
may ever change sweet amaranthus hue
so she though love and fortune join together
will never leave to be both fair and true
and should i leave thee then thou pretty elf
nay first let damon quite forget himself


i feel myself endangered beyond reason
my death already twixt the cup and lip
because my proud desire through cursed treason
would make my hopes mount heaven which cannot skip
my fancy still requireth at my hands
such things as are not cannot may not be
and my desire although my power withstands
will give me wings who never yet could flee
what then remains except my maimed soul
extort compassion from loveflying age
or if naught else their fury may control
to call on death that quells affections rage
which death shall dwell with me and never fly
since vain desire seeks that hope doth deny


i do compare unto thy youthly clear
which always bides within thy flowring prime
the month of april that bedews our clime
with pleasant flowers when as his showers appear
before thy face shall fly false cruelty
before his face the doly season fleets
mild been his looks thine eyes are full of sweets
firm is his course firm is thy loyalty
he paints the fields through liquid crystal showers
thou paintst my verse with pallas learned flowers
with zephirus sweet breath he fills the plains
and thou my heart with weeping sighs dost wring
his brows are dewed with mornings crystal spring
thou makst my eyes with tears bemoan my pains


devoid of reason thrall to foolish ire
i walk and chase a savage fairy still
now near the flood straight on the mounting hill
now midst the woods of youth and vain desire
for leash i bear a cord of careful grief
for brach i lead an overforward mind
my hounds are thoughts and rage despairing blind
pain cruelty and care without relief
but they perceiving that my swift pursuit
my flying fairy cannot overtake
with open mouths their prey on me do make
like hungry hounds that lately lost their suit
and full of fury on their master feed
to hasten on my hapless death with speed


a thousand times to think and think the same
to two fair eyes to show a naked heart
great thirst with bitter liquor to restrain
to take repast of care and crooked smart
to sigh full oft without relent of ire
to die for grief and yet conceal the tale
to others will to fashion my desire
to pine in looks disguised through pensivepale
a short dispite a faith unfeigned true
to love my foe and set my life at naught
with heedless eyes mine endless harms to view
a will to speak a fear to tell the thought
to hope for all yet for despair to die
is of my life the certain destiny


when first sweet phillis whom i must adore
gan with her beauties bless our wondring sky
the son of rhea from their fatal store
made all the gods to grace her majesty
apollo first his golden rays among
did form the beauty of her bounteous eyes
he graced her with his sweet melodious song
and made her subject of his poesies
the warrior mars bequeathed her fierce disdain
venus her smile and phoebe all her fair
python his voice and ceres all her grain
the morn her locks and fingers did repair
young love his bow and thetis gave her feet
clio her praise pallas her science sweet


i would in rich and goldencoloured rain
with tempting showers in pleasant sort descend
into fair phillis lap my lovely friend
when sleep her sense with slumber doth restrain
i would be changed to a milkwhite bull
when midst the gladsome fields she should appear
by pleasant fineness to surprise my dear
whilst from their stalks she pleasant flowers did pull
i were content to weary out my pain
to be narsissus so she were a spring
to drown in her those woes my heart do wring
and more i wish transformed to remain
that whilst i thus in pleasures lap did lie
i might refresh desire which else would die


i hope and fear i pray and hold my peace
now freeze my thoughts and straight they fry again
i now admire and straight my wonders cease
i loose my bonds and yet myself restrain
this likes me most that leaves me discontent
my courage serves and yet my heart doth fail
my will doth climb whereas my hopes are spent
i laugh at love yet when he comes i quail
the more i strive the duller bide i still
i would be thralled and yet i freedom love
i would redress yet hourly feed mine ill
i would repine and dare not once reprove
and for my love i am bereft of power
and strengthless strive my weakness to devour


if so i seek the shades i presently do see
the god of love forsakes his bow and sit me by
if that i think to write his muses pliant be
if so i plain my grief the wanton boy will cry
if i lament his pride he doth increase my pain
if tears my cheeks attaint his cheeks are moist with moan
if i disclose the wounds the which my heart hath slain
he takes his fascia off and wipes them dry anon
if so i walk the woods the woods are his delight
if i myself torment he bathes him in my blood
he will my soldier be if once i wend to fight
if seas delight he steers my bark amidst the hood
in brief the cruel god doth never from me go
but makes my lasting love eternal with my woe


these fierce incessant waves that stream along my face
which show the certain proof of my neerceasing pains
fair phillis are no tears that trickle from my brains
for why such streams of ruth within me find no place
these floods that wet my cheeks are gathered from thy grace
and thy perfections and from hundred thousand flowers
which from thy beauties spring whereto i medley showers
of rose and lilies too the colours of thy face


my love doth serve for fire my heart the furnace is
the aperries of my sighs augment the burning flame
the limbec is mine eye that doth distil the same
and by how much my fire is violent and sly
by so much doth it cause the waters mount on high
that shower from out mine eyes for to assuage my miss


who lives enthralled to cupid and his flame
from day to day is changed in sundry sort
the proof whereof myself may well report
who oft transformed by him may teach the same
i first was turned into a wounded hart
that bare the bloody arrow in my side
then to a swan that midst the waters glide
with piteous voice presaged my deadly smart
eftsoons i waxed a faint and fading flower
then was i made a fountain sudden dry
distilling all my tears from troubled eye
now am i salamander by his power
living in flames but hope ere long to be
a voice to talk my mistress majesty


my matchless mistress whose delicious eyes
have power to perfect natures privy wants
even when the sun in greatest pomp did rise
with pretty tread did press the tender plants
each stalk whilst forth she stalks to kiss her feet
is proud with pomp and prodigal of sweet
her fingers fair in favouring every flower
that wooed their ivory for a wished touch
by chancesweet chanceupon a blessed hour
did pluck the flower where love himself did couch
where love did couch by summer toil suppressed
and sought his sleeps within so sweet a nest


the virgins hand that held the wanton thrall
imprisoned him within the roseate leaves
and twixt her teats with favour did install
the lovely rose where love his rest receives
the lad that felt the soft and sweet so nigh
drowned in delights disdains his liberty
and said let venus seek another son
for here my only matchless mother is
from whose fair orient orbs the drink doth run
that deifies my state with greater bliss
this said he sucked my mistress blushing smiled
since love was both her prisoner and her child


now i find thy looks were feigned
quickly lost and quickly gained
soft thy skin like wool of wethers
heart unstable light as feathers
tongue untrusty subtilesighted
wanton will with change delighted
siren pleasant foe to reason
cupid plague thee for this treason


of thine eyes i made my mirror
from thy beauty came mine error
all thy words i counted witty
all thy smiles i deemed pity
thy false tears that me aggrieved
first of all my trust deceived
siren pleasant foe to reason
cupid plague thee for this treason


feigned acceptance when i asked
lovely words with cunning masked
holy vows but heart unholy
wretched man my trust was folly
lily white and pretty winking
solemn vows but sorry thinking
siren pleasant foe to reason
cupid plague thee for this treason


now i see o seemly cruel
others warm them at my fuel
wit shall guide me in this durance
since in love is no assurance
change thy pasture take thy pleasure
beauty is a fading treasure
siren pleasant foe to reason
cupid plague thee for this treason


prime youth lusts not age still follow
and make white these tresses yellow
wrinkled face for looks delightful
shall acquaint the dame despightful
and when time shall eat thy glory
then too late thou wilt be sorry
siren pleasant foe to reason
cupid plague thee for thy treason


resembling none and none so poor as i
poor to the world and poor in each esteem
whose firstborn loves at first obscured did die
and bred no fame but flame of base misdeem
under the ensign of whose tired pen
loves legions forth have masked by others masked
think how i live wronged by illtongued men
not master of myself to all wrongs tasked
oh thou that canst and she that may do all things
support these languishing conceits that perish
look on their growth perhaps these silly small things
may win this wordly palm so you do cherish
homer hath vowed and i with him do vow this
he will and shall revive if you allow this


to the richest treasury
that eer filld ambitious eye
to the faire bright magazin
hath impoverisht loves queen
to th exchequer of all honour
all take pensions but from her
to the taper of the thore
which the god himselfe but bore
to the sea of chaste delight
let me cast the drop i write
and as at lorettos shrine
caesar shovels in his mine
th empres spreads her carkanets
the lords submit their coronets


knights their chased armes hang by
maids diamondruby fancies tye
whilst from the pilgrim she wears
one poore false pearl but ten true tears
so among the orient prize
saphyronyx eulogies
offerd up unto your fame
take my garnetdublet name
and vouchsafe midst those rich joyes
with devotion these toyes


now y have obliegd the age thy wel known worth
is to our joy auspiciously brought forth
good morrow to thy son thy first borne flame
which as thou gavst it birth stamps it a name
that fate and a discerning age shall set
the chiefest jewell in her coronet


why then needs all this paines those seasond pens
that standing lifeguard to a booke kinde friends
that with officious care thus guard thy gate
as if thy child were illigitimate
forgive their freedome since unto their praise
they write to give not to dispute thy bayes


as when some glorious queen whose pregnant wombe
brings forth a kingdome with her firstborne sonne
marke but the subjects joyfull hearts and eyes
some offer gold and others sacrifice
this slayes a lambe that not so rich as hee
brings but a dove this but a bended knee
and though their giftes be various yet their sence
speaks only this one thought long live the prince


so my best brother if unto your name
i offer up a thin blewburning flame
pardon my love since none can make thee shine
vnlesse they kindle first their torch at thine
then as inspird they boldly write nay that
which their amazed lights but twinkld at
and their illustrate thoughts doe voice this right
lucasta held their torch thou gavst it light


how humble is thy muse deare that can daign
such servants as my pen to entertaine
when all the sonnes of wit glory to be
clad in thy muses gallant livery
i shall disgrace my master prove a staine
and no addition to his honourd traine
though all that read me will presume to swear
i neer read thee yet if it may appear
i love the writer and admire the writ
i my owne want betray not wrong thy wit
did thy worke want a prayse my barren brain
could not afford it my attempt were vaine
it needs no foyle all that ere writ before
are foyles to thy faire poems and no more
then to be lodgd in the same sheets with thine
may prove disgrace to yours but grace to mine


deare lovelace i am now about to prove
i cannot write a verse but can write love
on such a subject as thy booke i cood
write books much greater but not half so good
but as the humble tenant that does bring
a chicke or egges fors offering
is tane into the buttry and does fox
equall with him that gave a stalled oxe
so since the heart of evry cheerfull giver
makes pounds no more accepted than a stiver
though som thy prayse in rich stiles sing i may
in stiverstile write love as well as they
i write so well that i no criticks feare
for whole read mine when as thy bookes so neer
vnlesse thy selfe then you shall secure mine
from those and ile engage my selfe for thine
theyl dot themselves thee this allay youl take
i love thy book and yet not for thy sake


so from the pregnant braine of jove did rise
pallas the queene of wit and beautious eyes
as faire lucasta from thy temples flowes
temples no lesse ingenious then joves
alike in birth so shall she be in fame
and be immortall to preserve thy name


now when the wars augment our woes and fears
and the shrill noise of drums oppresse our ears
now peace and safety from our shores are fled
to holes and cavernes to secure their head
now all the graces from the land are sent
and the nine muses suffer banishment
whence spring these raptures whence this heavenly rime
so calme and even in so harsh a time
well might that charmer his faire caelia crowne
and that more polisht tyterus renowne
his sacarissa when in groves and bowres
they could repose their limbs on beds of flowrs


when wit had prayse and merit had reward
and every noble spirit did accord
to love the muses and their priests to raise
and interpale their browes with flourishing bayes
but in a time distracted so to sing
when peace is hurried hence on rages wing
when the fresh bayes are from the temple torne
and every art and science made a scorne
then to raise up by musicke of thy art
our drooping spirits and our grieved hearts
then to delight our souls and to inspire
our breast with pleasure from thy charming lyre
then to divert our sorrowes by thy straines
making us quite forget our seven yeers paines


in the past wars unlesse that orpheus be
a sharer in thy glory for when he


he stroke his lute with like admired art
and made the damned to forget their smart


he that doth paint the beauties of your verse
must use your pensil be polite soft terse
forgive that man whose best of art is love
if he no equall master to you prove
my heart is all my eloquence and that
speaks sharp affection when my words fall flat
i reade you like my mistresse and discry
in every line the quicknesse of her eye
her smoothnesse in each syllable her grace
to marshall evry word in the right place
it is the excellence and soule of wit
when evry thing is free as well as fit


for metaphors packt up and crowded close
swath ye minds sweetnes and display the throws
and like those chickens hatcht in furnaces
produce or one limbe more or one limbe lesse
then nature bids survey such when they write
no clause buts justld with an epithite
so powerfully you draw when you perswade
passions in you in us are vertues made
such is the magick of that lawfull shell
that where it doth but talke it doth compell
for no apelles till this time ere drew
a venus to the waste so well as you


the world shall now no longer mourne nor vex
for th obliquity of a crossgraind sex
nor beauty swell above her bankes and made
for ornament the universe invade
so fiercely that tis questiond in our bookes
whether kils most the amazons sword or lookes
lucasta in loves game discreetly makes
women and men joyntly to share the stakes
and lets us know when women scorne it is
mens hot love makes the antiparisthesis
and a lay lover here such comfort finds
as holy writ gives to affected minds


the wilder nymphs lovs power could not comand
are by thy almighty numbers brought to hand
and flying daphnes caught amazed vow
they never heard apollo court till now
tis not by force of armes this feat is done
for that would puzzle even the knight o th sun
but tis by powr of art and such a way
as orpheus usd when he made fiends obay


ovr times are much degenerate from those
which your sweet muse which your fair fortune chose
and as complexions alter with the climes
our wits have drawne th infection of our times
that candid age no other way could tell
to be ingenious but by speaking well
who best could prayse had then the greatest prayse
twas more esteemd to give then wear the bayes
modest ambition studid only then
to honour not her selfe but worthy men
these vertues now are banisht out of towne
our civill wars have lost the civicke crowne
he highest builds who with most art destroys
and against others fame his owne employs
i see the envious caterpillar sit
on the faire blossome of each growing wit
the ayres already tainted with the swarms
of insects which against you rise in arms
wordpeckers paperrats bookscorpions
of wit corrupted the unfashiond sons
the barbed censurers begin to looke
like the grim consistory on thy booke
and on each line cast a reforming eye
severer then the yong presbytery
till when in vaine they have thee all perusd
you shall for being faultlesse be accusd
some reading your lucasta will alledge
you wrongd in her the houses priviledge


some that you under sequestration are
because you write when going to the warre
and one the book prohibits because kent
their first petition by the authour sent
but when the beauteous ladies came to know
that their deare lovelace was endangerd so
lovelace that thawd the most congealed brest
he who lovd best and them defended best
whose hand so rudely grasps the steely brand
whose hand so gently melts the ladies hand
they all in mutiny though yet undrest
sallyd and would in his defence contest
and one the loveliest that was yet ere seen
thinking that i too of the rout had been
mine eyes invaded with a female spight
she knew what pain t would be to lose that sight
o no mistake not i replyd for i
in your defence or in his cause would dy
but he secure of glory and of time
above their envy or mine aid doth clime
him valianst men and fairest nymphs approve
his booke in them finds judgement with you love


if the desire of glory speak a mind
more nobly operative and more refind
what vast soule moves thee or what heros spirit
kept ints traduction pure dost thou inherit
that not contented with one single fame
dost to a double glory spread thy name
and on thy happy temples safely set
both th delphick wreath and civic coronet
wast not enough for us to know how far
thou couldst in season suffer act and dare
but we must also witnesse with what height
and what ionick sweetnesse thou canst write


and melt those eager passions that are
stubborn enough t enrage the god of war
into a noble love which may expire
in an illustrious pyramid of fire
which having gained his due station may
fix there and everlasting flames display
this is the braver path time soone can smother
the dearbought spoils and tropheis of the other
how many fiery heroes have there been
whose triumphs were as soone forgot as seen
because they wanted some diviner one
to rescue thee from night and make thee known
such art thou to thy selfe while others dream
strong flattries on a faind or borrowd theam
thou shalt remaine in thine owne lustre bright
and adde unto t lucastas chaster light
for none so fit to sing great things as he
that can act ore all lights of poetry
thus had achilles his owne gests designd
he had his genius homer far outshind


poets and painters have some near relation
compard with fancy and imagination
the one paints shadowed persons in pure kind
the other paints the pictures of the mind
in purer verse and as rare zeuxes fame
shind till apelles art eclipsd the same
by a more exquisite and curious line
in zeuxeses with pensill far more fine
so have our modern poets late done well
till thine appeard which scarce have paralel
they like to zeuxes grapes beguile the sense
but thine do ravish the intelligence
like the rare banquet of apelles drawn
and covered over with most curious lawn


thus if thy careles draughts are cald the best
what would thy lines have beene hadst thou profest
that faculty infusd of poetry
which adds such honour unto thy chivalry
doubtles thy verse had all as far transcended
as sydneyes prose who poets once defended
for when i read thy much renowned pen
my fancy there finds out another ben
in thy brave language judgement wit and art
of every piece of thine in every part
where thy seraphique sydneyan fire is raised high
in valour vertue love and loyalty
virgil was styld the loftiest of all
ovid the smoothest and most naturall


martiall concise and witty quaint and pure
iuvenall grave and learned though obscure
but all these rare ones which i heere reherse
do live againe in thee and in thy verse
although not in the language of their time
yet in a speech as copious and sublime
the rare apelles in thy picture wee
perceive and in thy soule apollo see
wel may each grace and muse then crown thy praise
with mars his banner and minervas bayes


chast as creation meant us and more bright
then the first day in s uneclipsed light
is thy lucasta and thou offerest heere
lines to her name as undefild and cleere
such as the first indeed more happy dayes
when vertue wit and learning wore the bayes
now vice assumes would to her memory give
a vestall flame that should for ever live
plact in a christal temple reard to be
the embleme of her thoughts integrity
and on the porch thy name insculpt my friend
whose love like to the flame can know no end


the marble step that to the alter brings
the hallowed priests with their clean offerings
shall hold their names that humbly crave to be
votaries to th shrine and grateful friends to thee
so shal we live although our offrings prove
meane to the world for ever by thy love


ile doe my nothing too and try
to dabble to thy memory
not that i offer to thy name
encomiums of thy lasting fame
those by the landed have been writ
mines but a yongerbrother wit
a wit thats hudled up in scarres
borne like my rough selfe in the warres
and as a squire in the fight
serves only to attend the knight
so tis my glory in this field
where others act to beare thy shield


enough enough of orbs and spheres
reach me a trumpet or a drum
to sound sharp synnets in your ears
and beat a deep encomium


i know not th eight intelligence
those that do understand it pray
let them step hither and from thence
speak what they all do sing or say


nor what your diapasons are
your sympathies and symphonies
to me they seem as distant farre
as whence they take their infant rise


but ive a grateful heart can ring
a peale of ordnance to your praise
and volleys of small plaudits bring
to clowd a crown about your baies


though laurel is thought thunder free
that storms and lightning disallows
yet caesar thorough fire and sea
snatches her to twist his conquering brows


and now me thinks like him you stand
i th head of all the poets hoast
whilest with your words you do command
they silent do their duty boast


which done the army ecchoes ore
like gamble ios one and all
and in their various notes implore
long live our noble generall


if to be absent were to be
away from thee
or that when i am gone
you or i were alone
then my lucasta might i crave
pity from blustring winde or swallowing wave


but ile not sigh one blast or gale
to swell my saile
or pay a teare to swage
the foaming blewgods rage
for whether he will let me passe
or no im still as happy as i was


though seas and land betwixt us both
our faith and troth
like separated soules
all time and space controules
above the highest sphere wee meet
unseene unknowne and greet as angels greet


so then we doe anticipate
our afterfate
and are alive ith skies
if thus our lips and eyes
can speake like spirits unconfind
in heavn their earthy bodies left behind


tell me not sweet i am unkinde
that from the nunnerie
of thy chaste breast and quiet minde
to warre and armes i flie


true a new mistresse now i chase
the first foe in the field
and with a stronger faith imbrace
a sword a horse a shield


yet this inconstancy is such
as you too shall adore
i could not love thee dear so much
lovd i not honour more


tis true the beauteous starre
to which i first did bow
burnt quicker brighter far
than that which leads me now
which shines with more delight
for gazing on that light
so long neere lost my sight


through foul we follow faire
for had the world one face
and earth been bright as ayre
we had knowne neither place
indians smell not their neast
a swisse or finne tastes best
the spices of the east


so from the glorious sunne
who to his height hath got
with what delight we runne
to some black cave or grot
and heavnly sydney you
twice read had rather view
some odde romance so new


the god that constant keepes
unto his deities
is poore in joyes and sleepes
imprisond in the skies
this knew the wisest who
from juno stole below
to love a bear or cow




amarantha sweet and faire
ah brade no more that shining haire
as my curious hand or eye
hovering round thee let it flye


let it flye as unconfind
as its calme ravisher the winde
who hath left his darling th east
to wanton ore that spicie neast


evry tresse must be confest
but neatly tangled at the best
like a clue of golden thread
most excellently ravelled


doe not then winde up that light
in ribands and oercloud in night
like the sun ins early ray
but shake your head and scatter day


see tis broke within this grove
the bower and the walkes of love
weary lye we downe and rest
and fanne each others panting breast


heere weell strippe and coole our fire
in creame below in milkbaths higher
and when all wells are drawne dry
ill drink a teare out of thine eye


which our very joys shall leave
that sorrowes thus we can deceive
or our very sorrowes weepe
that joyes so ripe so little keepe


depose your finger of that ring
and crowne mine witht awhile
now i restort pray dos it bring
back with it more of soile
or shines it not as innocent
as honest as before twas lent


so then inrich me with that treasure
twill but increase your store
and please me faire one with that pleasure
must please you still the more
not to save others is a curse
the blackest when yare nere the worse


sweet serene skyelike flower
haste to adorn her bower
from thy long clowdy bed
shoot forth thy damaske head


newstartled blush of flora
the griefe of pale aurora
who will contest no more
haste haste to strowe her floore


vermilion ball thats given
from lip to lip in heaven
loves couches coverled
haste haste to make her bed


dear offspring of pleasd venus
and jollie plumpe silenus
haste haste to decke the haire
of th only sweetly faire


see rosie is her bower
her floore is all this flower
her bed a rosie nest
by a bed of roses prest


but early as she dresses
why fly you her bright tresses
ah i have found i feare
because her cheekes are neere


the childish god of love did sweare
thus by my awfull bow and quiver
yon weeping kissing smiling pair
ile scatter all their vowes i th ayr
and their knit imbraces shiver


up then to th head with his best art
full of spite and envy blowne
at her constant marble heart
he drawes his swiftest surest dart
which bounded back and hit his owne


now the prince of fires burnes
flames in the luster of her eyes
triumphant she refuses scornes
he submits adores and mournes
and is his votresse sacrifice


foolish boy resolve me now
what tis to sigh and not be heard
he weeping kneeld and made a vow
the world shall love as yon fast two
so on his singd wings up he steerd


ah me the little tyrant theefe
as once my heart was playing
he snatcht it up and flew away
laughing at all my praying


proud of his purchase he surveys
and curiously sounds it
and though he sees it full of wounds
cruel one still he wounds it


and now this heart is all his sport
which as a ball he boundeth
from hand to breast from breast to lip
and all its rest confoundeth


then as a top he sets it up
and pitifully whips it
sometimes he cloathes it gay and fine
then straight againe he strips it


he coverd it with false reliefe
which gloriously showd it
and for a morningcushionet
ons mother he bestowd it


each day with her small brazen stings
a thousand times she racd it
but then at night bright with her gemmes
once neere her breast she placd it


there warme it gan to throb and bleed
she knew that smart and grieved
at length this poore condemned heart
with these rich drugges repreeved


she washt the wound with a fresh teare
which my lucasta dropped
and in the sleavesilke of her haire
twas hard bound up and wrapped


she proabd it with her constancie
and found no rancor nigh it
only the anger of her eye
had wrought some proud flesh by it


then prest she narde in evry veine
which from her kisses trilled
and with the balme heald all its paine
that from her hand distilled


but yet this heart avoyds me still
will not by me be owned
buts fled to its physitians breast
there proudly sits inthroned


heark oh heark you guilty trees
in whose gloomy galleries
was the cruellst murder done
that ere yet eclipst the sunne
be then henceforth in your twigges
blasted ere you sprout to sprigges
feele no season of the yeere
but what shaves off all your haire
nor carve any from your wombes
ought but coffins and their tombes


when i by thy faire shape did sweare
and mingled with each vowe a teare
i lovd i lovd thee best
i swore as i profest
for all the while you lasted warme and pure
my oathes too did endure
but once turnd faithlesse to thy selfe and old
they then with thee incessantly grew cold


i swore my selfe thy sacrifice
by th ebon bowes that guard thine eyes
which now are alterd white
and by the glorious light
of both those stars which of their spheres bereft
only the gellies left
then changed thus no more im bound to you
then swearing to a saint that proves untrue


lucasta wept and still the bright
inamourd god of day
with his soft handkercher of light
kist the wet pearles away


but when her teares his heate orecame
in cloudes he quensht his beames
and grievd wept out his eye of flame
so drowned her sad streames


at this she smiled when straight the sun
cleerd by her kinde desires
and by her eyes reflexion
fast kindld there his fires


long in thy shackels liberty
i ask not from these walls but thee
left for awhile anothers bride
to fancy all the world beside


yet ere i doe begin to love
see how i all my objects prove
then my free soule to that confine
twere possible i might call mine


first i would be in love with peace
and her rich swelling breasts increase
but how alas how may that be
despising earth she will love me


faine would i be in love with war
as my deare just avenging star
but war is lovd so evrywhere
evn he disdaines a lodging here


thee and thy wounds i would bemoane
faire thoroughshot religion
but he lives only that kills thee
and who so bindes thy hands is free


i would love a parliament
as a maine prop from heavn sent
but ah whos he that would be wedded
to th fairest body thats beheaded


next would i court my liberty
and then my birthright property
but can that be when it is knowne
theres nothing you can call your owne


a reformation i would have
as for our griefes a sovraigne salve
that is a cleansing of each wheele
of state that yet some rust doth feele


but not a reformation so
as to reforme were to orethrow
like watches by unskilfull men
disjoynted and set ill againe


the publick faith i would adore
but she is bankerupt of her store
nor how to trust her can i see
for she that couzens all must me


since then none of these can be
fit objects for my love and me
what then remaines but th only spring
of all our loves and joyes the king


he who being the whole ball
of day on earth lends it to all
when seeking to ecclipse his right
blinded we stand in our owne light


and now an universall mist
of error is spread ore each breast
with such a fury edgd as is
not found in th inwards of th abysse


oh from thy glorious starry waine
dispense on me one sacred beame
to light me where i soone may see
how to serve you and you trust me


eastrich thou featherd foole and easie prey
that larger sailes to thy broad vessell needst
snakes through thy gutturneck hisse all the day
then on thy iron messe at supper feedst


o what a glorious transmigration
from this to so divine an edifice
hast thou straight made heere from a winged stone
transformd into a bird of paradice


now doe thy plumes for hiew and luster vie
with th arch of heavn that triumphs ore past wet
and in a rich enameld pinion lye
with saphyres amethists and opalls set


sometime they wing her side thee strive to drown
the days eyes piercing beames whose amrous heat
sollicites still till with this shield of downe
from her brave face his glowing fires are beat


but whilst a plumy curtaine she doth draw
a chrystall mirror sparkles in thy breast
in which her fresh aspect when as she saw
and then her foe retired to the west


deare engine that oth sun gotst me the day
spite of his hot assaults madst him retreat
no wind said she dare with thee henceforth play
but mine own breath to coole the tyrants heat


my lively shade thou ever shalt retaine
in thy inclosed featherframed glasse
and but unto our selves to all remaine
invisible thou feature of this face


so said her sad swaine overheard and cried
yee gods for faith unstaind this a reward
feathers and glasse toutweigh my vertue tryed
ah show their empty strength the gods accord


now falln the brittle favourite lyes and burst
amasd lucasta weepes repents and flies
to her alexis vowes her selfe acurst
if hence she dresse her selfe but in his eyes


yee happy floods that now must passe
the sacred conduicts of her wombe
smooth and transparent as your face
when you are deafe and windes are dumbe


be proud and if your waters be
fould with a counterfeyted teare
or some false sigh hath stained yee
haste and be purified there


and when her rosie gates yhave tracd
continue yet some orient wet
till turnd into a gemme yare placd
like diamonds with rubies set


yee drops that dew th arabian bowers
tell me did you ere smell or view
on any leafe of all your flowers
soe sweet a sent so rich a hiew


but as through th organs of her breath
you trickle wantonly beware
ambitious seas in their just death
as well as lovers must have share


and see you boyle as well as i
you that to coole her did aspire
now troubled and neglected lye
nor can your selves quench your owne fire


yet still be happy in the thought
that in so small a time as this
through all the heavens you were brought
of vertue honour love and blisse


ah lucasta why so bright
spread with early streaked light
if still vailed from our sight
what ist but eternall night


ah lucasta why so chaste
with that vigour ripenes gract
not to be by man imbract
makes that royall coyne imbacet
and this golden orchard waste


ah lucasta why so great
that thy crammed coffers sweat
yet not owner of a seat
may shelter you from natures heat
and your earthly joyes compleat


ah lucasta why so good
blest with an unstained flood
flowing both through soule and blood
if it be not understood
tis a diamond in mud


lucasta stay why dost thou flye
thou art not bright but to the eye
nor chaste but in the mariagetye
nor great but in this treasurie
nor good but in that sanctitie


harder then the orient stone
like an apparition
or as a pale shadow gone
dumbe and deafe she hence is flowne


then receive this equall dombe
virgins strow no teare or bloome
no one dig the parian wombe
raise her marble heart ith roome
and tis both her coarse and tombe


see what an undisturbed teare
she weepes for her last sleepe
but viewing her straight wakd a star
she weepes that she did weepe


griefe nere before did tyranize
on th honour of that brow
and at the wheeles of her brave eyes
was captive led til now


thus for a saints apostacy
the unimagind woes
and sorrowes of the hierarchy
none but an angel knowes


thus for lost soules recovery
the clapping of all wings
and triumphs of this victory
none but an angel sings


so none but she knows to bemone
this equal virgins fate
none but lucasta can her crowne
of glory celebrate


then dart on me chast light one ray
by which i may discry
thy joy cleare through this cloudy day
to dresse my sorrow by


oh stay that covetous hand first turn all eye
all depth and minde then mystically spye
her souls faire picture her faire souls in all
so truely copied from th originall
that you will sweare her body by this law
is but its shadow as this itsnow draw


cold as the breath of winds that blow
to silver shot descending snow
lucasta sight when she did close
the world in frosty chaines
and then a frowne to rubies frose
the blood boyld in our veines
yet cooled not the heat her sphere
of beauties first had kindled there


then movd and with a suddaine flame
impatient to melt all againe
straight from her eyes she lightning hurld
and earth in ashes mournes
the sun his blaze denies the world
and in her luster burnes
yet warmed not the hearts her nice
disdaine had first congeald to ice


and now her teares nor grievd desire
can quench this raging pleasing fire
fate but one way allowes behold
her smiles divinity
they fannd this heat and thawd that cold
so framd up a new sky
thus earth from flames and ice repreevd
ere since hath in her sunshine livd


that frantick errour i adore
and am confirmd the earth turns round
now satisfied ore and ore
as rowling waves so flowes the ground
and as her neighbour reels the shore
finde such a woman says she loves
shes that fixt heavn which never moves


in marble steele or porphyrie
who carves or stampes his armes or face
lookes it by rust or storme must dye
this womans love no time can raze
hardned like ice in the suns eye
or your reflection in a glasse
which keepes possession though you passe


we not behold a watches hand
to stir nor plants or flowers to grow
must we infer that this doth stand
and therefore that those do not blow
this she acts calmer like heavns brand
the stedfast lightning slow loves dart
she kils but ere we feele the smart


oh she is constant as the winde
that revels in an evnings aire
certaine as wayes unto the blinde
more reall then her flattries are
gentle as chaines that honour binde
more faithfull then an hebrew jew
but as the divel not halfe so true


from the dire monument of thy black roome
wher now that vestal flame thou dost intombe
as in the inmost cell of all earths wombe


sacred lucasta like the powrfull ray
of heavenly truth passe this cimmerian way
whilst all the standards of your beames display


arise and climbe our whitest highest hill
there your sad thoughts with joy and wonder fill
and see seas calme as earth earth as your will


behold how lightning like a taper flyes
and guilds your charit but ashamed dyes
seeing it selfe outgloried by your eyes


threatning and boystrous tempests gently bow
and to your steps part in soft paths when now
there no where hangs a cloud but on your brow


no showrs but twixt your lids nor gelid snow
but what your whiter chaster brest doth ow
whilst winds in chains colder for sorrow blow


shrill trumpets doe only sound to eate
artillery hath loaden evry dish with meate
and drums at evry health alarmes beate


all things lucasta but lucasta call
trees borrow tongues waters in accents fall
the aire doth sing and fire is musicall


awake from the dead vault in which you dwell
alls loyall here except your thoughts rebell
which so let loose often their genrall quell


see she obeys by all obeyed thus
no storms heats colds no soules contentious
nor civill war is found i meane to us


lovers and angels though in heavn they show
and see the woes and discords here below
what they not feele must not be said to know


up with the jolly bird of light
who sounds his third retreat to night
faire amarantha from her bed
ashamed starts and rises red
as the carnationmantled morne
who now the blushing robe doth spurne
and puts on angry gray whilst she
the envy of a deity
arayes her limbes too rich indeed
to be inshrind in such a weed
yet lovely twas and strait but fit
not made for her but she to it
by nature it sate close and free
as the just bark unto the tree
unlike loves martyrs of the towne
all day imprisond in a gown
who rackt in silke stead of a dresse
are cloathed in a frame or presse
and with that liberty and room
the dead expatiate in a tombe
no cabinets with curious washes
bladders and perfumed plashes


no venometemperd waters here
mercury is banished this sphere
her payles all this in which wet glasse
she both doth cleanse and view her face
far hence all iberian smells
hot amulets pomander spells
fragrant gales cool ayr the fresh
and naturall odour of her flesh
proclaim her sweet from th wombe as morne
those colourd things were made not borne
which fixt within their narrow straits
do looke like their own counterfeyts
so like the provance rose she walkt
flowerd with blush with verdure stalkt
th officious wind her loose hayre curles
the dewe her happy linnen purles
but wets a tresse which instantly
sol with a crisping beame doth dry


into the garden is she come
love and delights elisium
if ever earth showd all her store
view her discolourd budding floore
here her glad eye she largely feedes
and stands mongst them as they mong weeds
the flowers in their best aray
as to their queen their tribute pay
and freely to her lap proscribe
a daughter out of evry tribe
thus as she moves they all bequeath
at once the incense of their breath


the noble heliotropian
now turnes to her and knowes no sun
and as her glorious face doth vary
so opens loyall golden mary
who if but glanced from her sight
straight shuts again as it were night
the violet else lost ith heap
doth spread fresh purple for each step
with whose humility possest
sh inthrones the poore girle in her breast
the julyflowr that hereto thrivd
knowing her self no longerlivd
but for one look of her upheaves
then stead of teares straight sheds her leaves


now the rich robed tulip who
clad all in tissue close doth woe
her sweet to th eye but smelling sower
she gathers to adorn her bower
but the proud honysuckle spreads
like a pavilion her heads
contemnes the wanting commonalty
that but to two ends usefull be
and to her lips thus aptly plact
with smell and hue presents her tast
so all their due obedience pay
each thronging to be in her way
faire amarantha with her eye
thanks those that live which else would dye
the rest in silken fetters bound
by crowning her are crown and crownd
and now the sun doth higher rise
our flora to the meadow hies


the poore distressed heifers low
and as sh approacheth gently bow
begging her charitable leasure
to strip them of their milkie treasure
out of the yeomanry oth heard
with grave aspect and feet prepard
a revrend ladycow drawes neare
bids amarantha welcome here
and from her privy purse lets fall
a pearle or two which seemes to call
this adornd adored fayry
to the banquet of her dayry
soft amarantha weeps to see
mongst men such inhumanitie
that those who do receive in hay
and pay in silver twice a day
should by their cruell barbrous theft
be both of that and life bereft
but tis decreed when ere this dies
that she shall fall a sacrifice
unto the gods since those that trace
her stemme show tis a godlike race
descending in an even line
from heifers and from steeres divine
making the honourd extract full
in io and europas bull
she was the largest goodliest beast
that ever mead or altar blest
round was her udder and more white
then is the milkie way in night
her full broad eye did sparkle fire
her breath was sweet as kind desire
and in her beauteous crescent shone
bright as the argenthorned moone


but see this whiteness is obscure
cynthia spotted she impure
her body writheld and her eyes
departing lights at obsequies
her lowing hot to the fresh gale
her breath perfumes the field withall
to those two suns that ever shine
to those plump parts she doth inshrine
to th hovering snow of either hand
that love and cruelty command
after the breakfast on her teat
she takes her leave oth mournfull neat
who by her toucht now prizeth her life
worthy alone the hollowed knife
into the neighbring wood shes gone
whose roofe defies the telltale sunne
and locks out evry prying beame
close by the lips of a cleare streame
she sits and entertaines her eye
with the moist chrystall and the frye
with burnishtsilver mald whose oares
amazed still make to the shoares
what need she other bait or charm
what hook or angle but her arm
the happy captive gladly tan
sues ever to be slave in vaine
who instantly confirmd ins feares
hasts to his element of teares
from hence her various windings roave
to a wellorderd stately grove


this is the pallace of the wood
and court oth royall oake where stood
the whole nobility the pine
strait ash tall firre and wanton vine
the proper cedar and the rest
here she her deeper senses blest
admires great nature in this pile
floord with greenevelvet camomile
garnisht with gems of unset fruit
supplyd still with a self recruit
her bosom wrought with pretty eyes
of neverplanted strawberries
where th winged musick of the ayre
do richly feast and for their fare
each evening in a silent shade
bestow a gratefull serenade
thus evn tyerd with delight
sated in soul and appetite
full of the purple plumme and peare
the golden apple with the faire
grape that mirth fain would have taught her
and nuts which squirrells cracking brought her
she softly layes her weary limbs
whilst gentle slumber now beginnes
to draw the curtaines of her eye
when straight awakend with a crie
and bitter groan again reposes
again a deep sigh interposes
and now she heares a trembling voyce
ah can there ought on earth rejoyce
why weares she this gay livery
not black as her dark entrails be


can trees be green and to the ayr
thus prostitute their flowing hayr
why do they sprout not witherd dy
must each thing live save wretched i
can dayes triumph in blew and red
when both their light and life is fled
fly joy on wings of popinjayes
to courts of fools where as your playes
dye laught at and forgot whilst all
thats good mourns at this funerall
weep all ye graces and you sweet
quire that at the hill inspird meet
love put thy tapers out that we
and th world may seem as blind as thee
and be since she is lost ah wound
not heavn it self by any found
now as a prisoner new cast
who sleepes in chaines that night his last
next morn is wakt with a repreeve
and from his trance not dream bid live
wonders his sence not having scope
who speaks his friend or his false hope
so amarantha heard but feare
dares not yet trust her tempting care
and as againe her arms oth ground
spread pillows for her head a sound
more dismall makes a swift divorce
and starts her thusrage rapine force
ye blewflamd daughters oth abysse
bring all your snakes here let them hisse


let not a leaf its freshnesse keep
blast all their roots and as you creepe
and leave behind your deadly slime
poyson the budding branch ins prime
wast the proud bowers of this grove
that fiends may dwell in it and move
as in their proper hell whilst she
above laments this tragedy
yet pities not our fate oh faire
vowbreaker now betrothd to th ayr
why by those lawes did we not die
as live but one lucasta why
as he lucasta namd a groan
strangles the fainting passing tone
but as she heard lucasta smiles
posses her round shes slipt mean whiles
behind the blind of a thick bush
when each word tempring with a blush
she gently thus bespake sad swaine
if mates in woe do ease our pain
heres one full of that antick grief
which stifled would for ever live
but told expires pray then reveale
to show our wound is half to heale
what mortall nymph or deity
bewail you thus who ere you be
the shepheard sight my woes i crave
smotherd in me me in my grave
yet be in show or truth a saint
or fiend breath anthemes heare my plaint
for her and thy breaths symphony
which now makes full the harmony


above and to whose voice the spheres
listen and call her musick theirs
this was i blest on earth with so
as druids amorous did grow
jealous of both for as one day
this star as yet but set in clay


they steept her in the hollowed brooke
which from her humane nature tooke
and straight to heaven with winged feare
thus ravisht with her ravish her
the nymph replyd this holy rape
became the gods whose obscure shape
they clothd with light whilst ill you grieve
your better life should ever live


and weep that she to whom you wish
what heavn could give has all its blisse
calling her angell here yet be
sad at this true divinity
shes for the altar not the skies
whom first you crowne then sacrifice
fond man thus to a precipice
aspires till at the top his eyes
have lost the safety of the plain
then begs of fate the vales againe
the now confounded shepheard cries
ye allconfounding destines
how did you make that voice so sweet
without that glorious form to it
thou sacred spirit of my deare
where ere thou hoverst ore us hear
imbark thee in the lawrell tree
and a new phebus follows thee
who stead of all his burning rayes
will strive to catch thee with his layes


or if within the orient vine
thou art both deity and wine
but if thou takest the mirtle grove
that paphos is thou queene of love
and i thy swain who else must die
by no beasts but thy cruelty
but you are rougher than the winde
are souls on earth then heavn more kind
imprisoned in mortality
lucasta would have answered me
lucasta amarantha said
is she that virginstar a maid
except her prouder livery
in beauty poore and cheap as i
whose glory like a meteor shone
or aery apparition
admird a while but slighted known
fierce as the chafed lyon hies
he rowses him and to her flies
thinking to answer with his speare
now as in warre intestine where
ith mist of a black battell each
layes at his next then makes a breach
through th entrayles of another whom
he sees nor knows whence he did come
guided alone by rage and th drumme
but stripping and impatient wild
he finds too soon his onely child
so our expiring desprate lover
fard when amazd he did discover


lucasta in this nymph his sinne
darts the accursed javelin
gainst his own breast which she puts by
with a soft lip and gentle eye
then closes with him on the ground
and now her smiles have heald his wound


but not untill those heavy crimes
she hath kisd off a thousand times
who not contented with this pain
doth threaten to offend again
and now they gaze and sigh and weep
whilst each cheek doth the others steep
whilst tongues as exorcisd are calm
onely the rhetrick of the palm
prevailing pleads untill at last
theyre chaind in one another fast
lucasta to him doth relate
her various chance and diffring fate
how chacd by hydraphil and tract
the numrous foe to philanact


who whilst they for the same things fight
as bards decrees and druids rite
for safeguard of their proper joyes
and shepheards freedome each destroyes
the glory of this sicilie
since seeking thus the remedie
they fancy building on false ground
the means must them and it confound
yet are resolved to stand or fall
and win a little or lose all


from this sad storm of fire and blood
she fled to this yet living wood
where she mongst savage beasts doth find
her self more safe then humane kind
then she relates how caelia
the ladyhere strippes her array
and girdles her in homespunne bayes
then makes her conversant in layes
of birds and swaines more innocent
that kenne not guile nor courtship ment


now walks she to her bowr to dine
under a shade of eglantine
upon a dish of natures cheere
which both grew drest and servd up there
that done she feasts her smell with poses
pluckt from the damask cloath of roses
which there continually doth stay
and onely frost can take away
then wagers which hath most content
her eye eare hand her gust or sent
intranct alexis sees and heares
as walking above all the spheres
knows and adores this and is wilde
untill with her he live thus milde
so that which to his thoughts he meant
for losse of her a punishment
his armes hung up and his sword broke
his ensignes folded he betook
himself unto the humble crook
and for a full reward of all
she now doth him her shepheard call
and in a see of flowrs install
then gives her faith immediately
which he returns religiously


both vowing in her peacefull cave
to make their bridallbed and grave
but the true joy this pair conceivd
each from the other first bereavd
and then found after such alarmes
fastpiniond in each others armes
ye panting virgins that do meet
your loves within their winding sheet
breathing and constant still evn there
or souls their bodies in yon sphere
or angels men returnd from hell
and separated mindescan tell


if in me anger or disdaine
in you or both made me refraine
from th noble intercourse of verse
that only vertuous thoughts rehearse
then chaste ellinda might you feare
the sacred vowes that i did sweare


but if alone some pious thought
me to an inward sadnesse brought
thinking to breath your soule too welle
my tongue was charmed with that spell
and left it since there was no roome
to voyce your worth enough strooke dumbe


so then this silence doth reveal
no thought of negligence but zeal
for as in adoration
this is loves true devotion
children and fools the words repeat
but anchrites pray in tears and sweat


thou snowy farme with thy five tenements
tell thy white mistris here was one
that calld to pay his dayly rents
but she agathering flowrs and hearts is gone
and thou left voyd to rude possession


but grieve not pretty ermin cabinet
thy alabaster lady will come home
if not what tenant can there fit
the slender turnings of thy narrow roome
but must ejected be by his owne dombe


then give me leave to leave my rent with thee
five kisses one unto a place
for though the lutes too high for me
yet servants knowing minikin nor base
are still allowd to fiddle with the case


for cherries plenty and for corans
enough for fifty were there more ons
for elles of beere flutes of canary
that well did wash downe pastiesmary
for peason chickens sawces high
pig and the widdowvensonpye
with certaine promise to your brother
of the virginity of another
where it is thought i too may peepe in
with knuckles far as any deepe in
for glasses heads hands bellies full
of wine and loyne rightworshipfull
whether all of or more behinda
thankes freest freshest faire ellinda


thankes for my visit not disdaining
or at the least thankes for your feigning
for if your mercy doore were locktwell
i should be justly soundly knocktwell
cause that in dogrell i did mutter
not one rhime to you from damrotter


next beg i to present my duty
to pregnant sister in prime beauty
whom well i deeme ere few months elder
will take out hans from pretty kelder
and to the sweetly fayre mabella
a match that vies with arabella
in each respect but the misfortune
fortune fate i thee importune


nor must i passe the lovely alice
whose health id quaffe in golden chalice
but since that fate hath made me neuter
i only can in beaker pewter
but whod forget or yet left unsung
the doughty acts of george the yongson


who yesterday to save his sister
had slaine the snake had he not mist her
but i shall leave him till a nag on
he gets to prosecute the dragon
and then with helpe of sun and taper
fill with his deeds twelve reames of paper
that amadis sir guy and topaz
with his fleet neigher shall keep nopace


how i grieve that i am well
all my health was in my sicknes
go then destiny and tell
very death is in this quicknes


such a fate rules over me
that i glory when i languish
and do blesse the remedy
that doth feed not quench my anguish


twas a gentle warmth that ceasd
in the vizard of a feavor
but i feare now i am easd
all the flames since i must leave her


joyes though witherd circled me
when unto her voice inured
like those who by harmony
only can be throughly cured


sweet sure was that malady
whilst the pleasant angel hoverd
which ceasing they are all as i
angry that they are recoverd


and as men in hospitals
that are maimd are lodgd and dined
but when once their danger fals
ah th are healed to be pined


fainting so i might before
sometime have the leave to hand her
but lusty am beat out of dore
and for love compelld to wander


it was amyntors grove that chloris
for ever ecchoes and her glories
chloris the gentlest sheapherdesse
that ever lawnes and lambes did blesse
her breath like to the whispering winde
was calme as thought sweet as her minde
her lips like coral gates kept in
the perfume and the pearle within
her eyes a doubleflaming torch
that alwayes shine and never scorch
her selfe the heavn in which did meet
the all of bright of faire and sweet
here was i brought with that delight
that seperated soules take flight
and when my reason calld my sence
back somewhat from this excellence


that i could see i did begin
t observe the curious ordering
of every roome where ts hard to know
which most excels in sent or show
arabian gummes do breathe here forth
and th easts come over to the north
the windes have brought their hyre of sweet
to see amyntor chloris greet
balme and nard and each perfume
to blesse this payre chafe and consume
and th phoenix see already fries
her neast a fire in chloris eyes
next the great and powerful hand
beckens my thoughts unto a stand
of titian raphael georgone
whose art even nature hath outdone
for if weake nature only can
intend not perfect what is man
these certainely we must prefer
who mended what she wrought and her


and sure the shadowes of those rare
and kind incomparable fayre
are livelier nobler company
then if they could or speake or see
for these i aske without a tush
can kisse or touch without a blush
and we are taught that substance is
if uninjoyd but th shade of blisse
now every saint cleerly divine
is closd so in her severall shrine
the gems so rarely richly set
for them wee love the cabinet


so intricately plact withall
as if th imbrordered the wall
so that the pictures seemd to be
but one continued tapistrie
after this travell of mine eyes
we sate and pitied dieties
wee bound our loose hayre with the vine
the poppy and the eglantine
one swelld an oriental bowle
full as a grateful loyal soule
to chloris chloris heare oh heare
tis pledgd above in evry sphere
now streight the indians richest prize
is kindled in glad sacrifice
cloudes are sent up on wings of thyme
amber pomgranates jessemine
and through our earthen conduicts sore
higher then altars fumd before
so drencht we our oppressing cares
and choakt the wide jawes of our feares
whilst ravisht thus we did devise
if this were not a paradice
in all except these harmlesse sins
behold flew in two cherubins
cleare as the skye from whence they came
and brighter than the sacred flame
the boy adornd with modesty
yet armed so with majesty
that if the thunderer againe
his eagle sends she stoops in vaine


besides his innocence he tooke
a sword and casket and did looke
like love in armes he wrote but five
yet spake eighteene each grace did strive
and twenty cupids thronged forth
who first should shew his prettier worth
but oh the nymph did you ere know
carnation mingled with snow
or have you seene the lightning shrowd
and straight breake through th opposing cloud
so ran her blood such was its hue
so through her vayle her bright haire flew
and yet its glory did appeare
but thinne because her eyes were neere
blooming boy and blossoming mayd
may your faire sprigges be neere betrayd


to eating worme or fouler storme
no serpent lurke to do them harme
no sharpe frost cut no northwinde teare
the verdure of that fragrant hayre
but may the sun and gentle weather
when you are both growne ripe together
load you with fruit such as your father
from you with all the joyes doth gather
and may you when one branch is dead
graft such another in its stead
lasting thus ever in your prime
till th sithe is snatcht away from time


why shouldst thou sweare i am forsworn
since thine i vowd to be
lady it is already morn
and twas last night i swore to thee
that fond impossibility


have i not lovd thee much and long
a tedious twelve moneths space
i should all other beauties wrong
and rob thee of a new imbrace
should i still dote upon thy face


not but all joy in thy browne haire
in others may be found
but i must search the black and faire
like skilfulle minerallists that sound
for treasure in unplowdup ground


then if when i have lovd my round
thou provst the pleasant she
with spoyles of meaner beauties crownd
i laden will returne to thee
evn sated with varietie


i saw a little diety
minerva in epitomy
whom venus at first blush surprisd
tooke for her winged wagge disguisd
but viewing then whereas she made
not a distrest but lively shade
of eccho whom he had betrayd
now wanton and ith coole oth sunne
with her delight a hunting gone
and thousands more whom he had slaine
to live and love belovd againe
ah this is true divinity
i will ungod that toye crid she


then markt she syrinx running fast
to pans imbraces with the haste
shee fled him once whose reedepipe rent
he finds now a new instrument
theseus returnd invokes the ayre
and windes then wafts his faire
whilst ariadne ravisht stood
half in his armes halfe in the flood
proud anaxerete doth fall
at iphis feete who smiles at all
and he whilst she his curles doth deck
hangs no where now but on her neck
here phoebus with a beame untombes
longhid leucothoe and doomes
her father there daphne the faire
knowes now no bayes but round her haire


and to apollo and his sons
who pay him their due orisons
bequeaths her lawrellrobe that flame
contemnes thunder and evill fame
there kneeld adonis fresh as spring
gay as his youth now offering
herself those joyes with voice and hand
which first he could not understand
transfixed venus stood amasd
full of the boy and love she gazd
and in imbraces seemed more
senceless and colde then he before
uselesse childe in vaine said she
you beare that fond artillerie
see heere a powr above the slow
weake execution of thy bow
so said she rivd the wood in two
unedged all his arrowes too


and with the string their feathers bound
to that part whence we have our wound
see see the darts by which we burnd
are bright loysas pencills turnd
with which she now enliveth more
beauties than they destroyd before


were it that you so shun me cause you wish
cruelst a fellow in your wretchednesse
or that you take some small ease in your owne
torments to heare another sadly groane
i were most happy in my paines to be
so truely blest to be so curst by thee
but oh my cries to that doe rather adde
of which too much already thou hast had
and thou art gladly sad to heare my moane
yet sadly hearst me with derision


thou most unjust that really dust know
and feelst thyselfe the flames i burne in oh
how can you beg to be set loose from that
consuming stake you binde another at


uncharitablest both wayes to denie
that pity me for which yourself must dye
to love not her loves you yet know the pain
what tis to love and not be lovd againe


flye on flye on swift racer untill she
whom thou of all adorst shall learne of thee
the pace toutfly thee and shall teach thee groan
what terrour tis toutgo and be outgon


nor yet looke back nor yet must we
run then like spoakes in wheeles eternally
and never overtake be draggd on still
by the weake cordage of your untwind will
round without hope of rest no i will turne
and with my goodnes boldly meete your scorne


my goodnesse which heavn pardon and that fate
made you hate love and fall in love with hate


but i am changd bright reason that did give
my soule a noble quicknes made me live
one breath yet longer and to will and see
hath reacht me powr to scorne as well as thee
that thou which proudly tramplest on my grave
thyselfe mightst fall conquerd my double slave
that thou mightst sinking in thy triumphs moan
and i triumph in my destruction


hayle holy cold chaste temper hayle the fire
ravd ore my purer thoughts i feel t expire
and i am candied ice yee powrs if ere
i shall be forct unto my sepulcher
or violently hurld into my urne
oh make me choose rather to freeze than burne


oh thou that swingst upon the waving eare
of some wellfilled oaten beard
drunk evry night with a delicious teare
dropt thee from heavn where now thart reard


the joyes of earth and ayre are thine intire
that with thy feet and wings dost hop and flye
and when thy poppy workes thou dost retire
to thy carvd acornbed to lye


up with the day the sun thou welcomst then
sportst in the guilt plats of his beames
and all these merry dayes makst merry men
thy selfe and melancholy streames


but ah the sickle golden eares are cropt
ceres and bacchus bid goodnight
sharpe frosty fingers all your flowrs have topt
and what sithes spard winds shave off quite


poore verdant foole and now green ice thy joys
large and as lasting as thy peirch of grasse
bid us lay in gainst winter raine and poize
their flouds with an oerflowing glasse


thou best of men and friends we will create
a genuine summer in each others breast
and spite of this cold time and frosen fate
thaw us a warme seate to our rest


our sacred harthes shall burne eternally
as vestal flames the northwind he
shall strike his froststretchd winges dissolve and flye
this aetna in epitome


dropping december shall come weeping in
bewayle th usurping of his raigne
but when in showrs of old greeke we beginne
shall crie he hath his crowne againe


night as cleare hesper shall our tapers whip
from the light casements where we play
and the darke hagge from her black mantle strip
and sticke there everlasting day


thus richer then untempted kings are we
that asking nothing nothing need
though lord of all what seas imbrace yet he
that wants himselfe is poore indeed


hither with hallowed steps as is the ground
that must enshrine this saint with lookes profound
and sad aspects as the dark vails you weare
virgins opprest draw gently gently neare
enter the dismall chancell of this rooome
where each pale guest stands fixt a living tombe
with trembling hands helpe to remove this earth
to its last death and first victorious birth
let gums and incense fume who are at strife
to enter th hearse and breath in it new life
mingle your steppes with flowers as you goe
which as they haste to fade will speake your woe


and when y have plact your tapers on her urn
how poor a tribute tis to weep and mourn
that flood the channell of your eyelids fils
when you lose trifles or whats lesse your wills


if youl be worthy of these obsequies
be blind unto the world and drop your eyes
waste and consume burn downward as this fire
thats fed no more so willingly expire


passe through the cold and obscure narrow way
then light your torches at the spring of day


there with her triumph in your victory
such joy alone and such solemnity
becomes this funerall of virginity


or if you faint to be so blest oh heare
if not to dye dare but to live like her
dare to live virgins till the honourd age
of thrice fifteen cals matrons on the stage
whilst not a blemish or least staine is scene
on your white roabe twixt fifty and fifteene
but as it in your swathingbands was given
bringt in your winding sheet unsoyld to heavn
daere to do purely without compact good
or herald by no one understood
but him who now in thanks bows either knee
for th early benefit and secresie


dare to affect a serious holy sorrow
to which delights of pallaces are narrow
and lasting as their smiles dig you a roome
where practise the probation of your tombe
with everbended knees and piercing prayr
smooth the rough passe through craggy earth to ayr


may put in safely and secure their feares
who adding to your joyes now owe you theirs


virgins if thus you dare but courage take
to follow her in life else through this lake
of nature wade and breake her earthly bars
y are fixt with her upon a throne of stars
arched with a pure heavn chrystaline
where round you love and joy for ever shine


but you are dumbe as what you do lament
more senseles then her very monument
which at your weaknes weeps spare that vaine teare
enough to burst the revrend sepulcher
rise and walk home there groaning prostrate fall
and celebrate your owne sad funerall
for howsoere you move may heare or see
you are more dead and buried then shee


you that shall live awhile before
old time tyrs and is no more
when that this ambitious stone
stoopes low as what it tramples on
know that in that age when sinne
gave the world law and governd queene
a virgin livd that still put on
white thoughts though out of fashion


that tract the stars spite of report
and durst be good though chidden fort
of such a soule that infant heavn
repented what it thus had givn
for finding equall happy man
th impatient powrs snatch it agen
thus chaste as th ayre whither shees fled
she making her celestiall bed
in her warme alablaster lay
as cold is in this house of clay
nor were the rooms unfit to feast
or circumscribe this angelguest


the radiant gemme was brightly set
in as divine a carkanet
of which the clearer was not knowne
her minde or her complexion
such an everlasting grace
such a beatifick face
incloysters here this narrow floore
that possest all hearts before


blest and bewayld in death and birth
the smiles and teares of heavn and earth
virgins at each step are afeard
filmer is shot by which they steerd
their star extinct their beauty dead
that the yong world to honour led
but see the rapid spheres stand still
and tune themselves unto her will


thus although this marble must
as all things crumble into dust
and though you finde this fairebuilt tombe
ashes as what lyes in its wombe
yet her saintlike name shall shine
a living glory to this shrine
and her eternall fame be read
when all but very vertues dead


see what a clouded majesty and eyes
whose glory through their mist doth brighter rise
see what an humble bravery doth shine
and griefe triumphant breaking through each line
how it commands the face so sweet a scorne
never did happy misery adorne


so sacred a contempt that others show
to this oth height of all the wheele below
that mightiest monarchs by this shaded booke
may coppy out their proudest richest looke


whilst the true eaglet this quick luster spies
and by his suns enlightens his owne eyes
he cures his cares his burthen feeles then streight
joyes that so lightly he can beare such weight
whilst either eithers passion doth borrow
and both doe grieve the same victorious sorrow


these my best lilly with so bold a spirit
and soft a grace as if thou didst inherit
for that time all their greatnesse and didst draw
with those brave eyes your royal sitters saw


not as of old when a rough hand did speake
a strong aspect and a faire face a weake
when only a black beard cried villaine and
by hieroglyphicks we could understand
when chrystall typified in a white spot
and the bright ruby was but one red blot
thou dost the things orientally the same
not only paintst its colour but its flame


thou sorrow canst designe without a teare
and with the man his very hope or feare
so that th amazed world shall henceforth finde
none but my lilly ever drew a minde


with that delight the royal captivs brought
before the throne to breath his farewell thought
to tel his last tale and so end with it
which gladly he esteemes a benefit
when the brave victor at his great soule dumbe
findes something there fate cannot overcome
cals the chaind prince and by his glory led
first reaches him his crowne and then his head
who nere til now thinks himself slave and poor
for though nought else he had himselfe before
he weepes at this faire chance nor wil allow
but that the diadem doth brand his brow


and underrates himselfe below mankinde
who first had lost his body now his minde


with such a joy came i to heare my dombe
and haste the preparation of my tombe
when like good angels who have heavnly charge
to steere and guide mans sudden giddy barge
she snatcht me from the rock i was upon
and landed me at lifes pavillion
where i thus wound out of th immense abysse
was straight set on a pinacle of blisse


let me leape in againe and by that fall
bring me to my first woe so cancel all
ah s this a quitting of the debt you owe
to crush her and her goodnesse at one blowe
defend me from so foule impiety
would make friends grieve and furies weep to see


now ye sage spirits which infuse in men
that are oblidgd twice to oblige agen
informe my tongue in labour what to say
and in what coyne or language to repay
but you are silent as the evnings ayre
when windes unto their hollow grots repaire
oh then accept the all that left me is
devout oblations of a sacred wish


when she walks forth ye perfumd wings oth east
fan her til with the sun she hastes to th west
and when her heavnly course calles up the day
and breakes as bright descend some glistering ray
to circle her and her as glistering haire
that all may say a living saint shines there


slow time with woollen feet make thy soft pace
and leave no tracks ith snow of her pure face
but when this vertue must needs fall to rise
the brightest constellation in the skies
when we in characters of fire shall reade
how cleere she was alive how spotless dead
all you that are a kinne to piety
for onely you can her close mourners be
draw neer and make of hallowed teares a dearth
goodnes and justice both are fled the earth


if this be to be thankful iv a heart
broaken with vowes eaten with grateful smart
and beside this the vild world nothing hath
worth anything but her provoked wrath
so then who thinkes to satisfie in time
must give a satisfaction for that crime
since she alone knowes the gifts value she
can onely to her selfe requitall be


and worthyly to th life paynt her owne story
in its true colours and full native glory
which when perhaps she shal be heard to tell
buffoones and theeves ceasing to do ill
shal blush into a virgininnocence
and then woo others from the same offence
the robber and the murderer in spite
of his red spots shal startle into white
all good rewards layd by shal stil increase
for love of her and villany decease
naught be ignote not so much out of feare
of being punisht as offending her


so that when as my future daring bayes
shall bow it selfe in lawrels to her praise
to crown her conquring goodnes and proclaime
the due renowne and glories of her name
my wit shal be so wretched and so poore
that stead of praysing i shal scandal her
and leave when with my purest art iv done
scarce the designe of what she is begunne
yet men shal send me home admird exact
proud that i could from her so wel detract


where then thou bold instinct shal i begin
my endlesse taske to thanke her were a sin
great as not speake and not to speake a blame
beyond whats worst such as doth want a name
so thou my all poore gratitude evn thou
in this wilt an unthankful office do


or wilt i fling all at her feet i have
my life my love my very soule a slave
tye my free spirit onely unto her
and yeeld up my affection prisoner
fond thought in this thou teachest me to give
what first was hers since by her breath i live
and hast but showd me how i may resigne
possession of those thing are none of mine


this queen of prey now prey to you
fast to that pirch of ivory
in silver chaines and silken clue
hath now made full thy victory


the swelling admirall of the dread
cold deepe burnt in thy flames oh faire
wast not enough but thou must lead
bound too the princesse of the aire


unarmd of wings and scaly oare
unhappy crawler on the land
to what heavn flyst divst to what shoare
that her brave eyes do not command


ascend the chariot of the sun
from her bright powr to shelter thee
her captive foole outgases him
ah what lost wretches then are we


now proud usurpers on the right
of sacred beauty heare your dombe
recant your sex your mastry might
lower you cannot be orecome


repent ye ere namd he or head
for y are in falcons monarchy
and in that just dominion bred
in which the nobler is the shee


a gentleman to give us somewhat new
hath brought up oxford with him to show you
pray be not frightedtho the scaene and gowns
the universities the wits the towns
the lines each honest englishman may speake
yet not mistake his mothertongue for greeke
for stil twas part of his vowd liturgie
from learned comedies deliver me
wishing all those that lovd em here asleepe
promising scholars but no scholarship


youd smile to see how he dos vex and shake
speakes naught but if the prologue dos but take
or the first act were past the pikes once then
then hopes and joys then frowns and fears agen
then blushes like a virgin now to be
robd of his comicall virginity
in presence of you all in short youd say
more hopes of mirth are in his looks then play


these feares are for the noble and the wise
but if mongst you there are such fowle dead eyes
as can damne unaraignd cal law their powrs
judging it sin enough that it is ours
and with the house shift their decreed desires
faire still to th blacke blacke still to the whitefryers


so far from quarrlling with himselfe and wit
that he wil thank them for the benefit
since finding nothing worthy of their hate
they reach him that themselves must envy at


the stubborne author of the trifle crime
that just now cheated you of two hours time
presumptuous it likt him began to grow
carelesse whether it pleased you or no


but we who ground th excellence of a play
on what the women at the dores wil say
who judge it by the benches and afford
to take your money ere his oath or word
his schollars schoold sayd if he had been wise
he should have wove in one two comedies


the first for th gallery in which the throne
to their amazement should descend alone
the rosinlightning flash and monster spire
squibs and words hotter then his fire


th other for the gentlemen oth pit
like to themselves all spirit fancy wit
in which plots should be subtile as a flame
disguises would make proteus stil the same
humours so rarely humourd and exprest
that evn they should thinke em so not drest
vices acted and applauded too times
tickled and th actors acted not their crimes
so he might equally applause have gaind
of th hardned sooty and the snowy hand


where now one so so spatters tother no
tis his first play twere solecisme tshould goe
the next t showd pritily but searcht within
it appeares bare and bald as is his chin
the townewit sentences a scholars play
pish i know not why but thave not the way


we whose gaine is all our pleasure evn these
are bound by justice and religion to please
which he whose pleasures all his gaine goes by
as slightly as they doe his comaedy


culls out the few the worthy at whose feet
he sacrifices both himselfe and it
his fancies first fruits profit he knowes none
unles that of your approbation
which if your thoughts at going out will pay
heel not looke farther for a second day


vnhappy youth betrayd by fate
to such a love hath sainted hate
and damned those celestiall bands
are onely knit with equal hands
the love of great ones is a love
gods are incapable to prove
for where there is a joy uneven
there never never can be heavn


tis such a love as is not sent
to fiends as yet for punishment
ixion willingly doth feele
the gyre of his eternal wheele
nor would he now exchange his paine
for cloudes and goddesses againe


wouldst thou with tempests lye then bow
to th rougher furrows of her brow
or make a thunderbolt thy choyce
then catch at her more fatal voyce
or gender with the lightning trye
the subtler flashes of her eye
poore semele wel knew the same
who both imbract her god and flame
and not alone in soule did burne
but in this love did ashes turne


how il doth majesty injoy
the bow and gaity oth boy
as if the purpleroabe should sit
and sentence give ith chayr of wit


say everdying wretch to whom
each answer is a certaine doom
what is it that you would possesse
the countes or the naked besse
would you her gowne or title do
her box or gem the thing or show
if you meane her the very her
abstracted from her caracter
unhappy boy you may as soone
with fawning wanton with the moone
or with an amorous complaint
get prostitute your very saint


not that we are not mortal or
fly venus altars and abhor
the selfesame knack for which you pine
but we defend us are divine
not female but madam born and come
from a righthonourable wombe
shal we then mingle with the base
and bring a silvertinsell race
whilst th issue noble wil not passe
the gold alloyd almost halfe brasse
and th blood in each veine doth appeare
part thick booreinn part lady cleare


like to the sordid insects sprung
from father sun and mother dung
yet lose we not the hold we have
but faster graspe the trembling slave


play at baloon withs heart and winde
the strings like scaines steale into his minde
ten thousand false and feigned joyes
far worse then they whilst like whipt boys
this heard sir play stil in her eyes
and be a dying live like flyes
caught by their anglelegs and whom
the torch laughs peecemeale to consume


when love with unconfined wings
hovers within my gates
and my divine althea brings
to whisper at the grates
when i lye tangled in her haire
and fetterd to her eye
the birds that wanton in the aire
know no such liberty


when flowing cups run swiftly round
with no allaying thames
our carelesse heads with roses bound
our hearts with loyal flames
when thirsty griefe in wine we steepe
when healths and draughts go free
fishes that tipple in the deepe
know no such libertie


when like committed linnets i
with shriller throat shall sing
the sweetnes mercy majesty
and glories of my king
when i shall voyce aloud how good
he is how great should be
inlarged winds that curle the flood
know no such liberty


stone walls doe not a prison make
nor iron bars a cage
mindes innocent and quiet take
that for an hermitage
if i have freedome in my love
and in my soule am free
angels alone that sore above
enjoy such liberty


now the peace is made at the foes rate
whilst men of armes to kettles their old helmes translate
and drinke in caskes of honourable plate
in evry hand let a cup be found
that from all hearts a health may sound
to goring to goring see t goe round


he whose glories shine so brave and high
that captive they in triumph leade each care and eye
claiming uncombated the victorie
and from the earth to heavn rebound
fixt there eternall as this round
to goring to goring see him crownd


to his lovely bride in love with scars
whose eyes wound deepe in peace as doth his sword in wars
they shortly must depose the queen of stars
her cheekes the morning blushes give
and the benighted world repreeve
to lettice to lettice let her live


give me scorching heat thy heat dry sun
that to this payre i may drinke off an ocean
yet leave my grateful thirst unquensht undone
or a full bowle of heavnly wine
in which dissolved stars should shine
to the couple to the couple th are divine


heark faire one how what ere here is
doth laugh and sing at thy distresse
not out of hate to thy reliefe
but joy t enjoy thee though in griefe


see that which chaynes you you chaine here
the prison is thy prisoner
how much thy jaylors keeper art
he bindes your hands but you his heart


the gyves to rase so smooth a skin
are so unto themselves within
but blest to kisse so fayre an arme
haste to be happy with that harme


and play about thy wanton wrist
as if in them thou so wert drest
but if too rough too hard they presse
oh they but closely closely kisse


and as thy bare feet blesse the way
the people doe not mock but pray
and call thee as amasd they run
instead of prostitute a nun


the merry torch burnes with desire
to kindle the eternall fire
and lightly daunces in thine eyes
to tunes of epithalamies


the sheets tyd ever to thy wast
how thankfull to be so imbract
and see thy very very bonds
are bound to thee to binde such hands


if teares could wash the ill away
a pearle for each wet bead id pay
but as dewd corne the fuller growes
so waterd eyes but swell our woes


one drop another cals which still
griefe adding fuell doth distill
too fruitfull of her selfe is anguish
we need no cherishing to languish


coward fate degenrate man
like little children uses when
he whips us first untill we weepe
then cause we still a weeping keepe


then from thy firme selfe never swerve
teares fat the griefe that they should sterve
iron decrees of destinie
are nere wipet out with a wet eye


but this way you may gaine the field
oppose but sorrow and twill yield
one gallant thoroughmade resolve
doth starry influence dissolve


this is the prittiest motion
madam th alarums of a drumme
that cals your lord set to your cries
to mine are sacred symphonies


what though tis said i have a voice
i know tis but that hollow noise
which as it through my pipe doth speed
bitterns do carol through a reed
in the same key with monkeys jiggs
or dirges of proscribed piggs
or the soft serenades above
in calme of night when cats make love


was ever such a consort seen
fourscore and fourteen with forteen
yet sooner theyl agree one paire
then we in our springwinter aire
they may imbrace sigh kiss the rest
our breath knows nought but east and west
thus have i heard to childrens cries
the faire nurse still such lullabies
that well all sayd for what there lay
the pleasure did the sorrow pay


sure thers another way to save
your phansiemadam thats to have
tis but a petitioning kinde fate
the organs sent to bilingsgate
where they to that soft murmring quire
shall teach you all you can admire
or do but heare how lovebang kate
in pantry darke for freage of mate
with edge of steele the square wood shapes
and dido to it chaunts or scrapes
the merry phaeton oth carre
youl vow makes a melodious jarre


sweeter and sweeter whisleth he
to unanointed axeltree
such swift notes he and s wheels do run
for me i yeeld him phaebus son
say faire comandres can it be
you should ordaine a mutinie
for where i howle all accents fall
as kings harangues to one and all


ulisses art is now withstood
you ravish both with sweet and good
saint syren sing for i dare heare
but when i ope oh stop your eare


far lesse bet aemulation
to passe me or in trill or tone
like the thin throat of philomel
and the smart lute who should excell
as if her soft cords should begin
and strive for sweetnes with the pin


yet can i musick too but such
as is beyond all voice or touch
my minde can in faire order chime
whilst my true heart still beats the time
my soules so full of harmonie
that it with all parts can agree


if you winde up to the highest fret
it shall descend an eight from it
and when you shall vouchsafe to fall
sixteene above you it shall call
and yet so disassenting one
they both shall meet in unison


come then bright cherubin begin
my loudest musick is within
take all notes with your skillfull eyes
hearke if mine do not sympathise
sound all my thoughts and see exprest
the tablature of my large brest
then youl admit that i too can
musick above dead sounds of man
such as alone doth blesse the spheres
not to be reacht with humane eares


come pretty birds present your lays
and learn to chaunt a goddess praise
ye woodnymphs let your voices be
employd to serve her deity
and warble forth ye virgins nine
some music to my valentine


her bosom is loves paradise
there is no heavn but in her eyes
shes chaster than the turtledove
and fairer than the queen of love
yet all perfections do combine
to beautifie my valentine


shes natures choicest cabinet
where honour beauty worth and wit
are all united in her breast
the graces claim an interest
all virtues that are most divine
shine clearest in my valentine


tell me ye subtill judges in loves treasury
inform me which hath most inricht mine eye
this diamonds greatnes or its clarity


ye cloudy spark lights whose vast multitude
of fires are harder to be found then viewd
waite on this star in her first magnitude


calmely or roughly ah she shines too much
that now i lye her influence is such
chrusht with too strong a hand or soft a touch


lovers beware a certaine double harme
waits your proud hopes her looks alkilling charm
guarded by her as true victorious arme


thus with her eyes brave tamyris spake dread
which when the kings dull breast not entered
finding she could not looke she strook him dead


i cannot tell who loves the skeleton
of a poor marmoset nought but boan boan
give me a nakednesse with her cloaths on


such whose whitesattin upper coat of skin
cut upon velvet rich incarnadin
has yet a body and of flesh within


sure it is meant good husbandry in men
who do incorporate with aery leane
t repair their sides and get their ribb agen


hard hap unto that huntsman that decrees
fat joys for all his swet when as he sees
after his say nought but his keepers fees


then love i beg when next thou takst thy bow
thy angry shafts and dost heartchasing go
passe rascall deare strike me the largest doe


comanding asker if it be
pity that you faine would have
then i turne begger unto thee
and aske the thing that thou dost crave
i will suffice thy hungry need
so thou wilt but my fancy feed


in all ill yeares was ever knowne
on so much beauty such a dearth
which in that thricebequeathed gowne
lookes like the sun eclipst with earth
like gold in canvas or with dirt
unsoyled ermins close begirt


yet happy he that can but tast
this whiter skin who thirsty is
fooles dote on sattin motions lacd
the gods go naked in their blisse
at th barrells head there shines the vine
there only relishes the wine


there quench my heat and thou shalt sup
worthy the lips that it must touch
nectar from out the starry cup
i beg thy breath not halfe so much
so both our wants supplied shall be
youl give for love i charity


cheape then are pearleimbroderies
that not adorne but cloud thy wast
thou shalt be cloathd above all prise
if thou wilt promise me imbract
weel ransack neither chest nor shelfe
ill cover thee with mine owne selfe


but cruel if thou dost deny
this necessary almes to me
what softsould man but with his eye
and hand will hence be shut to thee
since all must judge you more unkinde
i starve your body you my minde


you that can haply mixe your joyes with cries
and weave white ios with black elegies
can caroll out a dirge and in one breath
sing to the tune either of life or death
you that can weepe the gladnesse of the spheres
and pen a hymne in stead of inke with teares
here here your unproportiond wit let fall
to celebrate this newborne funerall
and greete that little greatnesse which from th wombe
dropt both a load to th cradle and the tombe


bright soule teach us to warble with what feet
thy swathing linnen and thy winding sheet
weepe or shout forth that fonts solemnitie
which at once christnd and buried thee
and change our shriller passions with that sound
first told thee into th ayre then to the ground


ah wert thou borne for this only to call
the king and queen guests to your buriall
to bid good night your day not yet begun
and shew a setting ere a rising sun


or wouldst thou have thy life a martyrdom
dye in the act of thy religion
fit excellently innocently good
first sealing it with water then thy blood


as when on blazing wings a blest man sores
and having past to god through fiery dores
straight s roabd with flames when the same element
which was his shame proves now his ornament
oh how he hastned death burnt to be fryed
killd twice with each delay till deified


so swift hath been thy race so full of flight
like him condemnd evn aged with a night
cutting all lets with clouds as if th hadst been
like angels plumd and borne a cherubin


or in your journey towards heavn say
tooke you the world a little in your way
sawst and dislikst its vaine pompe then didst flye
up for eternall glories to the skye
like a religious ambitious one
aspiredst for the everlasting crowne


ah holy traytour to your brother prince
robd of his birthright and preheminence
could you ascend yon chaire of state ere him
and snatch from th heire the starry diadem
making your honours now as much uneven
as gods on earth are lesse then saints in heavn


triumph sing triumphs then oh put on all
your richest lookes drest for this festivall
thoughts full of ravisht reverence with eyes
so fixt as when a saint we canonize
clap wings with seraphins before the throne
at this eternall coronation
and teach your soules new mirth such as may be
worthy this birthday to divinity


but ah these blast your feasts the jubilies
we send you up are sad as were our cries
and of true joy we can expresse no more
thus crownd then when we buried thee before


princesse in heavn forgivenes whilst we
resigne our office to the hierarchy

the happy object of her eye

whose amorous tale had so betraid
desire in this alllovely maid
that whilst her check a blush did warm
i read loves story in her form


hearke reader wilt be learnd ith warres
a genrall in a gowne
strike a league with arts and scarres
and snatch from each a crowne


wouldst be a wonder such a one
as should win with a looke
a bishop in a garison
and conquer by the booke


take then this mathematick shield
and henceforth by its rules
be able to dispute ith field
and combate in the schooles


whilst peaceful learning once againe
and the souldier so concord
as that he fights now with her penne
and she writes with his sword

heald wounded states made kings and kingdoms one
that fate should be so merciful to me
to let me live t have said i have read thee

of this tempestuous age this darke worlds sight
oh from thy crowne of glory dart one flame
may strike a sacred reverence whilest thy name
like holy flamens to their god of day
we bowing sing and whilst we praise we pray


bright spirit whose aeternal motion
of wit like time stil in it selfe did run
binding all others in it and did give
commission how far this or that shal live
like destiny of poems who as she
signes death to all her selfe cam never dye


and now thy purplerobed traegedy
in her imbroiderd buskins cals mine eye
where the brave aetius we see betrayd
t obey his death whom thousand lives obeyd
whilst that the mighty foole his scepter breakes
and through his genrals wounds his own doome speakes
weaving thus richly valentinian
the costliest monarch with the cheapest man


souldiers may here to their old glories adde
the lover love and be with reason mad
not as of old alcides furious
who wilder then his bull did teare the house
hurling his language with the canvas stone
twas thought the monster rord the sobrer tone


but ah when thou thy sorrow didst inspire
with passions blacke as is her darke attire
virgins as sufferers have wept to see
so white a soule so red a crueltie
that thou hast grievd and with unthought redresse
drid their wet eyes who now thy mercy blesse
yet loth to lose thy watry jewell when
joy wipt it off laughter straight sprungt agen


now ruddy checked mirth with rosie wings
fans evry brow with gladnesse whilst she sings
delight to all and the whole theatre
a festivall in heaven doth appeare
nothing but pleasure love and like the morne
each face a genral smiling doth adorne


heare ye foul speakers that pronounce the aire
of stewes and shores i will informe you where
and how to cloath aright your wanton wit
without her nasty bawd attending it
view here a loose thought sayd with such a grace
minerva might have spoke in venus face
so well disguisd that twas conceivd by none
but cupid had dianas linnen on
and all his naked parts so vaild th expresse
the shape with clowding the uncomlinesse
that if this reformation which we
receivd had not been buried with thee


the stage as this worke might have livd and lovd
her lines the austere skarlet had approvd
and th actors wisely been from that offence
as cleare as they are now from audience


thus with thy genius did the scaene expire
wanting thy active and correcting fire
that now to spread a darknesse over all
nothing remaines but poesie to fall
and though from these thy embers we receive
some warmth so much as may be said we live


that we dare praise thee blushlesse in the head
of the best piece hermes to love ere read
that we rejoyce and glory in thy wit
and feast each other with remembring it
that we dare speak thy thought thy acts recite
yet all men henceforth be afraid to write


lucasta fair but hapless maid
once flourisht underneath the shade
of your illustrious mother now
an orphan grown she bows to you
to you her vertues noble heir
oh may she find protection there


nor let her welcome be the less
cause a rough hand makes her address
one to whom foes the muses are
born and bred up in rugged war
for conscious how unfit i am
i only have pronouncd her name
to waken pity in your brest
and leave her tears to plead the rest


lucasta frown and let me die
but smile and see i live
the sad indifference of your eye
both kills and doth reprieve
you hide our fate within its screen
we feel our judgment ere we hear
so in one picture i have seen
an angel here the devil there


introth i do my self perswade
that the wilde boy is grown a man
and all his childishnesse off laid
ere since lucasta did his fires fan
h has left his apish jigs
and whipping hearts like gigs
for t other day i heard him swear
that beauty should be crownd in honours chair


with what a true and heavenly state
he doth his glorious darts dispence
now cleansd from falsehood blood and hate
and newly tipt with innocence
love justice is become
and doth the cruel doome
reversed is the old decree
behold he sits inthrond with majestie


inthroned in lucastas eye
he doth our faith and hearts survey
then measures them by sympathy
and each to th others breast convey
whilst to his altars now
the frozen vestals bow
and strickt diana too doth go
ahunting with his feard exchanged bow


th imbracing seas and ambient air
now in his holy fires burn
fish couple birds and beasts in pair
do their own sacrifices turn
this is a miracle
that might religion swell
but she that these and their god awes
her crowned self submits to her own laws


twas not for some calm blessing to deceive
thou didst thy polishd hands in shaggd furs weave
it were no blessing thus obtaind
thou rather wouldst a curse have gaind
then let thy warm driven snow be ever staind


not that you feared the discoloring cold
might alchymize their silver into gold
nor could your ten white nuns so sin
that you should thus pennance them in
each in her coarse hair smock of discipline


nor herolike who on their crest still wore
a lyon panther leopard or a bore
to looke their enemies in their herse
thou wouldst thy hand should deeper pierce
and in its softness rough appear more fierce


no no lucasta destiny decreed
that beasts to thee a sacrifice should bleed
and strip themselves to make you gay
for ner yet herald did display
a coat where sables upon ermin lay


this for laylovers that must stand at dore
salute the threshold and admire no more
but i in my invention tough
rate not this outward bliss enough
but still contemplate must the hidden muffe


ladies turn conjurers and can impart
the hidden mystery of the black art
black artificial patches do betray
they more affect the works of night than day
the creature strives the creator to disgrace
by patching that which is a perfect face


a little stain upon the purest dye
is both offensive to the heart and eye
defile not then with spots that face of snow
where the wise god his workmanship doth show
the light of nature and the light of grace
is the complexion for a ladys face


as i beheld a winters evening air
curld in her courtfalselocks of living hair
butterd with jessamine the sun left there


galliard and clinquant she appeard to give
a serenade or ball to us that grieve
and teach us a la mode more gently live


but as a moor who to her cheeks prefers
white spots t allure her black idolaters
me thought she lookd all orebepatchd with stars


like the dark front of some ethiopian queen
vailed all ore with gems of red blew green
whose ugly night seemd masked with days skreen


whilst the fond people offerd sacrifice
to saphyrs stead of veins and arteries
and bowd unto the diamonds not her eyes


behold lucastas face howt glows like noon
a sun intire is her complexion
and formd of one whole constellation


so gently shining so serene so cleer
her look doth universal nature cheer
only a cloud or two hangs here and there


i laugh and sing but cannot tell
whether the folly ont sounds well
but then i groan
methinks in tune
whilst grief despair and fear dance to the air
of my despised prayer


a pretty antick love does this
then strikes a galliard with a kiss
as in the end
the chords they rend
so you but with a touch from your fair hand
turn all to saraband


like to the sentnel stars i watch all night
for still the grand round of your light
and glorious breast
awake in me an east
nor will my rolling eyes ere know a west


now on my down im tossd as on a wave
and my repose is made my grave
fluttering i lye
do beat my self and dye
but for a resurrection from your eye


ah my fair murdresse dost thou cruelly heal
with various pains to make me well
then let me be
thy cut anatomie
and in each mangled part my heart youl see


i th autumn of a summers day
when all the winds got leave to play
lucasta that fair ship is lanchd
and from its crust this almond blanchd


blow then unruly northwind blow
till in their holds your eyes you stow
and swell your cheeks bequeath chill death
see she hath smild thee out of breath


court gentle zephyr court and fan
her softer breasts carnation wan
your charming rhethorick of down
flyes scatterd from before her frown


say my white waterlilly say
how ist those warm streams break away
cut by thy chast cold breast which dwells
amidst them armd in isicles


and the hot floods more raging grown
in flames of thee then in their own
in their distempers wildly glow
and kisse thy pillar of fixd snow


no sulphur through whose each blew vein
the thick and lazy currents strein
can cure the smarting nor the fell
blisters of love wherewith they swell


these great physicians of the blind
the lame and fatal blains of inde
in every drop themselves now see
speckled with a new leprosie


as sick drinks are with old wine dashd
foul waters too with spirits washd
thou greivd perchance one tear letst fall
which straight did purifie them all


and now is cleansd enough the flood
which since runs cleare as doth thy blood
of the wet pearls uncrown thy hair
and mantle thee with ermin air


lucasta hail fair conqueresse
of fire air earth and seas
thou whom all kneel to yet even thou
wilt unto love thy captive bow


forbear thou great good husband little ant
a little respite from thy flood of sweat
thou thine own horse and cart under this plant
thy spacious tent fan thy prodigious heat
down with thy double load of that one grain
it is a granarie for all thy train


cease large example of wise thrift awhile
for thy example is become our law
and teach thy frowns a seasonable smile
so cato sometimes the nakd florals saw
and thou almighty foe lay by thy sting
whilst thy unpayd musicians crickets sing


lucasta she that holy makes the day
and stills new life in fields of fueillemort
hath back restord their verdure with one ray
and with her eye bid all to play and sport
ant to work still age will thee truant call
and to save now thart worse than prodigal


austere and cynick not one hour t allow
to lose with pleasure what thou gotst with pain
but drive on sacred festivals thy plow
tearing highways with thy orecharged wain
not all thy lifetime one poor minute live
and thy orelabourd bulk with mirth relieve


look up then miserable ant and spie
thy fatal foes for breaking of their law
hovring above thee madam margaret pie
and her fierce servant meagre sir john daw
thy self and storehouse now they do store up
and thy whole harvest too within their crop


thus we unthrifty thrive within earths tomb
for some more ravnous and ambitious jaw
the grain in th ants the ant in the pies womb
the pie in th hawks the hawk ith eagles maw
so scattering to hord gainst a long day
thinking to save all we cast all away


strive not vain lover to be fine
thy silks the silkworms and not thine
you lessen to a fly your mistriss thought
to think it may be in a cobweb caught
what though her thin transparent lawn
thy heart in a strong net hath drawn
not all the arms the god of fire ere made
can the soft bulwarks of nakd love invade


be truly fine then and yourself dress
in her fair souls immaclate glass
then by reflection you may have the bliss
perhaps to see what a true fineness is
when all your gawderies will fit
those only that are poor in wit
she that a clinquant outside doth adore
dotes on a gilded statue and no more


nay prethee dear draw nigher
yet closer nigher yet
here is a double fire
a dry one and a wet
true lasting heavenly fuel
puts out the vestal jewel
when once we twining marry
mad love with wild canary


off with that crowned venice
till all the house doth flame
weel quench it straight in rhenish
or what we must not name
milk lightning still asswageth
so when our fury rageth
as th only means to cross it
weel drown it in loves posset


love never was wellwiller
unto my nag or mee
ner watterd us ith cellar
but the cheap buttery
at th head of his own barrells
where broachd are all his quarrels
should a true noble master
still make his guest his taster


see all the world howt staggers
more ugly drunk then we
as if far gone in daggers
and blood it seemd to be
we drink our glass of roses
which nought but sweets discloses
then in our loyal chamber
refresh us with loves amber


now tell me thou fair cripple
that dumb canst scarcely see
th almightinesse of tipple
and th ods twixt thee and thee
what of eliziums missing
still drinking and still kissing
adoring plump october
lord what is man and sober


now is there such a trifle
as honour the fools gyant
what is there left to rifle
when wine makes all parts plyant
let others glory follow
in their false riches wallow
and with their grief be merry
leave me but love and sherry


in the nativity of time
chloris it was not thought a crime
in direct hebrew for to woe
now wee make love as all on fire
ring retrograde our lowd desire
and court in english backward too


thrice happy was that golden age
when complement was construd rage
and fine words in the center hid
when cursed no staind no maids blisse
and all discourse was summd in yes
and nought forbad but to forbid


love then unstinted love did sip
and cherries pluckd fresh from the lip
on cheeks and roses free he fed
lasses like autumne plums did drop
and lads indifferently did drop
a flower and a maidenhead


then unconfined each did tipple
wine from the bunch milk from the nipple
paps tractable as udders were
then equally the wholsome jellies
were squeezd from olivetrees and bellies
nor suits of trespasse did they fear


a fragrant bank of strawberries
diaperd with violets eyes
was table tablecloth and fare
no palace to the clouds did swell
each humble princesse then did dwell
in the piazza of her hair


both broken faith and th cause of it
alldamning gold was damnd to th pit
their troth seald with a clasp and kisse
lasted until that extreem day
in which they smild their souls away
and in each other breathd new blisse


because no fault there was no tear
no grone did grate the granting ear
no false foul breath their delcat smell
no serpent kiss poysond the tast
each touch was naturally chast
and their mere sense a miracle


naked as their own innocence
and unembroyderd from offence
they went above poor riches gay
on softer than the cignets down
in beds they tumbled off their own
for each within the other lay


thus did they live thus did they love
repeating only joyes above
and angels were but with cloaths on
which they would put off cheerfully
to bathe them in the galaxie
then gird them with the heavenly zone


now chloris miserably crave
the offerd blisse you would not have
which evermore i must deny
whilst ravishd with these noble dreams
and crowned with mine own soft beams
injoying of my self i lye


and why an honourd ragged shirt that shows
like tatterd ensigns all its bodies blows
should it be swathed in a vest so dire
it were enough to set the child on fire
dishevelld queens should strip them of their hair
and in it mantle the new rising heir
nor do i know ought worth to wrap it in
except my parchment uppercoat of skin
and then expect no end of its chast tears
that first was rowld in down now furs of bears


but since to ladies t hath a custome been
linnen to send that travail and lye in
to the nine sempstresses my former friends
i sud but they had nought but shreds and ends
at last the jollist of the three times three
rent th apron from her smock and gave it me
twas soft and gentle subtly spun no doubt
pardon my boldnese madam heres the clout


i did believe i was in heavn
when first the heavn her self was givn
that in my heart her beams did passe
as some the sun keep in a glasse
so that her beauties thorow me
did hurt my rivalenemy
but fate alas decreed it so
that i was engine to my woe
for as a cornerd christal spot
my heart diaphanous was not
but solid stuffe where her eye flings
quick fire upon the catching strings
yet as at triumphs in the night
you see the princes arms in light
so when i once was set on flame
i burnt all ore the letters of her name


you are deceivd i sooner may dull fair
seat a dark moor in cassiopeas chair
or on the glowworms uselesse light
bestow the watching flames of night
or give the roses breath
to executed death
ere the bright hiew
of verse to you
it is just heaven on beauty stamps a fame
and we alas its triumphs but proclaim


what chains but are too light for me should i
say that lucasta in strange arms could lie
or that castara were impure
or saccarisas faith unsure
that chloris love as hair
embracd each enmies air
that all their good
ran in their blood
tis the same wrong th unworthy to inthrone
as from her proper sphere t have vertue thrown


that strange force on the ignoble hath renown
as aurum fulminans it blows vice down
twere better heavy one to crawl
forgot then raised trod on to fall
all your defections now
are not writ on your brow
odes to faults give
a shame must live
when a fat mist we view we coughing run
but that once meteor drawn all cry undone


how bright the fair paulina did appear
when hid in jewels she did seem a star
but who could soberly behold
a wicked owl in cloath of gold
or the ridiculous ape
in sacred vestas shape
so doth agree
just praise with thee
for since thy birth gave thee no beauty know
no poets pencil must or can do so


love drunk the other day knockt at my brest
but i alas was not within
my man my ear told me he came t attest
that without cause hd boxed him
and battered the windows of mine eyes
and took my heart for one ofs nunneries


i wondred at the outrage safe returnd
and stormed at the base affront
and by a friend of mine bold faith that burnd
i called him to a strict accompt
he said that by the law the challengd might
take the advantage both of arms and fight


two darts of equal length and points he sent
and nobly gave the choyce to me
which i not weighd young and indifferent
now full of nought but victorie
so we both met in one ofs mothers groves
the time at the first murmring of her doves


i stript myself naked all ore as he
for so i was best armd when bare
his first pass did my liver rase yet i
made home a falsify too neer
for when my arm to its true distance came
i nothing touchd but a fantastick flame


this this is love we daily quarrel so
an idle donquichoterie
we whip our selves with our own twisted wo
and wound the ayre for a fly
the only way t undo this enemy
is to laugh at the boy and he will cry


what so beyond all madnesse is the elf
now he hath got out of himself
his fatal enemy the bee
nor his deceivd artillerie
his shackles nor the roses bough
ner half so netled him as he is now


see ats own mother he is offering
his finger now fits any ring
old cybele he would enjoy
and now the girl and now the boy
he proffers jove a back caresse
and all his love in the antipodes


jealous of his chast psyche raging he
quarrels with student mercurie
and with a proud submissive breath
offers to change his darts with death
he strikes at the bright eye of day
and juno tumbles in her milky way


the dear sweet secrets of the gods he tells
and with loathd hate lovd heaven he swells
now like a fury he belies
myriads of pure virginities
and swears with this false frenzy hurld
theres not a vertuous she in all the world


olympus he renownces then descends
and makes a friendship with the fiends
bids charon be no more a slave
he argos riggd with stars shall have
and triple cerberus from below
must leashd t himself with him a hunting go


small type of great ones that do hum
within this whole worlds narrow room
that with a busie hollow noise
catch at the peoples vainer voice
and with spread sails play with their breath
whose very hails new christen death
poor fly caught in an airy net
thy wings have fetterd now thy feet
where like a lyon in a toyl
howere thou keepst a noble coyl


and beatst thy genrous breast that ore
the plains thy fatal buzzes rore
till thy allbellyd foe round elf
hath quarterd thee within himself


was it not better once to play
i th light of a majestick ray
where though too neer and bold the fire
might sindge thy upper down attire
and thou i th storm to loose an eye
a wing or a selftrapping thigh
yet hadst thou faln like him whose coil
made fishes in the sea to broyl
when now thast scapd the noble flame
trappd basely in a slimy frame
and free of air thou art become
slave to the spawn of mud and lome


nor ist enough thy self dos dresse
to thy swoln lord a numrous messe
and by degrees thy thin veins bleed
and piecemeal dost his poyson feed
but now devourd art like to be
a net spun for thy familie


and straight expanded in the air
hangst for thy issue too a snare
strange witty death and cruel ill
that killing thee thou thine dost kill
like pies in whose entombed ark
all fowl crowd downward to a lark
thou art thine enmies sepulcher
and in thee buriest too thine heir


yet fates a glory have reservd
for one so highly hath deservd
as the rhinoceros doth dy
under his castleenemy
as through the cranes trunk throat doth speed
the aspe doth on his feeder feed
fall yet triumphant in thy woe
bound with the entrails of thy foe


forbear this liquid fire fly
it is more fatal then the dry
that singly but embracing wounds
and this at once both burns and drowns


the salamander that in heat
and flames doth cool his monstrous sweat
whose fan a glowing cake is said
of this red furnace is afraid


viewing the rubychristal shine
thou takst it for heavenchristalline
anon thou wilt be taught to groan
tis an ascended acheron


a snowball heart in it let fall
and take it out a fireball
ali icy breast in it betrayd
breaks a destructive wild granade


tis this makes venus altars shine
this kindles frosty hymens pine
when the boy grows old in his desires
this flambeau doth new light his fires


though the cold hermit over wail
whose sighs do freeze and tears drop hail
once having passd this will ner
another flaming purging fear


the vestal drinking this doth burn
now more than in her funral urn
her fires that with the sun kept race
are now extinguishd by her face


the chymist that himself doth still
let him but tast this limbecks bill
and prove this sublimated bowl
hell swear it will calcine a soul


noble and brave now thou dost know
the false prepared decks below
dost thou the fatal liquor sup
one drop alas thy barque blowes up


what airy country hast to save
whose plagues thoult bury in thy grave
for even now thou seemst to us
on this gulphs brink a curtius


and now th art faln magnanimous fly
in where thine ocean doth fry
like the suns son who blushd the flood
to a complexion of blood


yet see my glad auricular
redeems thee though dissolvd a star
flaggy thy wings and scorchd thy thighs
thou lyst a double sacrifice


and now my warming cooling breath
shall a new life afford in death
see in the hospital of my hand
already curd thou fierce dost stand


burnt insect dost thou reaspire
the moisthotglasse and liquid fire
i see tis such a pleasing pain
thou wouldst be scorchd and drownd again


mongst the worlds wonders there doth yet remain
one greater than the rest thats all those ore again
and her own self beside a lady whose soft breast
is with vast honours soul and virtues life possest
fair as original light first from the chaos shot
when day in virginbeams triumphd and night was not
and as that breath infusd in the newbreather good
when ill unknown was dumb and bad not understood


chearful as that aspect at this worlds finishing
when cherubims clappd wings and th sons of heaven did sing
chast as th arabian bird who all the ayr denyes
and evn in flames expires when with her selfe she lyes
oh shes as kind as drops of new faln april showers
that on each gentle breast spring fresh perfuming flowers
shes constant genrous fixt shes calm she is the all
we can of vertue honour faith or glory call
and she is whom i thus transmit to endless fame
mistresse oth world and me and laura is her name


upon a day when the dogstar
unto the world proclaimd a war
and poyson barkd from black throat
and from his jaws infection shot


under a deadly henbane shade
with slime infernal mists are made
met the two dreaded enemies
having their weapons in their eyes


first from his den rolls forth that load
of spite and hate the speckld toad
and from his chaps a foam doth spawn
such as the loathed three heads yawn
defies his foe with a fell spit
to wade through death to meet with it
then in his self the lymbeck turns
and his elixird poyson urns
arachne once the fear oth maid
coelestial thus unto her prayd
heavens bleweyd daughter thine own mother
the pythonkilling suns thy brother


oh thou from gods that didst descend
with a poor virgin to contend
shall seed of earth and hell ere be
a rival in thy victorie
pallas assents for now long time
and pity had clean rinsd her crime
when straight she doth with active fire
her many legged foe inspire
have you not seen a charact lie
a great cathedral in the sea
under whose babylonian walls
a small thin frigot almshouse stalls
so in his slime the toad doth float
and th spyder by but seems his boat
and now the naumachie begins
close to the surface her self spins
arachne when her foe lets flye
a broadside of his breath too high


thats overshot the wiselystout
advised maid doth tack about
and now her pitchy barque doth sweat
chafd in her own black fury wet
lasie and cold before she brings
new fires to her contracted stings
and with discolourd spumes doth blast
the herbs that to their center hast
now to the neighbring henbane top
arachne hath her self wound up
and thence from its dilated leaves
by her own cordage downwards weaves


and doth her town of foe attack
and storms the rampiers of his back
which taken in her colours spread
march to th citadel ofs head
now as in witty torturing spain
the brain is vext to vex the brain
where hereticks bare heads are armd
in a close helm and in it charmd
an overgrown and meagre rat
that peecemeal nibbles himself fat
so on the toads blewchecquerd scull
the spider gluttons her self full
and vomiting her stygian seeds
her poyson on his poyson feeds
thus the invenomd toad now grown
big with more poyson than his own
doth gather all his powrs and shakes
his stormer ins disgorged lakes


and wounded now apace crawls on
to his next plantane surgeon
with whose rich balm no sooner drest
but purged is his sick swoln breast
and as a glorious combatant
that only rests awhile to pant
then with repeated strength and scars
that smarting fire him new to wars
deals blows that thick themselves prevent
as they would gain the time he spent


so the disdaining angry toad
that calls but a thin useless load
his fatal feared self comes back
with unknown venome filld to crack
th amased spider now untwind
hath crept up and her self new lind
with fresh salt foams and mists that blast
the ambient air as they past
and now me thinks a sphynxs wing
i pluck and do not write but sting
with their black blood my pale inks blent
galls but a faint ingredient


the poltick toad doth now withdraw
warnd higher in campania
there wisely doth intrenched deep
his body in a body keep
and leaves a wide and open pass
t invite the foe up to his jaws
which there within a foggy blind
with fourscore firearms were lind
the genrous active spider doubts
more ambuscadoes than redoubts
so within shot she doth pickear
now galls the flank and now the rear
as that the toad ins own dispite
must change the manner of his fight
who like a glorious general
with one homecharge lets fly at all
chafd with a fourfold venmous foam
of scorn revenge his foes and s own
he seats him in his loathed chair
newmade him by each mornings air


with glowing eyes he doth survey
th undaunted hoast he calls his prey
then his dark spume he gredly laps
and shows the foe his grave his chaps


whilst the quick wary amazon
of vantage takes occasion
and with her troop of leggs carreers
in a full speed with all her speers
down as some mountain on a mouse
on her small cot he flings his house
without the poyson of the elf
the toad had like t have burst himself
for sage arachne with good heed
had stopt herself upon full speed
and s body now disorderd on
she falls to execution
the passive toad now only can
contemn and suffer here began
the wronged maids ingenious rage
which his heart venome must asswage
one eye she hath spet out strange smother
when one flame doth put out another


and one eye wittily spard that he
might but behold his miserie
she on each spot a wound doth print
and each speck hath a sting withint
till he but one new blister is
and swells his own periphrasis
then fainting sick and yellowpale
she baths him with her sulphrous stale
thus slacked is her stygian fire
and she vouchsafes now to retire
anon the toad begins to pant
bethinks him of th almighty plant
and lest he peecemeal should be sped
wisely doth finish himself dead
whilst the gay girl as was her fate
doth wanton and luxuriate
and crowns her conquring head all or
with fatal leaves of hellebore


not guessing at the pretious aid
was lent her by the heavenly maid
the neer expiring toad now rowls
himself in lazy bloody scrowls
to th sovraign salve of all his ills
that only life and health distills
but loe a terror above all
that ever yet did him befall


pallas still mindful of her foe
whilst they did with each fires glow
had to the place the spiders lar
dispathd before the evnings star
he learned was in natures laws
of all her foliage knew the cause
and mongst the rest in his choice want
unplanted had this plantane plant


the allconfounded toad doth see
his life fled with his remedie
and in a glorious despair
first burst himself and next the air
then with a dismal horred yell
beats down his loathsome breath to hell


but what inestimable bliss
this to the sated virgin is
who as before of her fiend foe
now full is of her goddess too
she from her fertile womb hath spun
her stateliest pavillion
whilst all her silken flags display
and her triumphant banners play


where pallas she ith midst doth praise
and counterfeits her brothers rayes
nor will she her dear lar forget
victorious by his benefit
whose roof inchanted she doth free
from haunting gnat and goblin bee
who trappd in her prepared toyle
to their destruction keep a coyle


then she unlocks the toads dire head
within whose cell is treasured
that pretious stone which she doth call
a noble recompence for all
and to her lar doth it present
of his fair aid a monument


wise emblem of our politick world
sage snayl within thine own self curld
instruct me softly to make hast
whilst these my feet go slowly fast


compendious snayl thou seemst to me
large euclids strict epitome
and in each diagram dost fling
thee from the point unto the ring
a figure now trianglare
an oval now and now a square
and then a serpentine dost crawl
now a straight line now crookd now all


preventing rival of the day
th art up and openest thy ray
and ere the morn cradles the moon
th art broke into a beauteous noon
then when the sun sups in the deep
thy silver horns ere cinthias peep
and thou from thine own liquid bed
new phoebus heavst thy pleasant head


who shall a name for thee create
deep riddle of mysterious state
bold nature that gives common birth
to all products of seas and earth
of thee as earthquakes is afraid
nor will thy dire delivry aid


thou thine own daughter then and sire
that son and mother art intire
that big still with thy self dost go
and livst an aged embrio
that like the cubbs of india
thou from thy self a while dost play
but frighted with a dog or gun
in thine own belly thou dost run
and as thy house was thine own womb
so thine own womb concludes thy tomb


but now i must analysd king
thy oeconomick virtues sing
thou great stayd husband still within
thou thee thats thine dost discipline
and when thou art to progress bent
thou movst thy self and tenement
as warlike scythians travayld you
remove your men and city too


then after a sad dearth and rain
thou scatterest thy silver train
and when the trees grow nakd and old
thou cloathest them with cloth of gold
which from thy bowels thou dost spin
and draw from the rich mines within


now hast thou changd thee saint and made
thy self a fane thats cupulad
and in thy wreathed cloister thou
walkest thine own gray fryer too
strickt and lockd up thart hood all ore
and ner eliminatst thy dore
on sallads thou dost feed severe
and stead of beads thou dropst a tear
and when to rest each calls the bell
thou sleepst within thy marble cell
where in dark contemplation placd
the sweets of nature thou dost tast


who now with time thy days resolve
and in a jelly thee dissolve
like a shot star which doth repair
upward and rarifie the air


the centaur syren i foregoe
those have been sung and lowdly too
nor of the mixed sphynx ile write
nor the renownd hermaphrodite
behold this huddle doth appear
of horses coach and charioteer
that moveth him by traverse law
and doth himself both drive and draw
then when the sunn the south doth winne
he baits him hot in his own inne
i heard a grave and austere clark
resolvd him pilot both and barque


that like the famd ship of trevere
did on the shore himself lavere
yet the authentick do beleeve
who keep their judgement in their sleeve
that he is his own double man
and sick still carries his sedan
or that like dames ith land of luyck
he wears his everlasting huyck
but banisht i admire his fate
since neither ostracisme of state
nor a perpetual exile
can force this virtue change his soyl
for wheresoever he doth go
he wanders with his country too


sir your sad absence i complain as earth
her longhid spring that gave her verdures birth
who now her cheerful aromatick head
shrinks in her cold and dismal widowd bed
whilst the false sun her lover doth him move
below and to th antipodes make love


what fate was mine when in mine obscure cave
shut up almost close prisoner in a grave
your beams could reach me through this vault of night
and canton the dark dungeon with light
whence me as genrous spahys you unbound
whilst i now know my self both free and crownd


but as at mecchas tombe the devout blind
pilgrim great husband of his sight and mind
pays to no other object this chast prise
then with hot earth anoynts out both his eyes
so having seen your dazling glories store
it is enough and sin for to see more


or do you thus those pretious rayes withdraw
to whet my dull beams keep my bold in aw
or are you gentle and compassionate
you will not reach me regulus his fate
brave prince who eagleeyd of eagle kind
wert blindly damnd to look thine own self blind


but oh return those fires too cruelnice
for whilst you fear me cindars see im ice
a nummed speaking clod and mine own show
my self congeald a man cut out in snow


return those living fires thou who that vast
double advantage from oneeyd heavn hast
look with one sun though t but obliquely be
and if not shine vouchsafe to wink on me


perceive you not a gentle gliding heat
and quickning warmth that makes the statua sweat
as revrend ducaleons blackflung stone
whose rough outside softens to skin anon
each crusty vein with wet red is supplid
whilst nought of stone but in its heart doth bide


so from the rugged north where your soft stay
hath stampt them a meridian and kind day
where now each a la mode inhabitant
himself and s manners both do pay you rent
and bout your house your pallace doth resort
and spite of fate and war creates a court


so from the taught north when you shall return
to glad those looks that ever since did mourn
when men uncloathed of themselves youl see
then start new made fit what they ought to be
hast hast you that your eyes on rare sights feed
for thus the golden triumph is decreed


the twiceborn god still gay and ever young
with ivie crownd first leads the glorious throng
he ariadnes starry coronet
designs for th brighter beams of amoret
then doth he broach his throne and singing quaff
unto her health his pipe of godhead off


him follow the recanting vexing nine
who wise now sing thy lasting fame in wine
whilst phoebus not from th east your feast t adorn
but from th inspird canaries rose this morn


now you are come winds in their caverns sit
and nothing breaths but newinlarged wit
hark one proclaims it piacle to be sad
and th people call t religion to be mad


but now as at a coronation
when noyse the guard and trumpets are oreblown
the silent commons mark their princes way
and with still reverence both look and pray
so they amazd expecting do adore
and count the rest but pageantry before


behold an hoast of virgins pure as th air
in her first face ere mists durst vayl her hair
their snowy vests white as their whiter skin
or their far chaster whiter thoughts within
roses they breathd and strewd as if the fine
heaven did to earth his wreath of swets resign
they sang aloud thrice oh thrice happy they
that can like these in love both yield and sway


next herald fame a purple clowd her bears
in an imbroiderd coat of eyes and ears
proclaims the triumph and these lovers glory
then in a book of steel records the story


and now a youth of more than godlike form
did th inward minds of the dumb throng alarm
all nakd each part betrayd unto the eye
chastly for neither sex owd he or she
and this was heavnly love by his bright hand
a boy of worse than earthly stuff did stand
his bow broke his fires out and his wings clipt
and the black slave from all his false flames stript


whose eyes were newrestord but to confesse
this days bright blisse and his own wretchednesse
who swelld with envy bursting with disdain
did cry to cry and weep them out again


and now what heavn must i invade what sphere
rifle of all her stars t inthrone her there
no phoebus by thy boys fate we beware
th unruly flames oth firebrand thy carr
although she there once placd thou sun shouldst see
thy day both nobler governed and thee
drive on bootes thy cold heavy wayn
then grease thy wheels with amber in the main
and neptune thou to thy false thetis gallop
appollos set within thy bed of scallop


whilst amoret on the reconciled winds
mounted and drawn by six caelestial minds
she armed was with innocence and fire
that did not burn for it was chast desire
whilst a new light doth gild the standers by
behold it was a day shot from her eye
chafing perfumes oth east did throng and sweat
but by her breath they melting back were beat


a crown of yetnerelighted stars she wore
in her soft hand a bleeding heart she bore


then a wingd crier thrice aloud did call
let fame proclaim this one great prise for all


by her a lady that might be calld fair
and justly but that amoret was there
was prisner led th unvalewed robe she wore
made infinite lay lovers to adore
who vainly tempt her rescue madly bold
chained in sixteen thousand links of gold
chrysetta thus loaden with treasures slave
did strow the pass with pearls and her way pave


but loe the glorious cause of all this high
true heavnly state brave philamore draws nigh
who not himself more seems himself to be
and with a sacred extasie doth see
fixd and unmovd on s pillars he doth stay
and joy transforms him his own statua
nor hath he powr to breath nor strength to greet
the gentle offers of his amoret
who now amazd at s noble breast doth knock
and with a kiss his genrous heart unlock
whilst she and the whole pomp doth enter there
whence her nor time nor fate shall ever tear
but whether am i hurld ho back awake
from thy glad trance to thine old sorrow take


thus after view of all the indies store
the slave returns unto his chain and oar
thus poets who all night in blest heavns dwell
are calld next morn to their true living hell
so i unthrifty to myself untrue
rise cloathd with real wants cause wanting you
and what substantial riches i possesse
i must to these unvalued dreams confesse


but all our clowds shall be oreblown when thee
in our horizon bright once more we see
when thy dear presence shall our souls newdress
and spring an universal cheerfulnesse
when we shall be orewhelmd in joy like they
that change their night for a vast halfyears day


then shall the wretched few that do repine
see and recant their blasphemies in wine
then shall they grieve that thought ive sung too free
high and aloud of thy true worth and thee
and their fowl heresies and lips submit
to th allforgiving breath of amoret


and me alone their angers object call
that from my height so miserably did fall
and crie out my invention thin and poor
who have said nought since i could say no more


frank wilt live unhandsomely trust not too far
thy self to waving seas for what thy star
calculated by sure event must be
look in the glassyepithete and see


yet settle here your rest and take your state
and in calm halcyons nest evn build your fate
prethee lye down securely frank and keep
with as much no noyse the inconstant deep
as its inhabitants nay stedfast stand
as if discoverd were a newfoundland
fit for plantation here dream dream still
lulld in diones cradle dream untill
horrour awake your sense and you now find
your self a bubbled pastime for the wind
and in loose thetis blankets torn and tost
frank to undo thy self why art at cost


nor be too confident fixd on the shore
for even that too borrows from the store
of her rich neighbour since now wisest know
and this to galileos judgement ow
the palsie earth it self is every jot
as frail inconstant waveing as that blot


we lay upon the deep that sometimes lies
changd you would think with s botoms properties
but this eternal strange ixions wheel
of giddy earth neer whirling leaves to reel
till all things are inverted till they are
turnd to that antick confusd state they were


who loves the golden mean doth safely want
a cobwebbd cot and wrongs entaild upont
he richly needs a pallace for to breed
vipers and moths that on their feeder feed
the toy that we too true a mistress call
whose lookingglass and feather weighs up all
and cloaths which larks would play with in the sun
that mock him in the night when s course is run


to rear an edifice by art so high
that envy should not reach it with her eye
nay with a thought come neer it wouldst thou know
how such a structure should be raisd build low
the blustring winds invisible rough stroak
more often shakes the stubbornst proprest oak
and in proud turrets we behold withal
tis the imperial top declines to fall
nor does heavns lightning strike the humble vales
but highaspiring mounts batters and scales


a breast of proof defies all shocks of fate
fears in the best hopes in worser state
heaven forbid that as of old time ever
flourishd in spring so contrary now never
that mighty breath which blew foul winter hither
can easly puffe it to a fairer weather
why dost despair then frank aeolus has
a zephyrus as well as boreas


tis a false sequel soloecisme gainst those
precepts by fortune givn us to suppose
that cause it is now ill t will ere be so
apollo doth not always bend his bow
but oft uncrowned of his beams divine
with his soft harp awakes the sleeping nine


in strictest things magnanimous appear
greater in hope howere thy fate then fear
draw all your sails in quickly though no storm
threaten your ruine with a sad alarm
for tell me how they differ tell me pray
a cloudy tempest and a too fair day


behold three sisterwonders in whom met
distinct and chast the splendrous counterfeit
of juno venus and the warlike maid
each in their three divinities arrayd
the majesty and state of heavns great queen
and when she treats the gods her noble meen
the sweet victorious beauties and desires
o th seaborn princess empresse too of fires
the sacred arts and glorious lawrels torn
from the fair brow o th goddesse fatherborn
all these were quarterd in each snowy coat
with cantond honours of their own to boot
paris by fate newwakd from his dead cell
is chargd to give his doom impossible
he views in each the bravry of all ide
whilst one as once three doth his soul divide
then sighs so equally theyre glorious all
what pity the whole world is but one ball


if pliny lord high treasurer of all
natures exchequer shuffled in this our ball
peinture her richer rival did admire
and cryd she wrought with more almighty fire
that judgd the unnumberd issue of her scrowl
infinite and various as her mother soul
that contemplation into matter brought
bodyd ideas and could form a thought
why do i pause to couch the cataract
and the grosse pearls from our dull eyes abstract
that powrful lilly now awakend we
this new creation may behold by thee


to thy victorious pencil all that eyes
and minds call reach do bow the deities
bold poets first but feignd you do and make
and from your awe they our devotion take
your beauteous pallet first defind loves queen
and made her in her heavnly colours seen
you strung the bow of the bandite her son
and tippd his arrowes with religion
neptune as unknown as his fish might dwell
but that you seat him in his throne of shell


the thunderers artillery and brand
you fancied rome in his fantastick hand
and the pale frights the pains and fears of hell
first from your sullen melancholy fell
who cleft th infernal dogs loathd head in three
and spun out hydras fifty necks by thee
as prepossessd w enjoy th elizian plain
which but before was flatterd in our brain
who ere yet viewd airs child invisible
a hollow voice but in thy subtile skill
faint stammring eccho you so draw that we
the very repercussion do see
cheathocuspocusnature an assay
o th spring affords us praesto and away
you all the year do chain her and her fruits
roots to their beds and flowers to their roots
have not mine eyes feasted i th frozen zone
upon a fresh newgrown collation
of apples unknown sweets that seemd to me
hanging to tempt as on the fatal tree
so delicately limnd i vowd to try
my appetite imposd upon my eye
you sir alone fame and allconquring rime
file the set teeth of alldevouring time


when beauty once thy vertuous paint hath on
age needs not call her to vermilion
her beams nere shed or change like th hair of day
she scatters fresh her everlasting ray
nay from her ashes her fair virgin fire
ascends that doth new massacres conspire
whilst we wipe off the numrous score of years
and do behold our grandsires as our peers
with the first father of our house compare
we do the features of our newborn heir
for though each coppied a son they all
meet in thy first and true original
sacred luxurious what princesse not
but comes to you to have her self begot
as when first man was kneaded from his side
is born tos hand a readymadeup bride
he husband to his issue then doth play
and for more wives remove the obstructed way
so by your art you spring up in two noons
what could not else be formd by fifteen suns
thy skill doth anmate the prolifick flood
and thy red oyl assimilates to blood
where then when all the world pays its respect
lies our transalpine barbarous neglect
when the chast hands of powrful titian
had drawn the scourges of our god and man
and now the top of th altar did ascend
to crown the heavnly piece with a bright end
whilst he who in seven languages gave law
and always like the sun his subjects saw
did in his robes imperial and gold
the basis of the doubtful ladder hold
o charls a nobler monument than that
which thou thine own executor wert at
when to our huffling henry there complaind
a grieved earl that thought his honor staind


away frownd he for your own safeties hast
in one cheap hour ten coronets il cast
but holbeens noble and prodigious worth
onely the pangs of an whole age brings forth
henry a word so princely saving said
it might new raise the ruines thou hast made
o sacred peincture that dost fairly draw
what but in mists deep inward poets saw
twixt thee and an intelligence no odds
that art of privy council to the gods
by thee unto our eyes they do prefer
a stamp of their abstracted character
thou that in frames eternity dost bind
and art a written and a bodyd mind
to thee is ope the juncto o th abysse
and its conspiracy detected is
whilest their cabal thou to our sense dost show
and in thy square paintst what they threat below
now my best lilly lets walk hand in hand
and smile at this ununderstanding land
let them their own dull counterfeits adore
their rainbowcloaths admire and no more
within one shade of thine more substance is
than all their varnishd idolmistresses
whilst great vasari and vermander shall
interpret the deep mystery of all


and i unto our modern picts shall show
what due renown to thy fair art they owe
in the delineated lives of those
by whom this everlasting lawrel grows
then if they will not gently apprehend
let one great blot give to their fame an end
whilst no poetick flower their herse doth dresse
but perish they and their effigies


the day is curld about agen
to view the splendor she was in
when first with hallowd hands
the holy man knit the mysterious bands


when you two your contracted souls did move
like cherubims above


as your ununderstanding issue now
in a glad sigh a smile a tear a vow


tell me o selfreviving sun
in thy perigrination
hast thou beheld a pair
twist their soft beams like these in their chast air
as from bright numberlesse imbracing rayes
are sprung th industrious dayes
so when they gaze
and change their fertile eyes with the new morn
a beauteous offspring is shot forth not born


be witness then allseeing sun
old spy thou that thy race hast run
in full five thousand rings
to thee were ever purer offerings
sent on the wings of faith and thou o night
curtain of their delight
by these made bright
have you not markd their coelestial play
and no more peekd the gayeties of day


come then pale virgins roses strow
mingled with ios as you go
the snowy ox is killd
the fane with proslyte lads and lasses filld
you too may hope the same seraphic joy
old time cannot destroy
nor fulnesse cloy
when like these you shall stamp by sympathies
thousands of newbornloves with your chaste eyes


twas a blith prince exchangd five hundred crowns
for a fair turnip dig dig on o clowns
but how this comes about fates can you tell
this more then maid of meurs this miracle
let me not live if i think not st mark
has all the oar as well as beasts ins ark
no wonder tis he marries the rich sea
but to betroth him to nakd poesie
and with a bankrupt muse to merchandise
his treasures beams sure have put out his eyes
his conquest at lepanto il let pass
when the sick sea with turbants nightcapd was
and now at candie his full courage shown
that wand to a wan line the halfhalf moon
this is a wreath this is a victorie
caesar himself would have lookd pale to see
and in the height of all his triumphs feel
himself but chaind to such a mighty wheel


and now me thinks we ape augustus state
so ugly we his high worth imitate
monkey his godlike glories so that we
keep light and form with such deformitie
as i have seen an arrogant baboon
with a small piece of glasse zany the sun
rome to her bard who did her battails sing
indifferent gave to poet and to king
with the same lawrells were his temples fraught
who best had written and who best had fought
the self same fame they equally did feel
ones style adord as much as t others steel
a chain or fasces she could then afford
the sons of phoebus we an axe or cord
sometimes a coronet was her renown
and ours the dear prerogative of a crown
in marble statud walks great lucan lay
and now we walk our own pale statua
they the whole year with roses crownd would dine
and we in all december know no wine
disciplind dieted sure there hath bin
ods twixt a poet and a capuchin


of princes women wine to sing i see
is no apocrypha for to rise high
commend this olio of this lord tis fit
nay ten to one but you have part of it
there is that justice left since you maintain
his table he should counterfeed your brain
then write how well he in his sack hath drolld
straight theres a bottle to your chamber rolld
or with embroiderd words praise his french suit
month hence tis yours with his mans to boot
or but applaud his bossd legs two to none
but he most nobly doth give you one
or spin an elegie on his false hair
tis well he cries but living hair is dear
yet say that out of order thers one curl
and all the hopes of your reward you furl
write a deep epick poem and you may
as soon delight them as the opera
where they diogenes thought in his tub
never so sowre did look so sweet a club
you that do suck for thirst your black quils blood
and chaw your labourd papers for your food
i will inform you how and what to praise
then skin y in satin as young lovelace plaies
beware as you would your fierce guests your lice
to strip the cloath of gold from cherishd vice


rather stand off with awe and reverend fear
hang a poetick pendant in her ear
court her as her adorers do their glasse
though that as much of a true substance has
whilst all the gall from your wild ink you drain
the beauteous sweets of vertues cheeks to stain
and in your livery let her be known
as poor and tatterd as in her own
nor write nor speak you more of sacred writ
but what shall force up your arrested wit
be chast religion and her priests your scorn
whilst the vain fanes of idiots you adorn
it is a mortal errour you must know
of any to speak good if he be so
rayl till your edged breath flea your raw throat
and burn remarks on all of genrous note
each verse be an indictment be not free
sanctity t self from thy scurrility
libel your father and your dam buffoon
the noblest matrons of the isle lampoon
whilst aretine and s bodies you dispute
and in your sheets your sister prostitute
yet there belongs a sweetnesse softnesse too
which you must pay but first pray know to who
there is a creature if i may so call
that unto which they do all prostrate fall
termd mistress when theyr angry but pleasd high
it is a princesse saint divinity
to this they sacrifice the whole days light
then lye with their devotion all night
for this you are to dive to the abysse
and rob for pearl the closet of some fish


arabia and sabaea you must strip
of all their sweets for to supply her lip
and steal new fire from heavn for to repair
her unfledgd scalp with berenices hair


as now youre in your coach save you bright sir
o spare your thanks is not this finer far
then walk unhided when that every stone
has knockd acquaintance with your anklebone


when your wingd papers like the last dove nere
returnd to quit you of your hope or fear
but left you to the mercy of your host
and your days fare a fortified toast
how many battels sung in epick strain
would have procurd your head thatch from the rain
not all the arms of thebes and troy would get
one knife but to anatomize your meat
a funeral elegie with a sad boon
might make you hei sip wine like maccaroon


but if perchance there did a riband come
not the trainband so fierce with all its drum
yet with your torch you homeward would retire
and heartly wish your bed your funral pyre
with what a fury have i known you feed
upon a contract and the hopes t might speed
not the fair bride impatient of delay
doth wish like you the beauties of that day
hotter than all the roasted cooks you sat
to dresse the fricace of your alphabet
which sometimes would be drawn dough anagrame
sometimes acrostick parched in the flame
then posies stewd with sippets mottos by
of minced verse a miserable pye
how many knots slipd ere you twist their name
with th old device as both their hearts the same
whilst like to drills the feast in your false jaw
you would transmit at leisure to your maw
then after all your fooling fat and wine
gluttond at last return at home to pine
tell me o sun since first your beams did play
to night and did awake the sleeping day
since first your steeds of light their race did start
did you ere blush as now oh thou that art
the common father to the base pissmire
as well as great alcides did the fire
from thine owne altar which the gods adore
kindle the souls of gnats and wasps before
who would delight in his chast eyes to see
dormise to strike at lights of poesie
faction and envy now are downright rage
once a fiveknotted whip there was the stage


the beadle and the executioner
to whip small errors and the great ones tear
now as ere nimrod the first king he writes
thats strongest th ablest deepest bites
the muses weeping fly their hill to see
their noblest sons of peace in mutinie
could there nought else this civil war compleat
but poets raging with poetic heat
tearing themselves and th endlesse wreath as though
immortal they their wrath should be so too
and doubly fird apollo burns to see
in silent helicon a naumachie
parnassus hears these at his first alarms
never till now minerva was in arms
o more then conquror of the world great rome
thy heros did with gentleness ore come
thy foes themselves but one another first
whilst envy stript alone was left and burst
the learnd decemviri tis true did strive
but to add flames to keep their fame alive
whilst the eternal lawrel hung ith air
nor of these ten sons was there found one heir
like to the golden tripod it did pass
from this to this till t came to him whose twas
caesar to gallus trundled it and he
to maro maro naso unto thee
naso to his tibullus flung the wreath
he to catullus thus did bequeath
this glorious circle to another round
at last the temples of their god it bound
i might believe at least that each might have
a quiet fame contented in his grave


envy the living not the dead doth bite
for after death all men receave their right
if it be sacriledge for to profane
their holy ashes what ist then their flame
he does that wrong unweeting or in ire
as if one should put out the vestal fire
let earths four quarters speak and thou sun bear
now witnesse for thy fellowtraveller
i was allyd dear uncle unto thee
in blood but thou alas not unto me
your vertues powrs and mine differd at best
as they whose springs you saw the east and west
let me awhile be twisted in thy shine
and pay my due devotions at thy shrine
might learned waynman rise who went with thee
in thy heavns work beside divinity
i should sit still or mighty falkland stand
to justifie with breath his powrful hand
the glory that doth circle your pale urn
might hallowd still and undefiled burn
but i forbear flames that are wildly thrown
at sacred heads curle back upon their own
sleep heavenly sands whilst what they do or write
is to give god himself and you your right
there is not in my mind one sullen fate
of old but is concentred in our state
vandall orerunners goths in literature
ploughmen that would parnassus newmanure
ringers of verse that allinchime
and toll the changes upon every rime
a mercer now by th yard does measure ore
an ode which was but by the foot before
deals you an ell of epigram and swears
it is the strongest and the finest wears


no wonder if a drawer verses rack
if tis not his t may be the spirt of sack
whilst the fair barmaid stroaks the muses teat
for milk to make the posset up compleat
arise thou revrend shade great johnson rise
break through thy marble natural disguise
behold a mist of insects whose meer breath
will melt thy hallowd leaden house of death
what was crispinus that you should defie
the age for him he durst not look so high
as your immortal rod he still did stand
honourd and held his forehead to thy brand
these scorpions with which we have to do
are fiends not only small but deadly too
well mightst thou rive thy quill up to the back
and scrue thy lyres grave chords untill they crack
for though once hell resented musick these
divels will not but are in worse disease
how would thy mascline spirit father ben
sweat to behold basely deposed men
justled from the prerogtive of their bed
whilst wives are perwigd with their husbands head
each snatches the male quill from his faint hand
and must both nobler write and understand
he to her fury the soft plume doth bow
o pen nere truely justly slit till now
now as her self a poem she doth dresse
and curls a line as she would do a tresse
powders a sonnet as she does her hair
then prostitutes them both to publick aire
nor is t enough that they their faces blind
with a false dye but they must paint their mind


in meeter scold and in scannd order brawl
yet theres one sapho left may save them all
but now let me recal my passion
oh from a noble father nobler son
you that alone are the clarissimi
and the whole genrous state of venice be
it shall not be recorded sanazar
shall boast inthrond alone this new made star
you whose correcting sweetnesse hath forbad
shame to the good and glory to the bad
whose honour hath evn into vertue tamd
these swarms that now so angerly i namd
forgive what thus distemperd i indite
for it is hard a satyre not to write
yet as a virgin that heats all her blood
at the first motion of bad understood
then at meer thought of fair chastity
straight cools again the tempests of her sea
so when to you i my devotions raise
all wrath and storms do end in calm and praise


cleft as the top of the inspired hill
struggles the soul of my divided quill
whilst this foot doth the watry mount aspire
that sinais living and enlivening fire
behold my powers stormd by a twisted light
o th sun and his first kindled his sight
and my lost thoughts invoke the prince of day
my right to th spring of it and him do pray


say happy youth crownd with a heavnly ray
of the first flame and interwreathed bay
inform my soul in labour to begin
ios or anthems poeans or a hymne
shall i a hecatombe on thy tripod slay
or my devotions at thy altar pay
while which t adore th amazd world cannot tell
the sublime urim or deep oracle


heark how the moving chords temper our brain
as when apollo serenades the main
old ocean smooths his sullen furrowd front
and nereids do glide soft measures ont
whilst th air puts on its sleekest smoothest face
and each doth turn the others lookingglasse
so by the sinewy lyre now strook we see
into soft calms all storm of poesie
and former thundering and lightning lines
and verse now in its native lustre shines


how wert thou hid within thyself how shut
thy pretious iliads lockd up in a nut
not hearing of thee thou dost break out strong
invading forty thousand men in song
and we secure in our thin empty heat
now find ourselves at once surprised and beat
whilst the most valiant of our wits now sue
fling down their arms ask quarter too of you


so cabind up in its disguisd coarse rust
and scurfd all ore with its unseemly crust
the diamond from midst the humbler stones
sparkling shoots forth the price of nations
ye safe unriddlers of the stars pray tell
by what name shall i stamp my miracle
thou strange inverted aeson that leapst ore
from thy first infancy into fourscore


that to thine own self hast the midwife playd
and from thy brain springst forth the heavnly maid
thou staffe of him bore him that bore our sins
which but set down to bloom and bear begins
thou rod of aaron with one motion hurld
budst a perfume of flowers through the world
you strange calcined seeds within a glass
each species idaea springst as twas
bright vestal flame that kindled but evn now
for ever dost thy sacred fires throw


thus the repeated acts of nestors age
that now had three times ore outlivd the stage
and all those beams contracted into one
alcides in his cradle hath outdone


but all these flourshing hiews with which i die
thy virgin paper now are vain as i
for bove the poets heavn th art taught to shine
and move as in thy proper crystalline
whence that molehill parnassus thou dost view
and us small ants there dabbling in its dew
whence thy seraphic soul such hymns doth play
as those to which first danced the first day


where with a thorn from the worldransoming wreath
thou stung dost antiphons and anthems breathe
where with an angels quil dipd i th lambs blood
thou singst our pelicans allsaving flood
and bathst thy thoughts in everliving streams
renchd from earths tainted fat and heavy steams
there move translated youth inrolld i th quire
that only doth with wholy lays inspire
to whom his burning coach eliah sent
and th royal prophetpriest his harp hath lent
which thou dost tune in consort unto those
clap wings for ever at each hallowd close
whilst we now weak and fainting in our praise
sick echo ore thy halleluiahs


im unoreclowded too free from the mist
the blind and late heavenseyes great occulist
obscured with the false fires of his sceme
not half those souls are lightned by this theme


unhappy murmurers that still repine
after th eclipse our sun doth brighter shine
recant your false grief and your true joys know
your blisse is endlesse as you feard your woe
what fortnate flood is this what storm of wit
oh who would live and not orewhelmd in it


no more a fatal deluge shall be hurld
this inundation hath savd the world
once more the mighty fletcher doth arise
roabd in a vest studded with stars and eyes
of all his former glories his last worth
imbroiderd with what yet light ere brought forth
see in this glad farewel he doth appear
stuck with the constellations of his sphere


fearing we numbd feard no flagration
hath curld all his fires in this one one
which as they guard his hallowed chast urn
the dull aproaching hereticks do burn


fletcher at his adieu carouses thus
to the luxurious ingenious
as cleopatra did of old outvie
th unnumbred dishes of her anthony
when he at th empty board a wonderer
smiling she calls for pearl and vinegar
first pledges him ins breath then at one draught
swallows three kingdoms of to his best thought


hear oh ye valiant writers and subscribe
his force set by yare conquerd by this bribe
though you hold out your selves he doth commit
in this a sacred treason in your wit
although in poems desperately stout
give up this overture must buy you out


thus with some prodigal usrer t doth fare
that keeps his gold still vayld his steelbreast bare
that doth exceed his coffers all buts eye
and his eyes idol the wingd deity
that cannot lock his mines with half the art
as some rich beauty doth his wretched heart
wild at his real poverty and so wise
to win her turns himself into a prise
first startles her with th emerald madlover
the ruby arcas least she should recover
her dazled thought a diamond he throws
splendid in all the bright aspatias woes
then to sum up the abstract of his store
he flings a rope of pearl of forty more
ah see the staggring virtue faints which he
beholding darts his wealths epitome
and now to consummate her wished fall
shows this one carbuncle that darkens all


what means this stately tablature
the ballance of thy streins
which seems in stead of sifting pure
t extend and rack thy veins
thy odes first their own harmony did break
for singing troth is but in tune to speak


nor trus thy golden feet and wings
it may be thought false melody
t ascend to heavn by silver strings
this is uranias heraldry
thy royal poem now we may extol
as truly luna blazond upon sol


as when amphion first did call
each listning stone froms den
and with his lute did form the wall
but with his words the men
so in your twisted numbers now you thus
not only stocks perswade but ravish us


thus do your ayrs eccho ore
the notes and anthems of the sphaeres
and their whole consort back restore
as if earth too would blesse heavns ears
but yet the spoaks by which they scald so high
gamble hath wisely laid of ut re mi


sir how unravelld is the golden fleece
men that could only fool at fox and geese
are newmade polititians by thy book
and both can judge and conquer with a look
the hidden fate of princes you unfold
court clergy commons by your law controld
strange serious wantoning all that they
blusterd and clutterd for you play


tis not from cheap thanks thinly to repay
th immortal grove of thy fairorderd bay
thou plantedst round my humble fane that i
stick on thy hearse this sprig of elegie
nor that your soul so fast was linkd in me
that now ive both sincet has forsaken thee
that thus i stand a swisse before thy gate
and dare for such another time and fate
alas our faiths made different essays
our minds and merits brake two several ways
justice commands i wake thy learned dust
and truth in whom all causes center must


behold when but a youth thou fierce didst whip
upright the crooked age and gilt vice strip
a senator praetext that knewst to sway
the fasces yet under the ferula
rankd with the sage ere blossome did thy chin
sleeked without and hair all ore within
who in the school couldst argue as in schools
thy lessons were evn academie rules
so that fair cam saw thee matriculate
at once a tyro and a graduate


at nineteen what essayes have we beheld
that well might have the book of dogmas swelld
tough paradoxes such as tullys thou
didst heat thee with when snowy was thy brow
when thy undownd face movd the nine to shake
and of the muses did a decad make
what shall i say by what allusion bold
none but the sun was ere so young and old


young reverend shade ascend awhile whilst we
now celebrate this posthume victorie
this victory that doth contract in death
evn all the powrs and labours of thy breath
like the judean hero in thy fall
thou pullst the house of learning on us all
and as that soldier conquest doubted not
who but one splinter had of castriot


but would assault evn death so strongly charmd
and naked oppose rocks with his bone armd
so we secure in this fair relique stand
the slings and darts shot by each profane hand
these soveraign leaves thou leftst us are become
sear clothes against all times infection


sacred hierocles whose heavnly thought
first acted ore this comment ere it wrote
thou hast so spirited elixird we
conceive there is a noble alchymie
thats turning of this gold to something more
pretious than gold we never knew before
who now shall doubt the metempsychosis
of the great author that shall peruse this
let others dream thy shadow wandering strays
in th elizian mazes hid with bays
or that snatcht up in th upper region
tis kindled there a constellation
i have informd me and declare with ease
thy soul is fled into hierocles


to pay my love to thee and pay it so
as honest men should what they justly owe
were to write better of thy life then can
the assuredst pen of the most worthy man
such was thy composition such thy mind
improvd from vertue and from vice refind
thy youth an abstract of the worlds best parts
invrd to arms and exercisd to arts
which with the vigour of a man became
thine and thy countries piramids of fame
two glorious lights to guide our hopeful youth
into the paths of honour and of truth
these parts so rarely met made up in thee
what man should in his full perfection be


so sweet a temper into every sence
and each affection breathd an influence
as smoothd them to a calme which still withstood
the ruffling passions of untamed blood
without a wrinckle in thy face to show
thy stable breast could a disturbance know
in fortune humble constant in mischance
expert in both and both servd to advance
thy name by various trialls of thy spirit
and give the testimony of thy merit
valiant to envy of the bravest men
and learned to an undisputed pen
good as the best in both and great but yet
no dangerous courage nor offensive wit
these ever servd the one for to defend
the other nobly to advance thy friend


under which title i have found my name
fixd in the living chronicle of fame
to times succeeding yet i hence must go
displeasd i cannot celebrate thee so
but what respect acknowledgement and love
what these together when improvd improve
call it by any name so it express
ought like a tribute to thy worthyness
and may my bounden gratitude become
lovelace i offer at thy honourd tomb
and though thy vertues many friends have bred
to love thee liveing and lament thee dead
in characters far better couchd then these
mine will not blott thy fame nor theirs encrease
twas by thine own great merits raisd so high
that maugre time and fate it shall not dye


the rose and other fragrant flowers smell best
when they are pluckd and worn in hand or brest
so this fair flowr of vertue this rare bud
of wit smells now as fresh as when he stood
and in these posthumepoems lets us know
he on the banks of helicon did grow
the beauty of his soul did correspond
with his sweet outside nay it went beyond


lovelace the minion of the thespian dames
apollos darling born with enthean flames
which in his numbers wave and shine so clear
as sparks refracted from rich gemmes appear
such flames that may inspire and atoms cast
to make new poets not like him in hast


pardon blest shade that i thus crowd to be
mong those that sin unto thy memory
and that i think unvalud reliques spread
and am the first that pillages the dead
since who would be thy mourner as befits
but an officious sacriledge commits
how my tears strive to do thee fairer right
and from the characters divide my sight
untill it dimmer a new torrent swells
and what obscurd it falls my spectacles


as they would not be wept but weep the eyes
but the weak bubbles of mortalitie


until our griefs are drawn up by the sun
and that too drop the exhalation
how in thy dust we humble now our pride
and bring thee a whole people mortifid
for who expects not death now thou art gone
shows his low folly not religion
can the poetick heaven still hold on
the golden dance when the first movers gon


and the snatchd fires which circularly hurld
in their strong rapture glimmer to the world
and not stupendiously rather rise
the tapers unto these solemnities
can the chords move in tune when thou dost dye
at once their universal harmony
but where apollos harp with murmur laid
had to the stones a melody conveyd


they by some pebble summond would reply
in loud results to every battery
thus do we come unto thy marble room
to eccho from the musick of thy tombe
may we dare speak thee dead that wouldest be
in thy remove only not such as we
no wonder the advance is from us hid
earth could not lift thee higher then it did
and thou that didst grow up so ever nigh
art but now gone to immortality
so near to where thou art thou here didst dwell
the change to thee is less perceptible


thy but unablycomprehending clay
to what could not be circumscribd gave way
and the more spacious tennant to return
crackd in the two restraind estate its urn
that is but left to a successive trust
the souls first buried in his bodies dust
thou more thy self now thou art less confind
art not concernd in what is left behind
while we sustain the losse that thou art gone
unessencd in the separation
and he that weeps thy funerall in one
is pious to the widdowd nation
and under what now covert must i sing
secure as if beneath a cherubs wing
when thou hast tane thy flight hence and art nigh
in place to some related hierarchie
where a bright wreath of glories doth but set
upon thy head an equal coronet
and thou above our humble converse gon
canst but be reachd by contemplation
our lutes as thine was touchd were vocall by
and thence receivd the soul by sympathy
that did above the threds inspiring creep
and with soft whispers broke the amrous sleep
which now no more movd with the sweet surprise
awake into delicious rapsodies


but with their silent mistress do comply
and fast in undisturbed slumbers lye
how from thy first ascent thou didst disperse
a blushing warmth throughout the universe
while near the morns lucastas fires did glow
and to the earth a purer dawn did throw
we ever saw thee in the roll of fame
advancing thy already deathless name
and though it could but be above its fate
thou wouldst however supererrogate
now as in venice when the wanton state
before a spaniard spread their crowded plate
he made it the sage business of his eye
to find the root of the wild treasury
so learnt from that exchequer but the more
to rate his masters vegetable ore


thus when the greek and latin muse we read
as but the cold inscriptions of the dead
we to advantage then admired thee
who didst live on still with thy poesie
and in our proud enjoyments never knew
the end of the unruly wealth that grew
but now we have the last dear ingots gaind
and the free vein however rich is dreind
though what thou hast bequeathed us no space
of this worlds span of time shall ere embrace
but as who sometimes knew not to conclude
upon the waters strange vicissitude
did to the ocean himself commit
that it might comprehend what could not it
so we in our endeavours must outdone
be swallowed up within thy helicon
thou who art layd up in thy precious cave
and from the hollow spaces of thy grave


we still may mourn in tune but must alone
hereafter hope to quaver out a grone
no more the chirping sonnets with shrill notes
must henceforth volley from our treble throtes
but each sad accent must be humourd well
to the deep solemn organ of thy cell
why should some rude hand carve thy sacred stone
and there incise a cheap inscription
when we can shed the tribute of our tears
so long till the relenting marble wears
which shall such order in their cadence keep
that they a native epitaph shall weep
untill each letter spelt distinctly lyes
cut by the mystick droppings of our eyes


me thinks when kings prophets and poets dye
we should not bid men weep nor ask them why
but the great loss should by instinct impair
the nations like a pestilential ayr
and in a moment men should feel the cramp
of grief like persons poysond with a damp
all things in nature should their death deplore
and the sun look less lovely than before
the fixed stars should change their constant spaces
and comets cast abroad their flagrant faces
yet still we see princes and poets fall
without their proper pomp of funerall
men look about as if they nere had known
the poets lawrell or the princes crown


lovelace hath long been dead and he can be
obligd to no man for an elegie
are you all turnd to silence or did he
retain the only sap of poesie
that kept all branches living must his fall
set an eternal period upon all
so when a springtide doth begin to fly
from the green shoar each neighbouring creek grows dry
but why do i so pettishly detract
an age that is so perfect so exact
in all things excellent it is a fame
or glory to deceased lovelace name
for he is weak in wit who doth deprave
anothers worth to make his own seem brave


and this was not his aim nor is it mine
i now conceive the scope of their designe
which is with one consent to bring and burn
contributary incence on his urn
where each mans love and fancy shall be tryd
as when great johnson or brave shakespear dyed
wits must unite for ignorance we see
hath got a great train of artillerie
yet neither shall nor can it blast the fame
and honour of deceased lovelace name
whose own lucasta can support his credit
amongst all such who knowingly have read it
but who that praise can by desert discusse
due to those poems that are posthumous


and if the last conceptions are the best
those by degrees do much transcend the rest
so full so fluent that they richly sute
with orpheus lire or with anacreons lute
and he shall melt his wing that shall aspire
to reach a fancy or one accent higher
holland and france have known his nobler parts
and found him excellent in arms and arts
to sum up all few men of fame but know
he was tam marti quam mercurio


thy pious hand planting fraternal bayes
deserving is of most egregious praise
since tis the organ doth to us convey
from a descended sun so bright a ray
clear spirit how much we are bound to thee
for this so great a liberalitie
the truer worth of which by much exceeds
the western wealth which such contention breeds
like the infusinggod from the wellhead
of poesie you have besprinkled
our brows with holy drops the very last
which from your brothers happy pen were cast


yet as the last the best such matchlesse skill
from his divine alembick did distill
your honourd brother in the elyzian shade
will joy to know himself a laureat made
by your religious care and that his urn
doth him on earth immortal life return
your self you have a good physician shown
to his much grieved friends and to your own


in giving this elixird medecine
for greatest grief a soveraign anodine
sir from your brother y have conveyd us bliss
now since your genius so concurs with his
let your own quill our next enjoyments frame
all must be rich thats gracd with lovelace name


great son of mars and of minerva too
with what oblations must we come to woo
thy sacred soul to look down from above
and see how much thy memory we love
whose happy pen so pleased amorous ears
and lifting bright lucasta to the sphears
her in the starbespangled orb did set
above fair ariadnes coronet
leaving a pattern to succeeding wits
by which to sing forth their pythonick fits


shall we bring tears and sighs no no then we
should but bemone our selves for loosing thee
or else thy happiness seem to deny
or to repine at thy felicity
then whilst we chant out thine immortal praise
our offerings shall be onely sprigs of bays
and if our tears will needs their brinks outfly
wel weep them forth into an elegy
to tell the world how deep fates wounded wit
when atropos the lovely lovelace hit
how th active fire which cloathd thy genrous mind
consumd the water and the earth calcind


untill a stronger heat by death was given
which sublimated thy poor soul to heaven
thou knewst right well to guide the warlike steed
and yet couldst court the muses with full speed
and such success that the inspiring nine
have filld their thespian fountain so with brine
henceforth we can expect no lyrick lay
but biting satyres through the world must stray
bellona joyns with fair erato too
and with the destinies do keep adoe
whom thus she queries could not you awhile
reprieve his life until another file
of poems such as these had been drawn up
the fates replyd that thou wert taken up
a sacrifice unto the deities
since things most perfect please their holy eyes
and that no other victim could be found
with so much learning and true virtue crownd
since it is so in peace for ever rest
tis very just that god should have the best


lovelace is dead then let the world return
to its first chaos mufled in its urn
the stars and elements together lye
drenchd in perpetual obscurity
and the whole machine in confusion be
as immethodick as an anarchie
may the great eye of day weep out his light
pale cynthia leave the regiment of night
the galaxia all in sables dight
send forth no corruscations to our sight
the sistergraces and the sacred nine
statud with grief attend upon his shrine
whose worth whose loss should we but truly rate
twould puzzle our arithmetic to state
th accompt of vertus so transcendent high
number and value reach infinity


did i pronounce him dead no no he lives
and from his aromatique cell he gives
spicebreathed fumes whose odoriferous scent
in zephregales which never can be spent
doth spread it self abroad and much outvies
the eastern bird in her selfsacrifice
or father phoebus who to th world derives
such various and such multiformed lives
took notice that brave lovelace did inspire
the universe with his promethean fire
and snatcht him hence before his thread was spun
enving that here should be another sun


tread reader gently gently ore
the happy dust beneath this floor
for in this narrow vault is set
an alablaster cabinet
wherein both arts and arms were put
like homers iliads in a nut
till death with slow and easie pace
snatcht the bright jewell from the case
and now transformd he doth arise
a constellation in the skies
teaching the blinded world the way
through night to startle into day
and shipwrackt shades with steady hand
he steers unto th elizian land


this is the month and this the happy morn
wherin the son of heavns eternal king
of wedded maid and virgin mother born
our great redemption from above did bring
for so the holy sages once did sing
that he our deadly forfeit should release
and with his father work us a perpetual peace


that glorious form that light unsufferable
and that farbeaming blaze of majesty
wherwith he wont at heavns high counceltable
to sit the midst of trinal unity
he laid aside and here with us to be
forsook the courts of everlasting day
and chose with us a darksom house of mortal clay


say heavnly muse shall not thy sacred vein
afford a present to the infant god
hast thou no vers no hymn or solemn strein
to welcom him to this his new abode
now while the heavn by the suns team untrod
hath took no print of the approching light
and all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright


see how from far upon the eastern rode
the starled wisards haste with odours sweet
o run prevent them with thy humble ode
and lay it lowly at his blessed feet
have thou the honour first thy lord to greet
and joyn thy voice unto the angel quire
from out his secret altar toucht with hallowd fire


it was the winter wilde
while the heavnbornchilde
all meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies
nature in aw to him
had dofft her gawdy trim
with her great master so to sympathize
it was no season then for her
to wanton with the sun her lusty paramour


only with speeches fair
she wood the gentle air
to hide her guilty front with innocent snow
and on her naked shame
pollute with sinfull blame
the saintly vail of maiden white to throw
confounded that her makers eyes
should look so near upon her foul deformities


but he her fears to cease
sent down the meekeyd peace
she crownd with olive green came softly sliding
down through the turning sphear
his ready harbinger
with turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing
and waving wide her mirtle wand
she strikes a universall peace through sea and land


no war or battails sound
was heard the world around
the idle spear and shield were high up hung
the hooked chariot stood
unstaind with hostile blood
the trumpet spake not to the armed throng
and kings sate still with awfull eye
as if they surely knew their sovran lord was by


but peacefull was the night
wherin the prince of light
his raign of peace upon the earth began
the windes with wonder whist
smoothly the waters kist
whispering new joyes to the milde ocean
who now hath quite forgot to rave
while birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave


the stars with deep amaze
stand fit in steadfast gaze
bending one way their pretious influence
and will not take their flight
for all the morning light
or lucifer that often warned them thence
but in their glimmering orbs did glow
until their lord himself bespake and bid them go


and though the shady gloom
had given day her room
the sun himself withheld his wonted speed
and hid his head for shame
as his inferior flame
the new enlightened world no more should need
he saw a greater sun appear
then his bright throne or burning axletree could bear


the shepherds on the lawn
or ere the point of dawn
sate simply chatting in a rustic row
full little thought they than
that the mighty pan
was kindly com to live with them below
perhaps their loves or els their sheep
was all that did their silly thoughts so busie keep


when such musick sweet
their hearts and ears did greet
as never was by mortal finger strook
divinelywarbled voice
answering the stringed noise
as all their souls in blisfull rapture took
the air such pleasure loth to lose
with thousand echos still prolongs each heavnly close


nature that heard such sound
beneath the hollow round
of cynthias seat the airy region thrilling
now was almost won
to think her part was don
and that her raign had here its last fulfilling
she knew such harmony alone
could hold all heavn and earth in happier union


at last surrounds their sight
a globe of circular light
that with long beams the shame faced night arrayed
the helmed cherubim
and sworded seraphim
are seen in glittering ranks with wings displaid
harping in loud and solemn quire
with unexpressive notes to heavns newborn heir


such musick as tis said
before was never made
but when of old the sons of morning sung
while the creator great
his constellations set
and the wellballanct world on hinges hung
and cast the dark foundations deep
and bid the weltring waves their oozy channel keep


ring out ye crystall sphears
once bless our human ears
if ye have power to touch our senses so
and let your silver chime
move in melodious time
and let the base of heavns deep organ blow
and with your ninefold harmony
make up full consort to thangelike symphony


for if such holy song
enwrap our fancy long
time will run back and fetch the age of gold
and speckld vanity
will sicken soon and die
and leprous sin will melt from earthly mould
and hell it self will pass away
and leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day


yea truth and justice then
will down return to men
thenameld arras of the rainbow wearing
and mercy set between
thrond in celestiall sheen
with radiant feet the tissued clouds down stearing
and heavn as at som festivall
will open wide the gates of her high palace hall


but wisest fate sayes no
this must not yet be so
the babe lies yet in smiling infancy
that on the bitter cross
must redeem our loss
so both himself and us to glorifie
yet first to those ychaind in sleep
the wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep


with such a horrid clang
as on mount sinai rang
while the red fire and smouldring clouds out brake
the aged earth agast
with terrour of that blast
shall from the surface to the center shake
when at the worlds last session
the dreadfull judge in middle air shall spread his throne


and then at last our bliss
full and perfect is
but now begins for from this happy day
thold dragon under ground
in straiter limits bound
not half so far casts his usurped sway
and wrath to see his kingdom fail
swindges the scaly horrour of his foulded tail


the oracles are dumm
no voice or hideous humm
runs through the arched roof in words deceiving
apollo from his shrine
can no more divine
with hollow shreik the steep of delphos leaving
no nightly trance or breathed spell
inspires the paleeyd priest from the prophetic cell


the lonely mountains ore
and the resounding shore
a voice of weeping heard and loud lament
from haunted spring and dale
edgd with poplar pale
the parting genius is with sighing sent
with flowreinwovn tresses torn
the nimphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn


in consecrated earth
and on the holy hearth
the lars and lemures moan with midnight plaint
in urns and altars round
a drear and dying sound
affrights the flamins at their service quaint
and the chill marble seems to sweat
while each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat


peor and baalim
forsake their temples dim
with that twisebatterd god of palestine
and mooned ashtaroth
heavns queen and mother both
now sits not girt with tapers holy shine
the libyc hammon shrinks his horn
in vain the tyrian maids their wounded thamuz mourn


and sullen moloch fled
hath left in shadows dred
his burning idol all of blackest hue
in vain with cymbals ring
they call the grisly king
in dismall dance about the furnace blue
and brutish gods of nile as fast
lsis and orus and the dog anubis hast


erewhile of musick and ethereal mirth
wherwith the stage of ayr and earth did ring
and joyous news of heavnly infants birth
my muse with angels did divide to sing
but headlong joy is ever on the wing
in wintry solstice like the shortnd light
soon swallowd up in dark and long outliving night


for now to sorrow must i tune my song
and set my harpe to notes of saddest wo
which on our dearest lord did sease ere long
dangers and snares and wrongs and worse then so
which he for us did freely undergo
most perfect heroe tryd in heaviest plight
of labours huge and hard too hard for human wight


he sovran priest stooping his regall head
that dropt with odorous oil down his fair eyes
poor fleshly tabernacle entered
his starry front lowrooft beneath the skies
o what a mask was there what a disguise
yet more the stroke of death he must abide
then lies him meekly down fast by his brethrens side


these latter scenes confine my roving vers
to this horizon is my phoebus bound
his godlike acts and his temptations fierce
and former sufferings other where are found
loud ore the rest cremonas trump doth sound
me softer airs befit and softer strings
of lute or viol still more apt for mournful things


befriend me night best patroness of grief
over the pole thy thickest mantle throw
and work my flatterd fancy to belief
that heavn and earth are colourd with my wo
my sorrows are too dark for day to know
the leaves should all be black wheron i write
and letters where my tears have washt a wannish white


see see the chariot and those rushing wheels
that whirld the prophet up at chebar flood
my spirit som transporting cherub feels
to bear me where the towers of salem stood
once glorious towers now sunk in guiltles blood
there doth my soul in holy vision sit
in pensive trance and anguish and ecstatick fit


mine eye hath found that sad sepulchral rock
that was the casket of heavns richest store
and here though grief my feeble hands uplock
yet on the softned quarry would i score
my plaining vers as lively as before
for sure so well instructed are my tears
they would fitly fall in orderd characters


i thence hurried on viewles wing
take up a weeping on the mountains wilde
the gentle neighbourhood of grove and spring
would soon unboosom all their echoes milde
and i for grief is easily beguild
might think thinfection of my sorrows bound
had got a race of mourners on som pregnant cloud


this rich marble doth enterr
the honourd wife of winchester
a vicounts daughter an earls heir
besides what her vertues fair
added to her noble birth
more then she could own from earth
summers three times eight save one
she had told alas too soon
after so short time of breath
to house with darknes and with death
yet had the number of her days
bin as compleat as was her praise
nature and fate had had no strife
in giving limit to her life
her high birth and her graces sweet
quickly found a lover meet
the virgin quire for her request
the god that sits at marriage feast
he at their invoking came
but with a scarcewellighted flame
and in his garland as he stood
ye might discern a cipress bud
once had the early matrons run
to greet her of a lovely son
and now with second hope she goes
and calls lucina to her throws
but whether by mischance or blame
atropos for lucina came
and with remorsles cruelty
spoild at once both fruit and tree
the haples babe before his birth
had burial yet not laid in earth
and the languisht mothers womb
was not long a living tomb
so have i seen som tender slip
savd with care from winters nip
the pride of her carnation train
pluckt up by som unheedy swain
who onely thought to crop the flowr
new shot up from vernall showr
but the fair blossom hangs the head
sideways as on a dying bed
and those pearls of dew she wears
prove to be presaging tears
which the sad morn had let fall
on her hastning funerall
gentle lady may thy grave
peace and quiet ever have
after this thy travail sore
sweet rest sease thee evermore
that to give the world encrease
shortned hast thy own lives lease
here besides the sorrowing
that thy noble house doth bring
here be tears of perfect moan
weept for thee in helicon
and som flowers and som bays
for thy hears to strew the ways
sent thee from the banks of came
devoted to thy vertuous name
whilst thou bright saint high sitst in glory
next her much like to thee in story
that fair syrian shepherdess
who after yeers of barrennes
the highly favourd joseph bore
to him that servd for her before
and at her next birth much like thee
through pangs fled to felicity
far within the boosom bright
of blazing majesty and light
there with thee new welcom saint
like fortunes may her soul acquaint
with thee there clad in radiant sheen
no marchioness but now a queen


what needs my shakespear for his honourd bones
the labour of an age in piled stones
or that his hallowd reliques should be hid
under a starypointing pyramid
dear son of memory great heir of fame
what needst thou such weak witnes of thy name
thou in our wonder and astonishment
hast built thy self a livelong monument
for whilst to thsharne of slowendeavouring art
thy easie numbers flow and that each heart
hath from the leaves of thy unvalud book
those delphick lines with deep impression took
then thou our fancy of it self bereaving
dost make us marble with too much conceaving
and so sepulcherd in such pomp dost lie
that kings for such a tomb would wish to die


here lies old hobson death hath broke his girt
and here alas hath laid him in the dirt
or els the ways being foul twenty to one
hes here stuck in a slough and overthrown
twas such a shifter that if truth were known
death was half glad when he had got him down
for he had any time this ten yeers full
dodgd with him betwixt cambridge and the bull
and surely death could never have prevaild
had not his weekly cours of carriage faild
but lately finding him so long at home
and thinking now his journeys end was come
and that he had tane up his latest inne
in the kind office of a chamberlin
shewd him his room where he must lodge that night
pulld off his boots and took away the light
if any ask for him it shall be sed
hobson has supt and s newly gon to bed


here lieth one who did most truly prove
that he could never die while he could move
so hung his destiny never to rot
while he might still jogg on and keep his trot
made of sphearmetal never to decay
untill his revolution was at stay
time numbers motion yet without a crime
gainst old truth motion numberd out his time
and like an engin movd with wheel and waight
his principles being ceast he ended strait
rest that gives all men life gave him his death
and too much breathing put him out of breath
nor were it contradiction to affirm
too long vacation hastned on his term
meerly to drive the time away he sicknd
fainted and died nor would with ale be quicknd
nay quoth he on his swooning bed outstretchd
if i may not carry sure ile nere be fetchd
but vow though the cross doctors all stood hearers
for one carrier put down to make six bearers
ease was his chief disease and to judge right
he did for heavines that his cart went light
his leasure told him that his time was com
and lack of load made his life burdensom
that even to his last breath ther be that sayt
as he were prest to death he cryd more waight
but had his doings lasted as they were
he had bin an immortall carrier
obedient to the moon he spent his date
in cours reciprocal and had his fate
linkt to the mutual flowing of the seas
yet strange to think his wain was his increase
his letters are deliverd all and gon
onely remains this superscription


where brooding darknes spreads his jealous wings
and the nightraven sings
there under ebon shades and lowbrowd rocks
as ragged as thy locks
but com thou goddes fair and free
in heavn ycleapd euphrosyne
and by men hearteasing mirth
whom lovely venus at a birth
with two sister graces more
to ivycrowned bacchus bore
or whether as som sager sing
the frolick wind that breathes the spring
zephir with aurora playing
as he met her once a maying
there on beds of violets blew
and freshblown roses washt in dew
filld her with thee a daughter fair
so bucksom blith and debonair
haste thee nymph and bring with thee
jest and youthful jollity
quips and cranks and wanton wiles
nods and becks and wreathed smiles
such as hang on hebes cheek
and love to live in dimple sleek
sport that wrincled care derides
and laughter holding both his sides
com and trip it as ye go
on the light fantastick toe
and in thy right hand lead with thee
the mountain nymph sweet liberty
and if i give thee honour due
mirth admit me of thy crue
to live with her and live with thee
in unreproved pleasures free
to hear the lark begin his flight
and singing startle the dull night
from his watchtowre in the skies
till the dappled dawn doth rise
then to com in spight of sorrow
and at my window bid good morrow
through the sweetbriar or the vine
or the twisted eglantine
while the cock with lively din
scatters the rear of darknes thin
and to the stack or the barn dore
stoutly struts his dames before
oft listning how the hounds and horn
chearly rouse the slumbring morn
from the side of som hoar hill
through the high wood echoing shrill
som time walking not unseen
by hedgerow elms on hillocks green
right against the eastern gate
wher the great sun begins his state
robd in flames and amber light
the clouds in thousand liveries dight
while the plowman neer at hand
whistles ore the furrowd land
and the milkmaid singeth blithe
and the mower whets his sithe
and every shepherd tells his tale
under the hawthorn in the dale
streit mine eye hath caught new pleasures
whilst the lantskip round it measures
russet lawns and fallows gray
where the nibling flocks do stray
mountains on whose barren brest
the labouring clouds do often rest
meadows trim with daisies pide
shallow brooks and rivers wide
towers and battlements it sees
boosomd high in tufted trees
wher perhaps som beauty lies
the cynosure of neighbouring eyes
hard by a cottage chimney smokes
from betwixt two aged okes
where corydon and thyrsis met
are at their savory dinner set
of hearbs and other country messes
which the neathanded phillis dresses
and then in haste her bowre she leaves
with thestylis to bind the sheaves
or if the earlier season lead
to the tannd haycock in the mead
som times with secure delight
the upland hamlets will invite
when the merry bells ring round
and the jocond rebecks sound
to many a youth and many a maid
dancing in the chequerd shade
and young and old com forth to play
on a sunshine holyday
till the livelong daylight fail
then to the spicy nutbrown ale
with stories told of many a feat
how faery mab the junkets eat
she was pincht and pulld she sed
and he by friars lanthorn led
tells how the drudging goblin swet
to ern his creambowle duly set
when in one night ere glimps of morn
his shadowy flale hath threshd the corn
that ten daylabourers could not end
then lies him down the lubbar fend
and stretchd out all the chimneys length
basks at the fire his hairy strength
and cropfull out of dores he flings
ere the first cock his mattin rings
thus don the tales to bed they creep
by whispering windes soon lulld asleep
towred cities please us then
and the busie humm of men
where throngs of knights and barons bold
in weeds of peace high triumphs hold
with store of ladies whose bright eies
rain influence and judge the prise
of wit or arms while both contend
to win her grace whom all commend
there let hymen oft appear
in saffron robe with taper clear
and pomp and feast and revelry
with mask and antique pageantry
such sights as youthfull poets dream
on summer eeves by haunted stream
then to the welltrod stage anon
if jonsons learned sock be on
or sweetest shakespear fancies childe
warble his native woodnotes wilde
and ever against eating cares
lap me in soft lydian aires
married to immortal verse
such as the meeting soul may pierce
in notes with many a winding bout
of lincked sweetnes long drawn out
with wanton heed and giddy cunning
the melting voice through mazes running
untwisting all the chains that ty
the hidden soul of harmony
that orpheus self may heave his head
from golden slumber on a bed
of heapt elysian flowres and hear
such streins as would have won the ear
of pluto to have quite set free
his half regaind eurydice


these delights if thou canst give
mirth with thee i mean to live
and fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess
as thick and numberless
as the gay motes that people the sun beams
or likest hovering dreams
but hail thou goddess sage and holy
hail divinest melancholy
whose saintly visage is too bright
to hit the sense of human sight
and therefore to our weaker view
ore laid with black staid wisdoms hue
black but such as in esteem
prince memnons sister might beseem
or that starrd ethiope queen that strove
to set her beauties praise above
the sea nymphs and their powers offended
yet thou art higher far descended
thee brighthaird vesta long of yore
to solitary saturn bore
his daughter she in saturns raign
such mixture was not held a stain
oft in glimmering bowres and glades
he met her and in secret shades
of woody idas inmost grove
while yet there was no fear of jove
com pensive nun devout and pure
sober stedfast and demure
all in a robe of darkest grain
flowing with majestick train
and sable stole of cipres lawn
over thy decent shoulders drawn
com but keep thy wonted state
with eevn step and musing gate
and looks commercing with the skies
thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes
there held in holy passion still
forget thy self to marble till
with a sad leaden downward cast
thou fix them on the earth as fast
and joyn with thee calm peace and quiet
spare fast that oft with gods doth diet
and hears the muses in a ring
ay round about joves altar sing
and adde to these retired leasure
that in trim gardens takes his pleasure
but first and chiefest with thee bring
him that yon soars on golden wing
guiding the fierywheeled throne
the cherub contemplation
and the mute silence hist along
less philomel will daign a song
in her sweetest saddest plight
smoothing the rugged brow of night
while cynthia checks her dragon yoke
gently ore thaccustomd oke
sweet bird that shunnst the noise of folly
most musical most melancholy
thee chauntress oft the woods among
i woo to hear thy eevensong
and missing thee i walk unseen
on the dry smoothshaven green
to behold the wandring moon
riding neer her highest noon
like one that had bin led astray
through the heavns wide pathles way
and oft as if her head she bowd
stooping through a fleecy cloud
oft on a plat of rising ground
i hear the faroff curfeu sound
over som widewaterd shoar
swinging slow with sullen roar
or if the ayr will not permit
som still removed place will fit
where glowing embers through the room
teach light to counterfeit a gloom
far from all resort of mirth
save the cricket on the hearth
or the belmans drowsie charm
to bless the dores from nightly harm
or let my lamp at midnight hour
be seen in som high lonely towr
where i may oft outwatch the bear
with thrice great hermes or unsphear
the spirit of plato to unfold
what worlds or what vast regions hold
the immortal mind that hath forsook
her mansion in this fleshly nook
and of those daemons that are found
in fire air flood or under ground
whose power hath a true consent
with planet or with element
som time let gorgeous tragedy
in scepterd pall com sweeping by
presenting thebs or pelops line
or the tale of troy divine
or what though rare of later age
ennobled hath the buskind stage
but o sad virgin that thy power
might raise musaeus from his bower
or bid the soul of orpheus sing
such notes as warbled to the string
drew iron tears down plutos cheek
and made hell grant what love did seek
or call up him that left half told
the story of cambuscan bold
of camball and of algarsife
and who had canace to wife
that ownd the vertuous ring and glass
and of the wondrous hors of brass
on which the tartar king did ride
and if ought els great bards beside
in sage and solemn tunes have sung
of turneys and of trophies hung
of forests and inchantments drear
where more is meant then meets the ear
thus night oft see me in thy pale career
till civilsuited morn appeer
not trickt and frounct as she was wont
with the attick boy to hunt
but chercheft in a comly cloud
while rocking winds are piping loud
or usherd with a shower still
when the gust hath blown his fill
ending on the russling leaves
with minute drops from off the eaves
and when the sun begins to fling
his flaring beams me goddes bring
to arched walks of twilight groves
and shadows brown that sylvan loves
of pine or monumental oake
where the rude ax with heaved stroke
was never heard the nymphs to daunt
or fright them from their hallowd haunt
there in close covert by som brook
where no profaner eye may look
hide me from days garish eie
while the bee with honied thie
that at her flowry work doth sing
and the waters murmuring
with such consort as they keep
entice the dewyfeatherd sleep
and let som strange mysterious dream
wave at his wings in airy stream
of lively portrature displayd
softly on my eyelids laid
and as i wake sweet musick breath
above about or underneath
sent by som spirit to mortals good
or thunseen genius of the wood
but let my due feet never fail
to walk the studious cloysters pale
and love the high embowed roof
with antick pillars massy proof
and storied windows richly dight
casting a dimm religious light
there let the pealing organ blow
to the full voicd quire below
in service high and anthems cleer
as may with sweetnes through mine ear
dissolve me into extasies
and bring all heavn before mine eyes
and may at last my weary age
find out the peacefull hermitage
the hairy gown and mossy cell
where i may sit and rightly spell
of every star that heavn doth shew
and every herb that sips the dew
till old experience do attain
to somthing like prophetic strain
these pleasures melancholy give
and i with thee will choose to live


gen stay gentle swains for though in this disguise
i see bright honour sparkle through your eyes
of famous arcady ye are and sprung
of that renowned flood so often sung
divine alpheus who by secret sluse
stole under seas to meet his arethuse
and ye the breathing roses of the wood
fair silverbuskind nymphs as great and good
i know this quest of yours and free intent
was all in honour and devotion ment
to the great mistres of yon princely shrine
whom with low reverence i adore as mine
and with all helpful service will comply
to further this nights glad solemnity
and lead ye where ye may more neer behold
what shallowsearching fame hath left untold
which i full oft amidst these shades alone
have sate to wonder at and gaze upon
for know by lot from jove i am the powr
of this fair wood and live in oakn bowr
to nurse the saplings tall and curl the grove
with ringlets quaint and wanton windings wove
and all my plants i save from nightly ill
of noisom winds and blasting vapours chill
and from the boughs brush off the evil dew
and heal the harms of thwarting thunder blew
or what the cross direlooking planet smites
or hurtfull worm with cankerd venom bites
when eevning gray doth rise i fetch my round
over the mount and all this hallowd ground
and early ere the odorous breath of morn
awakes the slumbring leaves or tasseld horn
shakes the high thicket haste i all about
number my ranks and visit every sprout
with puissant words and murmurs made to bless
but els in deep of night when drowsines
hath lockt up mortal sense then listen i
to the celestial sirens harmony
that sit upon the nine enfolded sphears
and sing to those that hold the vital shears
and turn the adamantine spindle round
on which the fate of gods and men is wound
such sweet compulsion doth in musick ly
to lull the daughters of necessity
and keep unsteddy nature to her law
and the low world in measurd motion draw
after the heavenly tune which none can hear
of human mould with grosse unpurged ear
and yet such musick worthiest were to blaze
the peerles height of her immortal praise
whose lustre leads us and for her most fit
if my inferior hand or voice could hit
inimitable sounds yet as we go
what ere the skill of lesser gods can show
i will assay her worth to celebrate
and so attend ye toward her glittering state
where ye may all that are of noble stemm
approach and kiss her sacred vestures hemm


ore the smooth enameld green
where no print of step hath been
follow me as i sing
and touch the warbled string
under the shady roof
of branching elm starproof
follow me
i will bring you where she sits
clad in splendor as befits
her deity
such a rural queen
all arcadia hath not seen


nymphs and shepherds dance no more
by sandy ladons lillied banks
on old lycaeus or cyllene hoar
trip no more in twilight ranks
though erynanth your loss deplore
a better soyl shall give ye thanks
from the stony maenalus
bring your flocks and live with us
here ye shall have greater grace
to serve the lady of this place
though syrinx your pans mistres were
yet syrinx well might wait on her
such a rural queen
all arcadia hath not seen


listen and appear to us
in name of great oceanus
by the earthshaking neptunes mace
and tethys grave majestick pace
by hoary nereus wrincled look
and the carpathian wisards hook
by scaly tritons winding shell
and old soothsaying glaucus spell
by leucotheas lovely hands
and her son that rules the strands
by thetis tinselslipperd feet
and the songs of sirens sweet
by dead parthenopes dear tomb
and fair ligeas golden comb
wherwith she sits on diamond rocks
sleeking her soft alluring locks
by all the nymphs that nightly dance
upon thy streams with wily glance
rise rise and heave thy rosie head
from thy coralpavn bed
and bridle in thy headlong wave
till thou our summons answered have


sab by the rushyfringed bank
where grows the willow and the osier dank
my sliding chariot stayes
thick set with agat and the azurn sheen
of turkis blew and emrauld green
that in the channell strayes


whilst from off the waters fleet
thus i set my printless feet
ore the cowslips velvet head
that bends not as i tread
com lady while heaven lends us grace
let us fly this cursed place
lest the sorcerer us intice
with som other new device
not a waste or needless sound
till we com to holier ground
i shall be your faithfull guide
through this gloomy covert wide
and not many furlongs thence
is your fathers residence
where this night are met in state
many a friend to gratulate
his wisht presence and beside
all the swains that there abide
with jiggs and rural dance resort
we shall catch them at their sport
and our sudden coming there
will double all their mirth and chere
com let us haste the stars grow high
but night sits monarch yet in the mid sky


spir back shepherds back anough your play
till next sunshine holiday
here be without duck or nod
other trippings to be trod
of lighter toes and such court guise
as mercury did first devise
with the mincing dryades
on the lawns and on the leas


noble lord and lady bright
i have brought ye new delight
here behold so goodly grown
three fair branches of your own
heavn hath timely trid their youth
their faith their patience and their truth
and sent them here through hard assays
with a crown of deathless praise
to triumph in victorious dance
ore sensual folly and intemperance


spir to the ocean now i fly
and those happy climes that ly
where day never shuts his eye
up in the broad fields of the sky
there i suck the liquid ayr
all amidst the gardens fair
of hesperus and his daughters three
that sing about the golden tree
iris there with humid bow
waters the odorous banks that blow
flowers of more mingled hew
then her purfld scarf can shew
and drenches with elysian dew
list mortals if your ears be true
beds of hyacinth and roses
where young adonis oft reposes
waxing well of his deep wound
in slumber soft and on the ground
sadly sits th assyrian queen
but far above in spangled sheen
celestial cupid her famd son advanct
holds his dear psyche sweet intranct
after her wandring labours long
till free consent the gods among
make her his eternal bride
and from her fair unspotted side
two blissful twins are to be born
youth and joy so jove hath sworn


but now my task is smoothly don
i can fly or i can run
quickly to the green earths end
where the bowd welkin slow doth bend
and from thence can soar as soon
to the corners of the moon
mortals that would follow me
love vertue she alone is free
she can teach ye how to clime
higher then the spheary chime
or if vertue feeble were
heavn it self would stoop to her


hail native language that by sinews weak
didst move my first endeavouring tongue to speak
and madst imperfect words with childish tripps
half unpronounct slide through my infantlipps
driving dum silence from the portal dore
where he had mutely sate two years before
here i salute thee and thy pardon ask
that now i use thee in my latter task
small loss it is that thence can come unto thee
i know my tongue but little grace can do thee
thou needst not be ambitious to be first
believe me i have thither packt the worst
and if it happen as i did forecast
the daintest dishes shall be servd up last
i pray thee then deny me not thy aide
for this same small neglect that i have made
but haste thee strait to do me once a pleasure
and from thy wardrope bring thy chiefest treasure
not those new fangled toys and triming slight
which takes our late fantasticks with delight
but cull those richest robes and gayst attire
which deepest spirits and choicest wits desire
i have some naked thoughts that rove about
and loudly knock to have their passage out
and wearie of their place do only stay
till thou hast deckt them in thy best aray
that so they may without suspect or fears
fly swiftly to this fair assemblys ears
yet i had rather if i were to chuse
thy service in some graver subject use
such as may make thee search thy coffers round
before thou cloath my fancy in fit sound
such where the deep transported mind may scare
above the wheeling poles and at heavns dore
look in and see each blissful deitie
how he before the thunderous throne doth lie
listening to what unshorn apollo sings
to thtouch of golden wires while hebe brings
immortal nectar to her kingly sire
then passing through the spherse of watchful fire
and mistie regions of wide air next under
and hills of snow and lofts of piled thunder
may tell at length how greeneyd neptune raves
in heavns defiance mustering all his waves
then sing of secret things that came to pass
when beldam nature in her cradle was
and last of kings and queens and heros old
such as the wise demodocus once told
in solemn songs at king alcinous feast
while sad ulisses soul and all the rest
are held with his melodious harmonie
in willing chains and sweet captivitie
but fie my wandring muse how thou dost stray
expectance calls thee now another way
thou knowst it must he now thy only bent
to keep in compass of thy predicament
then quick about thy purposd business come
that to the next i may resign my roome
good luck befriend thee son for at thy birth
the faiery ladies daunct upon the hearth
thy drowsie nurse hath sworn she did them spie
come tripping to the room where thou didst lie
and sweetly singing round about thy bed
strew all their blessings on thy sleeping head
she heard them give thee this that thou shouldst still
from eyes of mortals walk invisible
yet there is something that doth force my fear
for once it was my dismal hap to hear
a sybil old bowbent with crooked age
that far events full wisely could presage
and in times long and dark prospective glass
foresaw what future dayes should bring to pass
your son said she nor can you it prevent
shall subject be to many an accident
ore all his brethren he shall reign as king
yet every one shall make him underling
and those that cannot live from him asunder
ungratefully shall strive to keep him under
in worth and excellence he shall outgo them
yet being above them he shall be below them
from others he shall stand in need of nothing
yet on his brothers shall depend for cloathing
to find a foe it shall not be his hap
and peace shall lull him in her flowry lap
yet shall he live in strife and at his dore
devouring war shall never cease to roare
yea it shall be his natural property
to harbour those that are at enmity
what power what force what mighty spell if not
your learned hands can loose this gordian knot
rivers arise whether thou be the son
of utmost tweed or oose or gulphie dun
or trent who like some earthborn giant spreads
his thirty armes along the indented meads
or sullen mole that runneth underneath
or severn swift guilty of maidens death
or rockie avon or of sedgie lee
or coaly tine or antient hallowed dee
or humber loud that keeps the scythians name
or medway smooth or royal towred thame


blessd is the man who hath not walkd astray
in counsel of the wicked and ithway
of sinners hath not stood and in the seat
of scorners hath not sate but in the great
jehovahs law is ever his delight
and in his law he studies day and night
he shall be as a tree which planted grows
by watry streams and in his season knows
to yield his fruit and his leaf shall not fall
and what he takes in hand shall prosper all
not so the wicked but as chaff which fannd
the wind drives so the wicked shall not stand
in judgment or abide their tryal then
nor sinners in thassembly of just men
for the lord knows thupright way of the just
and the way of bad men to ruine must


o jehovah our lord how wondrous great
and glorious is thy name through all the earth
so as above the heavens thy praise to set
out of the tender mouths of latest bearth


out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou
hast founded strength because of all thy foes
to stint thenemy and slack thavengers brow
that bends his rage thy providence to oppose


when i behold thy heavens thy fingers art
the moon and starrs which thou so bright hast set
in the pure firmament then saith my heart
o what is man that thou remembrest yet


and thinkst upon him or of man begot
that him thou visitst and of him art found
scarce to be less then gods thou madst his lot
with honour and with state thou hast him crownd


ore the works of thy hand thou madst him lord
thou hast put all under his lordly feet
all flocks and herds by thy commanding word
all beasts that in the field or forrest meet


fowl of the heavens and fish that through the wet
seapaths in shoals do slide and know no dearth
o jehovah our lord how wondrous great
and glorious is thy name through all the earth


thou shepherd that dost israel keep
give ear in time of need
who leadest like a flock of sheep
thy loved josephs seed
that sittst between the cherubs bright
between their wings outspread
shine forth and from thy cloud give light
and on our foes thy dread


in ephraims view and benjamins
and in manasses sight
awake thy strength come and be seen
to save us by thy might


turn us again thy grace divine
to us o god vouchsafe
cause thou thy face on us to shine
and then we shall be safe


lord god of hosts how long wilt thou
how long wilt thou declare
thy smoaking wrath and angry brow
against thy peoples praire


thou feedst them with the bread of tears
their bread with tears they eat
and makst them largely drink the tears
wherewith their cheeks are wet


a strife thou makst us and a prey
to every neighbour foe
among themselves they laugh they play
and flouts at us they throw


return us and thy grace divine
o god of hosts vouchsafe
cause thou thy face on us to shine
and then we shall be safe


a vine from aegypt thou hast brought
thy free love made it thine
and drovst out nations proud and haut
to plant this lovely vine


thou didst prepare for it a place
and root it deep and fast
that it began to grow apace
and filld the land at last


with her green shade that coverd all
the hills were overspread
her bows as high as cedars tall
advancd their lofty head


her branches on the western side
down to the sea she sent
and upward to that river wide
her other branches went


why hast thou laid her hedges low
and brokn down her fence
that all may pluck her as they go
with rudest violence


the tusked boar out of the wood
up turns it by the roots
wild beasts there brouze and make their food
her grapes and tender shoots


return now god of hosts look down
from heavn thy seat divine
behold us but without a frown
and visit this thy vine


visit this vine which thy right hand
hath set and planted long
and the young branch that for thy self
thou hast made firm and strong


but now it is consumd with fire
and cut with axes down
they perish at thy dreadfull ire
at thy rebuke and frown


upon the man of thy right hand
let thy good hand be laid
upon the son of man whom thou
strong for thyself hast made


so shall we not go back from thee
to wayes of sin and shame
quickn us thou then gladly wee
shall call upon thy name
return us and thy grace divine
lord god of hosts voutsafe
cause thou thy face on us to shine
and then we shall be safe


to god our strength sing loud and clear
sing loud to god our king
to jacobs god that all may hear
loud acclamations ring


prepare a hymn prepare a song
the timbrel hither bring
the cheerfull psaltry bring along
and harp with pleasant string


blow as is wont in the new moon
with trumpets lofty sound
thappointed time the day wheron
our solemn feast comes round


this was a statute givn of old
for israel to observe
a law of jacobs god to hold
from whence they might not swerve


this he a testimony ordaind
in joseph not to change
when as he passd through aegypt land
the tongue i heard was strange


from burden and from slavish toyle
i set his shoulder free
his hands from pots and mirie soyle
deliverd were by me


when trouble did thee sore assaile
on me then didst thou call
and i to free thee did not faile
and led thee out of thrall
i answerd thee in thunder deep
with clouds encompassd round
i trid thee at the water steep
of meriba renownd


hear o my people hearkn well
i testifie to thee
thou antient flock of israel
if thou wilt list to mee


through out the land of thy abode
no alien god shall be
nor shalt thou to a forein god
in honour bend thy knee


i am the lord thy god which brought
thee out of aegypt land
ask large enough and i besought
will grant thy full demand


and yet my people would not hear
nor hearken to my voice
and israel whom i lovd so dear
mislikd me for his choice


then did i leave them to their will
and to their wandring mind
their own conceits they followd still
their own devises blind


o that my people would be wise
to serve me all their daies
and o that israel would advise
to walk my righteous waies


then would i soon bring down their foes
that now so proudly rise
and turn my hand against all those
that are their enemies


who hate the lord should then be fain
to bow to him and bend
but they his should remain
their time should have no end


and he would free them from the shock
with flower of finest wheat
and satisfie them from the rock
with honey for their meat


god in the great assembly stands
of kings and lordly states
among the gods on both his hands
he judges and debates


how long will ye pervert the right
with judgment false and wrong
favouring the wicked by your might
who thence grow bold and strong


regard the weak and fatherless
dispatch the poor mans cause
and raise the man in deep distress
by just and equal lawes


defend the poor and desolate
and rescue from the hands
of wicked men the low estate
of him that help demands


they know not nor will understand
in darkness they walk on
the earths foundations all are movd
and out of order gon


i said that ye were gods yea all
the sons of god most high
but ye shall die like men and fall
as other princes die


rise god judge thou the earth in might
this wicked earth redress
for thou art he who shalt by right
the nations all possess


be not thou silent now at length
o god hold not thy peace
sit not thou still o god of strength
we cry and do not cease


for lo thy furious foes now swell
and storm outrageously
and they that hate thee proud and fill
exalt their heads full hie


against thy people they contrive
their plots and counsels deep
them to ensnare they chiefly strive
whom thou dost hide and keep


come let us cut them off say they
till they no nation be
that israels name for ever may
be lost in memory


for they consult with all their might
and all as one in mind
themselves against thee they unite
and in firm union bind


the tents of edom and the brood
of scornful ishmael
moab with them of hagars blood
that in the desart dwell


gebal and ammon there conspire
and hateful amalec
the philistims and they of tyre
whose bounds the sea doth check


with them great asshur also bands
and doth confirm the knot
all these have lent their armed hands
to aid the sons of lot


do to them as to midian bold
that wasted all the coast
to sisera and as is told
thou didst to jabins hoast
when at the brook of kishon old
they were repulst and slain
at endor quite cut off and rowld
as dung upon the plain


as zeb and oreb evil sped
so let their princes speed
as zeba and zalmunna bled
so let their princes bleed


for they amidst their pride have said
by right now shall we seize
gods houses and will now invade
their stately palaces


my god oh make them as a wheel
no quiet let them find
giddy and restless let them reel
like stubble from the wind


as when an aged wood takes fire
which on a sudden straies
the greedy flame runs hier and hier
till all the mountains blaze


so with thy whirlwind them pursue
and with thy tempest chase
and till they yield thee honour due
lord fill with shame their face


ashamd and troubld let them be
troubld and shamd for ever
ever confounded and so die
with shame and scape it never


then shall they know that thou whose name
jehova is alone
art the most high and thou the same
ore all the earth art one


how lovely are thy dwellings fair
o lord of hoasts how dear
the pleasant tabernacles are
where thou dost dwell so near


my soul doth long and almost die
thy courts o lord to see
my heart and flesh aloud do crie
o living god for thee


there evn the sparrow freed from wrong
hath found a house of rest
the swallow there to lay her young
hath built her brooding nest


evn by thy altars lord of hoasts
they find their safe abode
and home they fly from round the coasts
toward thee my king my god


happy who in thy house reside
where thee they ever praise
happy whose strength in thee doth bide
and in their hearts thy waies


they pass through bacas thirstie vale
that dry and barren ground
as through a fruitfull watry dale
where springs and showrs abound


they journey on from strength to strength
with joy and gladsom cheer
till all before our god at length
in sion do appear


lord god of hoasts hear now my praier
o jacobs god give ear
thou god our shield look on the face
of thy anointed dear


for one day in thy courts to be
is better and mere blest
then in the joyes of vanity
a thousand daies at best


i in the temple of my god
had rather keep a dore
then dwell in tents and rich abode
with sin for evermore


for god the lord both sun and shield
gives grace and glory bright
no good from him shall be withheld
whose waies are just and right


lord god of hoasts that raign st on high
that man is truly blest
who only on thee doth relie
and in thee only rest


thy land to favour graciously
thou hast not lord been slack
thou hast from hard captivity
returned jacob back


th iniquity thou didst forgive
that wrought thy people woe
and all their sin that did thee grieve
hast hid where none shall know


thine anger all thou hadst removd
and calmly didst return
from thy fierce wrath which we had provd
far worse then fire to burn


god of our saving health and peace
turn us and us restore
thine indignation cause to cease
toward us and chide no more


wilt thou be angry without end
for ever angry thus
wilt thou thy frowning ire extend
from age to age on us


wilt thou not turn and hear our voice
and us again revive
that so thy people may rejoyce
by thee preservd alive


cause us to see thy goodness lord
to us thy mercy shew
thy saving health to us afford
and lift in us renew


and now what god the lord will speak
i will go strait and hear
for to his people he speaks peace
and to his saints full dear


to his dear saints he will speak peace
but let them never more
return to folly but surcease
to trespass as before


surely to such as do him fear
salvation is at hand
and glory shall ere long appear
to dwell within our land


mercy and truth that long were missd
now joyfully are met
sweet peace and righteousness have kissd
and hand in hand are set


truth from the earth like to a flowr
shall bud and blossom then
and justice from her heavenly bowr
look down on mortal men


the lord will also then bestow
whatever thing is good
our land shall forth in plenty throw
her fruits to be our food


before him righteousness shall go
his royal harbinger
then will he come and not be slow
his footsteps cannot err


thy gracious ear o lord encline
o hear me i thee pray
for i am poor and almost pine
with need and sad decay


preserve my soul for i have trod
thy waies and love the just
save thou thy servant o my god
who still in thee doth trust


pity me lord for daily thee
i call o make rejoyce
thy servants soul for lord to thee
i lift my soul and voice


for thou art good thou lord art prone
to pardon thou to all
art full of mercy thou alone
to them that on thee call


unto my supplication lord
give ear and to the crie
of my incessant praiers afford
thy hearing graciously


i in the day of my distress
will call on thee for aid
for thou wilt grant me free access
and answer what i prayd


like thee among the gods is none
o lord nor any works
of all that other gods have done
like to thy glorious works


the nations all whom thou hast made
shall come and all shall frame
to bow them low before thee lord
and glorifie thy name


for great thou art and wonders great
by thy strong hand are done
thou in thy everlasting seat
remainest god alone


teach me o lord thy way most right
i in thy truth will hide
to fear thy name my heart unite
so shall it never slide


thee will i praise o lord my god
thee honour and adore
with my whole heart and blaze abroad
thy name for ever more


for great thy mercy is toward me
and thou hast freed my soul
eevn from the lowest hell set free
from deepest darkness foul


o god the proud against me rise
and violent men are met
to seek my life and in their eyes
no fear of thee have set


but thou lord art the god most mild
readiest thy grace to shew
slow to be angry and art stild
most mercifull most true


o turn to me thy face at length
and me have mercy on
unto thy servant give thy strength
and save thy handmaids son


some sign of good to me afford
and let my foes then see
and be ashamd because thou lord
dost help and comfort me


among the holy mountains high
is his foundation fast
there seated in his sanctuary
his temple there is plact


sions fair gates the lord loves more
then all the dwellings faire
of jacobs land though there be store
and all within his care


city of god most glorious things
of thee abroad are spoke
i mention egypt where proud kings
did our forefathers yoke


i mention babel to my friends
philistia full of scorn
and tyre with ethiops utmost ends
lo this man there was born


but twise that praise shall in our ear
be said of sion last
this and this man was born in her
high god shall fix her fast


the lord shall write it in a scrowle
that nere shall be outworn
when he the nations doth enrowle
that this man there was born


both they who sing and they who dance
with sacred songs are there
in thee fresh brooks and soft streams glance
and all my fountains clear


lord god that dost me save and keep
all day to thee i cry
and all night long before thee weep
before thee prostrate lie


into thy presence let my praier
with sighs devout ascend
and to my cries that ceaseless are
thine ear with favour bend


for cloyd with woes and trouble store
surchargd my soul doth lie
my life at deaths uncherful dore
unto the grave draws nigh


recknd i am with them that pass
down to the dismal pit
i am a man but weak alas
and for that name unfit


from life dischargd and parted quite
among the dead to sleep
and like the slain in bloody fight
that in the grave lie deep


whom thou rememberest no more
dost never more regard
them from thy hand deliverd ore
deaths hideous house hath barrd


thou in the lowest pit profound
hast set me all forlorn
where thickest darkness hovers round
in horrid deeps to mourn


thy wrath from which no shelter saves
full sore doth press on me
thou breakst upon me all thy waves
and all thy waves break me


thou dost my friends from me estrange
and makst me odious
me to them odious for they change
and i here pent up thus


through sorrow and affliction great
mine eye grows dim and dead
lord all the day i thee entreat
my hands to thee i spread


wilt thou do wonders on the dead
shall the deceasd arise
and praise thee from their loathsom bed
with pale and hollow eyes


shall they thy loving kindness tell
on whom the grave hath hold
or they who in perdition dwell
thy faithfulness unfold


in darkness can thy mighty hand
or wondrous acts be known
thy justice in the gloomy land
of dark oblivion


but i to thee o lord do cry
ere yet my life be spent
and up to thee my praier doth hie
each morn and thee prevent


why wilt thou lord my soul forsake
and hide thy face from me
that am already bruisd and shake
with terror sent from thee


bruzd and afflicted and so low
as ready to expire
while i thy terrors undergo
astonishd with thine ire


thy fierce wrath over me doth flow
thy threatnings cut me through
all day they round about me go
like waves they me persue


lover and friend thou hast removd
and severd from me far
they fly me now whom i have lovd
and as in darkness are


when i beheld the poet blind yet bold
in slender book his vast design unfold
messiah crownd gods reconcild decree
rebelling angels the forbidden tree
heavn hell earth chaos all the argument
held me a while misdoubting his intent
that he would ruine for i saw him strong
the sacred truths to fable and old song
so sampson groapd the temples posts in spight
the world orewhelming to revenge his sight


yet as i read soon growing less severe
i likd his project the success did fear
through that wide field how he his way should find
ore which lame faith leads understanding blind
lest he perplexd the things he would explain
and what was easie he should render vain


or if a work so infinite he spannd
jealous i was that some less skilful hand
such as disquiet always what is well
and by ill imitating would excell
might hence presume the whole creations day
to change in scenes and show it in a play


pardon me mighty poet nor despise
my causeless yet not impious surmise
but i am now convincd and none will dare
within thy labours to pretend a share
thou hast not missd one thought that could be fit
and all that was improper dost omit
so that no room is here for writers left
but to detect their ignorance or theft


that majesty which through thy work doth reign
draws the devout deterring the profane
and things divine thou treatst of in such state
as them preserves and thee inviolate
at once delight and horrour on us seise
thou singst with so much gravity and ease


and above humane flight dost soar aloft
with plume so strong so equal and so soft
the bird namd from that paradise you sing
so never flaggs but always keeps on wing


where couldst thou words of such a compass find
whence furnish such a vast expence of mind
just heavn thee like tiresias to requite
rewards with prophesie thy loss of sight


well mightst thou scorn thy readers to allure
with tinkling rhime of thy own sense secure
while the townbayes writes all the while and spells
and like a packhorse tires without his bells
their fancies like our bushypoints appear
the poets tag them we for fashion wear
i too transported by the mode offend
and while i meant to praise thee must commend
thy verse created like thy theme sublime
in number weight and measure needs not rhime


fly envious time till thou run out thy race
call on the lazie leadenstepping howres
whose speed is but the heavie plummets pace
glut thy selfe wth what thy womb devoures
wch is no more then what is false vaine
meerly mortall drosse
so little is our losse
so little is thy gaine


for when as each thing bad thou hast entombd
last of all thy greedie selfe consumd
then long aeternity shall greet our blisse
wth an individuall kisse
and joy shall overtake us as a flood
when every thing yt is sincerely good
pfectly divine
with truth peace love shall ever shine
about the supreme throne
of him t whose happymaking sight alone
when once our heavnlyguided soule shall clime
then all this earthie grossnesse quit
attird wth starres wee shall for ever sit
triumphing over death chance thee o time


o nightingale that on yon bloomy spray
warblst at eeve when all the woods are still
thou with fresh hope the lovers heart dost fill
while the jolly hours lead on propitious may
thy liquid notes that close the eye of day
first heard before the shallow cuccoos bill
portend success in love o if joves will
have linkt that amorous power to thy soft lay
now timely sing ere the rude bird of hate
foretell my hopeles doom in som grove ny
as thou from yeer to yeer hast sung too late
for my relief yet hadst no reason why
whether the muse or love call thee his mate
both them i serve and of their train am i

wise men alway
affirm and say
that best tis for a man
diligently
for to apply
the business that he can


and in no wise
to enterprise
another faculty
for he that will
and can no skill
is never like to thrive


he that hath left
the hosiers craft
and falleth to making shone
the smith that shall
to painting fall
his thrift is wellnigh done


a black draper
with white paper
to go to writing school
an old butler
become a cutler
i ween shall prove a fool


and an old trot
that can god wot
nothing but kiss the cup
with her physic
will keep one sick
till she have soused him up


a man of law
that never saw
the ways to buy and sell
weening to rise
by merchandise
i pray god speed him well


a merchant eke
that will go seek
by all the means he may
to fall in suit
till he dispute
his money clean away


pleading the law
for every straw
shall prove a thrifty man
with bate and strife
but by my life
i cannot tell you whan


when an hatter
will go smatter
in philosophy
or a pedlar
were a meddler
in theology


all that ensue
such craftes new
they drive so far a cast
that evermore
they do therefore
beshrew themselves at last


this thing was tried
and verified
here by a serjeant late
that thriftly was
or he could pass
rapped about the pate


while that he would
see how he could
in gods name play the frere
now if you will
know how it fell
take heed and ye shall hear


it happed so
not long ago
a thrifty man there died
an hundred pound
of nobles round
that had he laid aside


his son he would
should have this gold
for to begin withal
but to suffice
this child well thrice
that money was too small


yet ere this day
i have heard say
that many a man certes
hath with good cast
be rich at last
that hath begun with less


but this young man
so well began
his money to employ
that certainly
his policy
to see it was a joy


for lest some blast
might overcast
his ship or by mischance
men with some wile
might him beguile
and minish his substance


for to put out
all manner doubt
he made a good purvey
for evry whit
by his own wit
and took another way


first fair and well
thereof much deal
he diggd it in a pot
but then he thought
that way was nought
and there he left it not


so was he fain
from thence again
to put it in a cup
and by and by
covetously
he supped it fairlyup


in his own breast
he thought it best
his money to inclose
then wist he well
whatever fell
he could it never lose


he borrowd then
of other men
money and merchandise
never paid it
up he laid it
in like manner wise


yet on the gear
that he would wear
he rought not what he spent
so it were nice
as for the price
could him not miscontent


with lusty sport
and with resort
of joly company
in mirth and play
full many a day
he lived merrily


and men had sworn
some man is born
to have a lucky hour
and so was he
for such degree
he gat and such honour


that without doubt
when he went out
a serjeant well and fair
was ready strait
on him to wait
as soon as on the mayr


but he doubtless
of his meekness
hated such pomp and pride
and would not go
companied so
but drew himself aside


to saint cathrine
strait as a line
he gat him at a tide
for devotion
or promotion
there would he needs abide


there spent he fast
till all was past
and to him came there many
to ask their debt
but none could get
the value of a penny


with visage stout
he bare it out
even unto the hard hedge
a month or twain
till he was fain
to lay his gown to pledge


then was he there
in greater fear
than ere that he came thither
and would as fain
depart again
but that he wist not whither


then after this
to a friend of his
he went and there abode
whereas he lay
so sick alway
he might not come abroad


it happed than
a merchant man
that he owd money to
of an officer
then gan enquire
what him was best to do


and he ansred
be not afraid
take an action therefore
i you behest
i shall him rest
and then care for no more


i fear quoth he
it will not be
for he will not come out
the sergeant said
be not afraid
it shall be brought about


in many a game
like to the same
have i been well in ure
and for your sake
let me be bake
but if i do this cure


thus part they both
and forth then goth
apace this officer
and for a day
all his array
he changed with a frere


so was he dight
that no man might
him for a frere deny
he doppd and dookd
he spake and lookd
so religiously


yet in a glass
ere he would pass
he toted and he peerd
his heart for pride
leapt in his side
to see how well he frerd


then forth apace
unto the place
he goeth in gods name
to do this deed
but now take heed
for here begins the game


he drew him nigh
and softily
straight at the door he knockd
and a damsel
that heard him well
there came and it unlockd


the friar said
god speed fair maid
here lodgeth such a man
it is told me
well sir quoth she
and if he do what than


quoth he mistress
no harm doubtless
it longeth for our order
to hurt no man
but as we can
every wight to farther


with him truly
fain speak would i
sir quoth she by my fai
he is so sick
ye be not like
to speak with him today


quoth he fair mai
yet i you pray
this much at my desire
vouchsafe to do
as go him to
and say an austin friar


would with him speak
and matters break
for his avail certain
quoth she i will
stand you here still
till i come down again


up did she go
and told him so
as she was bid to say
he mistrusting
no manner thing
said maiden go thy way


and fetch him hither
that we together
may talk adown she goth
up she him brought
no harm she thought
but it made some folk wroth


this officer
this feigned frere
when he was come aloft
he dopped than
and greet this man
religiously and oft


and he again
right glad and fain
took him there by the hand
the friar then said
you be dismayd
with trouble i understand


indeed quoth he
it hath with me
been better than it is
sir quoth the frere
be of good cheer
yet shall it after this


for christ his sake
look that you take
no thought within your breast
god may turn all
and so he shall
i trust unto the best


but i would now
commune with you
in counsel if you please
or elles not
of matters that
shall set your heart at ease


down went the maid
the merchant said
now sayon gentle frere
of this tiding
that you me bring
i long full sore to hear


when there was none
but they alone
the friar with evil grace
said i rest thee
come on with me
and out he took his mace


thou shalt obey
come on thy way
i have thee in my clutch
thou gost not hence
for all the pence
the mayr hath in his pouch


this merchant there
for wrath and fear
he waxingwell nigh wood
said whoreson thief
with a mischief
who hath taught thee thy good


and with his fist
upon the list
he gave him such a blow
that backward down
almost in swoon
the friar did overthrow


yet was this man
well fearder than
lest he the frir had slain
till with good raps
and heavy claps
he dawde him up again


the friar took heart
and up he start
and well he laid about
and so there goth
between them both
many a lusty clout


they rent and tear
each others hair
and clave together fast
till with lugging
and with tugging
they fell down both at last


then on the ground
together round
with many a sad stroke
they roll and rumble
they turn and tumble
as pigs do in a poke


so long above
they heave and shove
together that at last
the maid and wife
to break the strife
hied them upward fast


and when they spy
the captains lie
both weltring on the place
the friars hood
they pulld agood
adown about his face


while he was blind
the wench behind
lent him laid on the floor
many a joll
about the noul
with a great battledoor


the wife came yet
and with her feet
she holpe to keep him down
and with her rock
many a knock
she gave him on the crown


they laid his mace
about his face
that he was wood for pain
the friar frap
gat many a swap
till he was full nigh slain


up they him lift
and with ill thrift
headlong along the stair
down they him threw
and said adieu
commend us to the mayr


the friar arose
but i suppose
amazed was his head
he shook his ears
and from great fears
he thought him well afled


quoth he now lost
is all this cost
we be never the near
ill must he theeh
that caused me
to make myself a frere


now masters all
here now i shall
end there as i began
in anywise
i would advise
and counsel evry man


his own craft use
all new refuse
and lightly let them gone
play not the frere
now make good cheer
and welcome evry chone

in worldly joy and frail prosperity

without my favour there is nothyng wonne
many a matter have i brought at last
to good connclusion that fondly was begonne
and many a purpose bounden sure and fast
with wise provision i have overcast
without good happe there may no wit suffise
better is to be fortunate than wyse


and therefore hath there some men bene or this
my deadly foes and written many a boke
to my disprayse and other cause there nys
but for me list not frendly on them loke
thus lyke the fox they fare that once forsoke
the pleasaunt grapes and gan for to defy them
because he lept and yet could not come by them


but let them write theyr labour is in vayne
for well ye wote myrth honour and richesse
much better is than penury and payne
the nedy wretch that lingereth in distresse
without myne helpe is ever comfortlesse


i am called childhood in play is all my mind
to cast a quoit a cokstele and a ball
a top can i set and drive it in his kind
but would to god these hateful bookes all
were in a fire burnt to powder small
then might i lead my life always in play
which life god send me to mine ending day


manhood i am therefore i me delight
to hunt and hawk to nourishup and feed
the greyhound to the course the hawk to the flight
and to bestride a good and lusty steed
these things become a very man indeed
yet thinketh this boy his peevish game sweeter
but what no force his reason is no better


whoso na knoweth the strength power and might
of venus and me her little son cupid
thou manhood shalt a mirrour been aright
by us subdued for all thy great pride
my fiery dart pierceth thy tender side
now thou who erst dispisedst children small
shall wax a child again and be my thrall


old age am i with lockes thin and hoar
of our short life the last and best part
wise and discreet the public weal therefore
i help to rule to my labour and smart
therefore cupid withdraw thy fiery dart
chargeable matters shall of love oppress
thy childish game and idle business


though i be foul ugly lean and mishape
yet there is none in all this world wide
that may my power withstand or escape
therefore sage father greatly magnified
descend from your chair set apart your pride
vouchsafe to lend tho it be to your pain
to me a fool some of your wise brain


fame i am called marvel you nothing
though with tongues am compassed all round
for in voice of people is my chief living
o cruel death thy power i confound
when thou a noble man hast brought to ground
maugre thy teeth to live cause him shall i
of people in perpetual memory


i whom thou sees with horologe in hand
am named time the lord of every hour
i shall in space destroy both sea and land
o simple fame how darest thou man honour
promising of his name an endless flower
who may in the world have a name eternal
when i shall in process destroy the world and all


he needeth not to boast i am eternity
the very name signifieth well
and mine empire infinite shall be
thou mortal time every man can tell
art nothing else but the mobility
of sun and moon changing in every degree
when they shall leave their course thou shalt be brought
for all thy pride and boasting into nought


eyeflattering fortune look thou neer so fair
or neer so pleasantly begin to smile
as though thou wouldst my ruin all repair
during my life thou shalt not me beguile
trust shall i god to enter in erewhile
his haven of havens sure and uniform
after a calm i still expect the storm


long was i lady luck your servingman
and now have lost again all that i gat
when therefore i think of you now and then
and in my mind remember this and that
ye may not blame me though i shrew your cat
in faith i bless you and a thousand times
for lending me some leisure to make rhymes


the first point is to love but one alone
and for that one all others to forsake
for whoso loveth many loveth none
the flood that is in many channels take
in each of them shall feeble streams make
the love that is divided among many
uneath sufficeth that any part have any


so thou that hast thy love set unto god
in thy remembrance this imprint and grave
as he in sovereign dignity is odd
so will he in love no parting fellows have
love him therefore with all that he thee gave
for body soul wit cunning mind and thought
part will he none but either all or naught


of his love lo the sight and company
to the lover so glad and pleasant is
that whoso hath the grace to come thereby
he judgeth him in perfect joy and bliss
and whoso of that company doth miss
live he in never so prosperous estate
he thinketh him wretched and infortunate


so should the lover of god esteem that he
which all the pleasure hath mirth and disport
that in this world is possible to be
yet till the time that he may once resort
unto that blessed joyful heavenly port
where he of god may have the glorious sight
is void of perfect joy and sure delight


the third point of a perfect lover is
to make him fresh to see that all things been
appointed well and nothing set amiss
but all well fashioned proper goodly clean
that in his person there be nothing seen
in speech apparel gesture look or pace
that may offend or diminish any grace


so thou that wilt with god get into favor
garnish thyself up in as goodly wise
as comely be as honest in behaviour
as it is possible for thee to devise
i mean not hereby that thou shouldest arise
and in the glass upon thy body prowl
but with fair virtue to adorn thy soul


if love be strong hot mighty and fervent
there may no trouble grief or sorrow fall
but that the lover would be well content
all to endure and think it also too small
though it were death so he might therewithal
the joyful presence of that person get
on whom he hath his heart and love set


thus should of god the lover be content
any distress or sorrow to endure
rather than to be from god absent
and glad to die so that he may be sure
by his departing hence for to procure
after this valley dark the heavenly light
and of his love the glorious blessed sight


not only a lover content is in his heart
but coveteth also and longeth to sustain
some labor incommodity or smart
loss adversity trouble grief or pain
and of his sorrow joyful is and fain
and happy thinketh himself that he may take
some misadventure for his lovers sake


thus shouldest thou that lovest god also
in thine heart wish covet and be glad
for him to suffer trouble pain and woe
for whom if thou be never so woe bestead
yet thou ne shalt sustain be not adread
half the dolour grief and adversity
that he already suffered hath for thee


the perfect lover longeth for to be
in presence of his love both night and day
and if it haply so befall that he
may not as he would he will yet as he may
ever be with his love that is to say
where his heavy body will not be brought
he will be conversant in mind and thought


lo in like manner the lover of god should
at the least in such wise as he may
if he may not in such wise as he would
be present with god and conversant always
for certes whoso list he may purvey
though all the world would him therefrom bereaven
to bear his body in earth his mind in heaven


there is no page or servant most or least
that doth upon his love attend and wait
there is no little worm no simple beast
nor none so small a trifle or conceit
lace girdle point or proper glove strait
but that if to his love it has been near
the lover hath it precious lief and dear


so every relic image or picture
that doth pertain to gods magnificence
the lover of god should with all busy cure
have it in love honor and reverence
and specially give them preeminence
which daily done his blessed body wurche
the quick relics the ministers of his church


a very lover above all earthly things
coveteth and longeth evermore to hear
the honour laud commendation and praising
and everything that may the fame clear
of his love he may in no manner
endure to hear that therefrom mighten vary
or anything sound into the contrary


the lover of god should covet in likewise
to hear his honor worship laud and praise
whose sovereign goodness none heart may comprise
whom hell earth and all the heaven obeys
whose perfect lover ought by no manner ways
to suffer the cursed words of blasphemy
or anything spoken of god unreverently


a very lover believeth in his mind
on whomsoever he hath his heart bent
that in that person men may nothing find
but honorable worthy and excellent
and also surmounting far in his intent
all other that he hath known by sight or name
and would that every man should think the same


of god likewise so wonderful and high
all things esteem and judge his lover ought
so reverence worship honor and magnify
that all the creatures in this world wrought
in comparison should he set at nought
and glad be if he might the mean devise
that all the world would thinken in likewise


the lover is of color dead and pale
there will no sleep into his eyes stalk
he favoureth neither meat wine nor ale
he mindeth not what men about him talk
but eat he drink he sit lie down or walk
he burneth ever as it were with a fire
in the fervent heat of his desire


here should the lover of god example take
to have him continually in remembrance
with him in prayer and meditation wake
while others play revel sing and dance
none earthly joy disport or vain plesance
should him delight or anything remove
his ardent mind from god his heavenly love


diversely passioned is the lovers heart
now pleasant hope now dread and grievous fear
now perfect bliss now bitter sorrow smart
and whether his love be with him or elsewhere
oft from his eyes there falleth many a tear
for very joy when they together be
when they be sundered for adversity


like affections feeleth also the breast
of gods lover in prayer and meditation
when that his love liketh in him rest
with inward gladness of pleasant contemplation
out break the tears for joy and delectation
and when his love list eft to part him fro
out break the tears again for pain and woe


a very lover will his love obey
his joy it is and all his appetite
to pain himself in all that ever he may
that person in whom he set hath his delight
diligently to serve both day and night
for very love without any regard
to any profit guerdon or reward


so thou likewise that hast thine heart set
upward to god so well thyself endeavor
so studiously that nothing may thee let
not for his service any wise dissever
freely look also that thou serve thereto never
trust of reward or profit do thee bind
but only faithful heart and loving mind


wageless to serve three things may us move
first if the service self be desirable
second if they whom that we serve and love
be very good and very amiable
thirdly of reason be we serviceable
without the gaping after any more
to such as have done much for us before


serve god for love then not for hope of meed
what service may so desirable be
as where all turneth to thine own speed
who is so good so lovely also as he
who hath already done so much for thee
as he that first thee made and on the rood
eft thee redeemèd with his precious blood


o holy god of dreadful majesty
verily one in three and three in one
whom angels serve whose work all creatures be
which heaven and earth directest all alone
we thee beseech good lord with woeful moan
spare us wretches and wash away our guilt
that we be not by thy just anger spilt


in strait balance of rigorous judgment
if thou shouldst our sin ponder and weigh
who able were to bear thy punishment
the whole engine of all this world i say
the engine that enduren shall for aye
with such examination might not stand
space of a moment in thine angry hand


who is not born in sin original
who doth not actually sin in sundry wise
but thou good lord art he that sparest all
with piteous mercy tempering justice
for as thou dost reward us device
about our merit so dost thou dispense
thy punishment far under our offence


more is thy mercy far than all our sin
to give them also that unworthy be
more godly is and more mercy therein
howbeit worthy enough are they pardee
be they never so unworthy whom that he
chooses to accept which where so ever he taketh
whom he unworthy findeth worthy maketh


wherefore good lord that always merciful art
unto thy grace and sovereign dignity
we silly wretches cry with humble heart
our sin forgot and our malignity
with piteous yes of thy benignity
friendly look on us once thine own we be
servants or sinners whether it liketh thee


sinners if thou our crime behold certain
our crime the work of our uncourteous mind
but if thy gifts thou behold again
thy gifts noble wonderful and kind
thou shalt us then the same persons find
which are to thee and have be long space
servants by nature children by thy grace


but this thy goodness wringeth us alas
for we whom grace had made thee children dear
are made thy guilty folk by our trespass
sin hath us guilty made this many a year
but let thy grace thy grace that hath no peer
of our offence surmount all the preace
that in our sin thine honor may increase


for thou thy wisdom though thy sovereign power
may otherwise appear sufficiently
as things which thy creatures every hour
all with one voice declare and testify
thy goodness yet thy singular mercy
thy piteous heart thy gracious indulgence
no thing so clearly showeth as our offence


what but our sin hath showed that mighty love
which able was thy dreadful majesty
to draw down into earth from heaven above
and crucify god that we poor wretches we
should from our filthy sin cleansed be
with blood and water of thine own side
that streamed from thy blessed wounds wide


thy love and pity thus o heavenly king
our evil maketh matter of thy goodness
o love o pity our wealth ay providing
o goodness serving thy servants in distress
o love o pity well nigh now thankless
o goodness mighty gracious and wise
and yet almost now vanquished with our vice


grant i thee pray such heat into mine heart
that to this love of thine may be egall
grant me from sathanas service to astart
with whom me rueth so long to have be thrall
grant me good lord and creator of all
the flame to quench of all sinful desire
and in thy love set all mine heart afire


that when the journey of this deadly life
my silly ghost hath finished and thence
departed must without his fleshly wife
alone into his lords high presence
he may thee find o well of indulgence
in thy lordship not as a lord but rather
as a very tender loving father


whoso to virtue esteems hard the way
because we must have war continual
against the world the flesh the devil that ave
enforce themselves to make us bond and thrall
let him remember that choose what may he shall
even after the world yet must he need sustain
sorrow adversity labor grief and pain


think in this wretched worlds busy woe
the battle more sharp and longer is i wis
with more labor and less fruit also
in which the end of labor labor is
and when the world hath left us after this
void of all virtue the reward when we die
is nought but fire and pain perpetually


consider well that folly it is and vain
to look for heaven with pleasure and delight
since christ our lord and sovereign captain
ascended never but by manly fight
and bitter passion then were it no right
that any servant ye will yourself record
should stand in better condition than his lord


think how that we not only should not grudge
but also be glad and joyful of this fight
and long thereforealthough we could not judge
how that thereby redound unto us might
any profit but only for delight
to be conformed and like in some behavior
to jesu christ our blessed lord and savoir


as often as thou dost war and strive
by the resistance of any sinful motion
against any of thy sensual wits five
cast in thy mind as oft with good devotion
how thou resemblest christ as with sour potion
if thou pain thy taste remember therewithal
how christ for thee tasted eysell and gall


if thou withdraw thine hands and forbear
the ravishing of anything remember then
how his innocent hands nailed were
if thou be tempt with pride think how that when
he was in form of god yet of a bondman
he took the shape and humbled himself for thee
to the most odious and vile death of a tree


consider when thou art moved to be wroth
he who that was god and of all men the best
seeing himself scorned and scourged both
and as a thief between two thieves thrests
with all rebuke and shame yet from his breast
came never sign of wrath or of disdain
but patiently endured all the pain


thus every snare and engine of the devil
if thou this wise peruse them by and by
there can be none so cursed or so evil
but to some virtue thou mayst it apply
for oft thou shalt resisting valiantly
the fiends might and subtle fiery dart
our savior christ resemble in some part


remember well that we in no wise must
neither in the foresaid spiritual armor
nor any other remedy put our trust
but only in the virtue of our savior
for he it is by whose mighty power
the world was vanquished and its prince cast out
which reigned before in all the earth about


in him let us trust to overcome all evil
in him let us put our hope and confidence
to subdue the flesh and master the devil
to him be all honor and lowly reverence
oft should we require with all our diligence
with prayer with tears and lamentable plaints
the aid of his grace and his holy saints


one sin vanquished look thou not tarry
but lie in await for another very hour
for as a wood lion the fiend our adversary
runneth about seeking whom he may devour
wherefore continually upon thy tower
lest he thee unpurveyed and unready catch
thou must with the prophet stand and keep watch


enforce thyself not only for to stand
unvanquished against the devils might
but over that take valiantly on hand
to vanquish him and put him unto flight
and that is when of the same deed thought or sight
by which he would have thee with sin contract
thou takest occasion of some good virtuous act


sometime he secretly casteth in thy mind
some laudable deed to stir thee to pride
as vainglory maketh many a man blind
but let humility be thy sure guide
thy good work to god let it be applied
think it not thine but a gift of his
of whose grace undoubtedly all goodness is


in time of battle so put thyself in preace
as though thou shouldest after that victory
enjoy forever a perpetual peace
for god of his goodness and liberal mercy
may grant the gift and also thy proud enemy
confounded and rebuked by thy battle
shall thee no more haply for very shame assail


but when thou mayest once the triumph obtain
prepare thyself and trim thee in thy gear
as thou shouldest incontinent fight again
for if thou be ready the devil will thee fear
wherefore in any wise so even thou thee bear
that thou remember and have ever in memory
in victory battle in battle victory


if thou think thyself well fenced and sure
against every subtle suggestion of vice
consider frail glass may no distress endure
and great adventurers often curse the dice
jeopard not too far therefore and ye be wise
but evermore eschew the occasions of sin
for he that loveth peril shall perish therein


in all temptation withstand the beginning
the cursed infants of wretched babylon
to suffer them wax is a jeopardous thing
beat out their brains therefore at the stone
perilous is the canker that catcheth the bone
too late cometh the medicine if thou let the sore
by long continuance increase more and more


though in the time of the battle and war
the conflict seem bitter sharp and sour
yet consider it is more pleasure far
over the devil to be a conqueror
than is in the use of thy beastly pleasure
of virtue more joy the conscience hath within
than outward the body of all his filthy sin


in this point many men err for negligence
for they compare not the joy of the victory
to the sensual pleasure of their concupiscence
but like rude beasts unadvisedly
lacking discretion they compare and apply
of their foul sin the voluptuous delight
to the laborious travail of the conflict and fight


and yet alas he that oft hath known
what grief it is by long experience
of his cruel enemy to be overthrown
should once at the leastwise do his diligence
to prove and essay with manly defense
what pleasure there is what honor peace and rest
in glorious victory triumph and conquest


though thou be tempted despair thee nothing
remember the glorious apostle saint paul
when he had seen god in his perfect being
lest such revelation should his heart extol
his flesh was suffered to rebel against his soul
this did almighty god of his goodness provide
to preserve his servant from the danger of pride


and here take heed that he whom god did love
and for his most especial vessel chose
ravished into the third heaven above
yet stood in peril lest pride might him depose
well ought we then our hearts fence and close
against vainglory the mother of reprief
the very crop and root of all mischief


against this pomp and wretched worlds gloss
consider how christ the lord sovereign power
humbled himself for us unto the cross
and peradventure death within one hour
shall us bereave wealth riches and honor
and bring us down full low both small and great
to vile carrion and wretched worms meat


consider well the pleasure that thou hast
stand it in touching or in wanton sight
in vain smell or in thy licorous taste
or finally in whatsoever delight
occupied is thy wretched appetite
thou shalt it find when thou hast all cast
little simple short and suddenly past


any good work if thou with labor do
the labor goeth the goodness doth remain
if thou do evil with pleasure joined thereto
the pleasure which thine evil work doth contain
glideth his way thou must him not restrain
the evil then in thy breast cleaveth behind
with grudge of heart and heaviness of mind


when thou laborest thy pleasure for to buy
upon the price look thou well thee advise
thou sellest thy soul therefore even by and by
to thy most utter despiteous enemies
o mad merchant o foolish merchandise
to buy a trifle o childish reckoning
and pay therefore so dear a precious thing


this wretched life the trust and confidence
of whose continuance maketh us bold to sin
thou perceivest well by experience
since that hour in which it did begin
it holdeth on the course and will not lin
but fast it runneth on and passen shall
as doth a dream or shadow on the wall


consider well that ever night and day
while that we busily provide and care
for our disport revel mirth and play
for pleasant melody and dainty fare
death stealeth on full slyly and unaware
he lieth at hand and shall us enterprise
we know not how soon nor in what manner wise


if thou shouldst god offend think how therefore
thou were forthwith in very jeopardous case
for haply thou shouldst not live an hour more
thy sin to cleanse and though thou haddest space
yet peradventure shouldst thou lack the grace
well ought we then be feared to do offence
impenitent lest we departen hence


thou seest this world is but a thoroughfare
see thou behave thee wisely with thine host
hence must thou needs depart naked and bare
and after thy desert look to what cost
thou art conveyed at such time as thy ghost
from this wretched carcass shall dissever
be it joy or pain endure it shall forever


remember how god hath made thee reasonable
like unto his image and figure
and for thee suffered pains intolerable
that he for an angel never would endure
regard o man thine excellent nature
thou that with angels art made to be equal
for very shame be not the devils thrall


why lovest thou so this brittle worlds joy
take all the mirth take all the fantasies
take every game take every wanton toy
take every sport that men can thee devise
and among them all on warrantise
thou shalt no pleasure comparable find
to th inward gladness of a virtuous mind


beside that god thee bought and formed both
many a benefit hast thou received of his
though thou have moved him often to be wroth
yet he thee kept hath and brought thee up to this
and daily calleth upon thee to his bliss
how mayst thou then to him unloving be
that ever hath been so loving unto thee


when thou in flame of the temptation friest
think on the very lamentable pain
think on the piteous cross of woeful christ
think on his blood beat out at every vein
think on his precious heart carved in twain
think how for thy redemption all was wrought
let him not lose thee that he so dear hath bought


sin to withstand say not thou lackest might
such allegations folly it is to use
the witness of saints and martyrs constant sight
shall thee of slothful cowardice accuse
god will thee help if thou do not refuse
if other have stood or this thou mayst eftsoon
nothing impossible is that hath been done


what dire offence from amorous causes springs
what mighty contests rise from trivial things
i singthis verse to caryl muse is due
this evn belinda may vouchsafe to view
slight is the subject but not so the praise
if she inspire and he approve my lays


say what strange motive goddess could compel
a wellbred lord t assault a gentle belle
o say what stranger cause yet unexplored
could make a gentle belle reject a lord
in tasks so bold can little men engage
and in soft bosoms dwells such mighty rage


sol thro white curtains shot a timorous ray
and oped those eyes that must eclipse the day
now lapdogs give themselves the rousing shake
and sleepless lovers just at twelve awake
thrice rung the bell the slipper knockd the ground
and the pressd watch returnd a silver sound
belinda still her downy pillow prest
her guardian sylph prolongd the balmy rest
twas he had summond to her silent bed
the morningdream that hoverd oer her head
a youth more glittring than a birthnight beau
that evn in slumber causd her cheek to glow
seemd to her ear his winning lips to lay
and thus in whispers said or seemd to say


fairest of mortals thou distinguishd care
of thousand bright inhabitants of air
if eer one vision touchd thy infant thought
of all the nurse and all the priest have taught
of airy elves by moonlight shadows seen
the silver token and the circled green
or virgins visited by angelpowrs
with golden crowns and wreaths of heavnly flowrs
hear and believe thy own importance know
nor bound thy narrow views to things below
some secret truths from learned pride conceald
to maids alone and children are reveald
what tho no credit doubting wits may give
the fair and innocent shall still believe
know then unnumberd spirits round thee fly
the light militia of the lower sky
these tho unseen are ever on the wing
hang oer the box and hover round the ring
think what an equipage thou hast in air
and view with scorn two pages and a chair
as now your own our beings were of old
and once inclosd in womans beauteous mould
thence by a soft transition we repair
from earthly vehicles to these of air
think not when womans transient breath is fled
that all her vanities at once are dead
succeeding vanities she still regards
and tho she plays no more oerlooks the cards
her joy in gilded chariots when alive
and love of ombre after death survive
for when the fair in all their pride expire
to their first elements their souls retire
the sprites of fiery termagants in flame
mount up and take a salamanders name
soft yielding minds to water glide away
and sip with nymphs their elemental tea
the graver prude sinks downward to a gnome
in search of mischief still on earth to roam
the light coquettes in sylphs aloft repair
and sport and flutter in the fields of air


know further yet whoever fair and chaste
rejects mankind is by some sylph embracd
for spirits freed from mortal laws with ease
assume what sexes and what shapes they please
what guards the purity of melting maids
in courtly balls and midnight masquerades
safe from the treachrous friend the daring spark
the glance by day the whisper in the dark
when kind occasion prompts their warm desires
when music softens and when dancing fires
tis but their sylph the wise celestials know
tho honour is the word with men below


some nymphs there are too conscious of their face
for life predestind to the gnomes embrace
these swell their prospects and exalt their pride
when offers are disdaind and love denyd
then gay ideas crowd the vacant brain
while peers and dukes and all their sweeping train
and garters stars and coronets appear
and in soft sounds your grace salutes their ear
t is these that early taint the female soul
instruct the eyes of young coquettes to roll
teach infantcheeks a bidden blush to know
and little hearts to flutter at a beau


oft when the world imagine women stray
the sylphs thro mystic mazes guide their way
thro all the giddy circle they pursue
and old impertinence expel by new
what tender maid but must a victim fall
to one mans treat but for anothers ball
when florio speaks what virgin could withstand
if gentle damon did not squeeze her hand
with varying vanities from evry part
they shift the moving toyshop of their heart
where wigs with wigs with swordknots swordknots strive
beaux banish beaux and coaches coaches drive
this erring mortals levity may call
oh blind to truth the sylphs contrive it all


of these am i who thy protection claim
a watchful sprite and ariel is my name
late as i rangd the crystal wilds of air
in the clear mirror of thy ruling star
i saw alas some dread event impend
ere to the main this morning sun descend
but heavn reveals not what or how or where
warnd by the sylph oh pious maid beware
this to disclose is all thy guardian can
beware of all but most beware of man


he said when shock who thought she slept too long
leapd up and wakd his mistress with his tongue
t was then belinda if report say true
thy eyes first opend on a billetdoux
wounds charms and ardors were no sooner read
but all the vision vanishd from thy head


and now unveild the toilet stands displayd
each silver vase in mystic order laid
first robd in white the nymph intent adores
with head uncoverd the cosmetic powrs


a heavnly image in the glass appears
to that she bends to that her eyes she rears
th inferior priestess at her altars side
trembling begins the sacred rites of pride
unnumberd treasures ope at once and here
the various offrings of the world appear
from each she nicely culls with curious toil
and decks the goddess with the glittring spoil


this casket indias glowing gems unlocks
and all arabia breathes from yonder box
the tortoise here and elephant unite
transformed to combs the speckled and the white
here files of pins extend their shining rows
puffs powders patches bibles billetdoux


now awful beauty puts on all its arms
the fair each moment rises in her charms
repairs her smiles awakens evry grace
and calls forth all the wonders of her face
sees by degrees a purer blush arise
and keener lightnings quicken in her eyes
the busy sylphs surround their darling care
these set the head and those divide the hair
some fold the sleeve whilst others plait the gown
and bettys praisd for labours not her own


not with more glories in th etherial plain
the sun first rises oer the purpled main
than issuing forth the rival of his beams
launchd on the bosom of the silver thames
fair nymphs and welldrest youths around her shone
but evry eye was fixd on her alone
on her white breast a sparkling cross she wore
which jews might kiss and infidels adore
her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose
quick as her eyes and as unfixd as those
favours to none to all she smiles extends
oft she rejects but never once offends
bright as the sun her eyes the gazers strike
and like the sun they shine on all alike
yet graceful ease and sweetness void of pride
might hide her faults if belles had faults to hide
if to her share some female errors fall
look on her face and youll forget em all


this nymph to the destruction of mankind
nourishd two locks which graceful hung behind
in equal curls and well conspird to deck
with shining ringlets the smooth ivry neck
love in these labyrinths his slaves detains
and mighty hearts are held in slender chains
with hairy springes we the birds betray
slight lines of hair surprise the finny prey
fair tresses mans imperial race ensnare
and beauty draws us with a single hair


th adventrous baron the bright locks admird
he saw he wishd and to the prize aspird
resolvd to win he meditates the way
by force to ravish or by fraud betray
for when success a lovers toil attends
few ask if fraud or force attaind his ends


for this ere phoebus rose he had implord
propitious heavn and evry powr adord
but chiefly loveto love an altar built
of twelve vast french romances neatly gilt
there lay three garters half a pair of gloves
and all the trophies of his former loves
with tender billetdoux he lights the pyre
and breathes three amrous sighs to raise the fire
then prostrate falls and begs with ardent eyes
soon to obtain and long possess the prize
the powrs gave ear and granted half his prayr
the rest the winds dispersd in empty air


but now secure the painted vessel glides
the sunbeams trembling on the floating tides
while melting music steals upon the sky
and softend sounds along the waters die
smooth flow the waves the zephyrs gently play
belinda smild and all the world was gay
all but the sylphwith careful thoughts opprest
th impending woe sat heavy on his breast
he summons strait his denizens of air
the lucid squadrons round the sails repair
soft oer the shrouds aerial whispers breathe
that seemd but zephyrs to the train beneath
some to the sun their insectwings unfold
waft on the breeze or sink in clouds of gold
transparent forms too fine for mortal sight
their fluid bodies half dissolvd in light
loose to the wind their airy garments flew
thin glittring textures of the filmy dew
dipt in the richest tincture of the skies
where light disports in evermingling dyes
while evry beam new transient colours flings
colours that change wheneer they wave their wings
amid the circle on the gilded mast
superior by the head was ariel placd
his purple pinions opning to the sun
he raisd his azure wand and thus begun


ye sylphs and sylphids to your chief give ear
fays fairies genii elves and daemons hear
ye know the spheres and various tasks assignd
by laws eternal to th aerial kind
some in the fields of purest aether play
and bask and whiten in the blaze of day
some guide the course of wandring orbs on high
or roll the planets thro the boundless sky
some less refind beneath the moons pale light
pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night
or suck the mists in grosser air below
or dip their pinions in the painted bow
or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main
or oer the glebe distil the kindly rain
others on earth oer human race preside
watch all their ways and all their actions guide
of these the chief the care of nations own
and guard with arms divine the british throne


our humbler province is to tend the fair
not a less pleasing tho less glorious care
to save the powder from too rude a gale
nor let th imprisondessences exhale
to draw fresh colours from the vernal flowrs
to steal from rainbows eer they drop in showrs
a brighter wash to curl their waving hairs
assist their blushes and inspire their airs
nay oft in dreams invention we bestow
to change a flounce or add a furbelow


this day black omens threat the brightest fair
that eer deservd a watchful spirits care
some dire disaster or by force or slight
but what or where the fates have wrapt in night
whether the nymph shall break dianas law
or some frail china jar receive a flaw
or stain her honour or her new brocade
forget her prayrs or miss a masquerade
or lose her heart or necklace at a ball
or whether heavn has doomd that shock must fall
haste then ye spirits to your charge repair
the fluttring fan be zephyrettas care
the drops to thee brillante we consign
and momentilla let the watch be thine
do thou crispissa tend her favrite lock
ariel himself shall be the guard of shock


to fifty chosen sylphs of special note
we trust th important charge the petticoat
oft have we known that sevenfold fence to fail
tho stiff with hoops and armd with ribs of whale
form a strong line about the silver bound
and guard the wide circumference around


whatever spirit careless of his charge
his post neglects or leaves the fair at large
shall feel sharp vengeance soon oertake his sins
be stoppd in vials or transfixd with pins
or plungd in lakes of bitter washes lie
or wedgd whole ages in a bodkins eye
gums and pomatums shall his flight restrain
while cloggd he beats his silken wings in vain
or alum styptics with contracting powr
shrink his thin essence like a riveld flowr
or as ixion fixd the wretch shall feel
the giddy motion of the whirling mill
in fumes of burning chocolate shall glow
and tremble at the sea that froths below


he spoke the spirits from the sails descend
some orb in orb around the nymph extend
some thrid the mazy ringlets of her hair
some hang upon the pendants of her ear
with beating hearts the dire event they wait
anxious and trembling for the birth of fate


close by those meads for ever crownd with flowrs
where thames with pride surveys his rising towrs
there stands a structure of majestic frame
which from the neighbring hampton takes its name
here britains statesmen oft the fall foredoom
of foreign tyrants and of nymphs at home
here thou great anna whom three realms obey
dost sometimes counsel takeand sometimes tea


hither the heroes and the nymphs resort
to taste awhile the pleasures of a court
in various talk th instructive hours they past
who gave the ball or paid the visit last
one speaks the glory of the british queen
and one describes a charming indian screen
a third interprets motions looks and eyes
at evry word a reputation dies
snuff or the fan supply each pause of chat
with singing laughing ogling and _all that_


mean while declining from the noon of day
the sun obliquely shoots his burning ray
the hungry judges soon the sentence sign
and wretches hang that jurymen may dine
the merchant from th exchange returns in peace
and the long labours of the toilet cease
belinda now whom thirst of fame invites
burns to encounter two adventrous knights
at ombre singly to decide their doom
and swells her breast with conquests yet to come
straight the three bands prepare in arms to join
each band the number of the sacred nine


soon as she spreads her hand th aerial guard
descend and sit on each important card
first ariel perchd upon a matadore
then each according to the rank they bore
for sylphs yet mindful of their ancient race
are as when women wondrous fond of place
behold four kings in majesty reverd
with hoary whiskers and a forky beard
and four fair queens whose hands sustain a flowr
th expressive emblem of their softer powr
four knaves in garbs succinct a trusty band
caps on their heads and halberts in their hand
and particolourd troops a shining train
draw forth to combat on the velvet plain


the skilful nymph reviews her force with care
let spades be trumps she said and trumps they were


now move to war her sable matadores
in show like leaders of the swarthy moors
spadillio first unconquerable lord
led off two captive trumps and swept the board
as many more manillio forcd to yield
and marchd a victor from the verdant field
him basto followd but his fate more hard
gaind but one trump and one plebeian card
with his broad sabre next a chief in years
the hoary majesty of spades appears
puts forth one manly leg to sight reveald
the rest his manycolourd robe conceald
the rebel knave who dares his prince engage
proves the just victim of his royal rage
evn mighty pam that kings and queens oerthrew
and mowd down armies in the fights of lu
sad chance of war now destitute of aid
falls undistinguishd by the victor spade


thus far both armies to belinda yield
now to the baron fate inclines the field
his warlike amazon her host invades
th imperial consort of the crown of spades
the clubs black tyrant first her victim dyd
spite of his haughty mien and barbrous pride
what boots the regal circle on his head
his giant limbs in state unwieldy spread
that long behind he trails his pompous robe
and of all monarchs only grasps the globe


the baron now his diamonds pours apace
th embroiderd king who shows but half his face
and his refulgent queen with powrs combind
of broken troops an easy conquest find
clubs diamonds hearts in wild disorder seen
with throngs promiscuous strow the level green
thus when dispersd a routed army runs
of asias troops and africs sable sons
with like confusion different nations fly
of various habit and of various dye
the piercd battalions disunited fall
in heaps on heaps one fate oerwhelms them all


the knave of diamonds tries his wily arts
and wins oh shameful chance the queen of hearts
at this the blood the virgins cheek forsook
a livid paleness spreads oer all her look
she sees and trembles at th approaching ill
just in the jaws of ruin and codille
and now as oft in some distemperd state
on one nice trick depends the genral fate
an ace of hearts steps forth the king unseen
lurkd in her hand and mournd his captive queen
he springs to vengeance with an eager pace
and falls like thunder on the prostrate ace
the nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky
the walls the woods and long canals reply


oh thoughtless mortals ever blind to fate
too soon dejected and too soon elate
sudden these honours shall be snatchd away
and cursd for ever this victorious day


for lo the board with cups and spoons is crownd
the berries crackle and the mill turns round
on shining altars of japan they raise
the silver lamp the fiery spirits blaze
from silver spouts the grateful liquors glide
while chinas earth receives the smoking tide
at once they gratify their scent and taste
and frequent cups prolong the rich repast
straight hover round the fair her airy band
some as she sippd the fuming liquor fannd
some oer her lap their careful plumes displayd
trembling and conscious of the rich brocade
coffee which makes the politician wise
and see thro all things with his halfshut eyes
sent up in vapours to the barons brain
new stratagems the radiant lock to gain
ah cease rash youth desist eret is too late
fear the just gods and think of scyllas fate
changd to a bird and sent to flit in air
she dearly pays for nisus injurd hair


but when to mischief mortals bend their will
how soon they find fit instruments of ill
just then clarissa drew with tempting grace
a twoedgd weapon from her shining case
so ladies in romance assist their knight
present the spear and arm him for the fight
he takes the gift with revrence and extends
the little engine on his fingers ends
this just behind belindas neck he spread
as oer the fragrant steams she bends her head
swift to the lock a thousand sprites repair
a thousand wings by turns blow back the hair
and thrice they twitchd the diamond in her ear
thrice she lookd back and thrice the foe drew near
just in that instant anxious ariel sought
the close recesses of the virgins thought
as on the nosegay in her breast reclind
he watchd th ideas rising in her mind
sudden he viewd in spite of all her art
an earthly lover lurking at her heart
amazd confusd he found his powr expird
resignd to fate and with a sigh retird


the peer now spreads the glittring forfex wide
t inclose the lock now joins it to divide
evn then before the fatal engine closd
a wretched sylph too fondly interposd
fate urgd the shears and cut the sylph in twain
but airy substance soon unites again
the meeting points the sacred hair dissever
from the fair head for ever and for ever


then flashd the living lightning from her eyes
and screams of horror rend th affrighted skies
not louder shrieks to pitying heavn are cast
when husbands or when lapdogs breathe their last
or when rich china vessels falln from high
in glittring dust and painted fragments lie


let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine
the victor cryd the glorious prize is mine
while fish in streams or birds delight in air
or in a coach and six the british fair
as long as atalantis shall be read
or the small pillow grace a ladys bed
while visits shall be paid on solemn days
when numrous waxlights in bright order blaze
while nymphs take treats or assignations give
so long my honour name and praise shall live
what time would spare from steel receives its date
and monuments like men submit to fate
steel could the labour of the gods destroy
and strike to dust th imperial towrs of troy
steel could the works of mortal pride confound
and hew triumphal arches to the ground
what wonder then fair nymph thy hairs should feel
the conquring force of unresisted steel


but anxious cares the pensive nymph oppressd
and secret passions labourd in her breast
not youthful kings in battle seizd alive
not scornful virgins who their charms survive
not ardent lovers robbd of all their bliss
not ancient ladies when refusd a kiss
not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die
not cynthia when her manteaus pinnd awry
eer felt such rage resentment and despair
as thou sad virgin for thy ravishd hair


for that sad moment when the sylphs withdrew
and ariel weeping from belinda flew
umbriel a dusky melancholy sprite
as ever sullyd the fair face of light
down to the central earth his proper scene
repaird to search the gloomy cave of spleen


swift on his sooty pinions flits the gnome
and in a vapour reachd the dismal dome
no cheerful breeze this sullen region knows
the dreaded east is all the wind that blows
here in a grotto shelterd close from air
and screend in shades from days detested glare
she sighs for ever on her pensive bed
pain at her side and megrim at her head


two handmaids wait the throne alike in place
but diffring far in figure and in face
here stood illnature like an ancient maid
her wrinkled form in black and white arrayd
with store of prayrs for mornings nights and noons
her hand is filld her bosom with lampoons


there affectation with a sickly mien
shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen
practisd to lisp and hang the head aside
faints into airs and languishes with pride
on the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe
wrapt in a gown for sickness and for show
the fair ones feel such maladies as these
when each new nightdress gives a new disease


a constant vapour oer the palace flies
strange phantoms rising as the mists arise
dreadful as hermits dreams in haunted shades
or bright as visions of expiring maids
now glaring fiends and snakes on rolling spires
pale spectres gaping tombs and purple fires
now lakes of liquid gold elysian scenes
and crystal domes and angels in machines


unnumberd throngs on every side are seen
of bodies changd to various forms by spleen
here living teapots stand one arm held out
one bent the handle this and that the spout
a pipkin there like homers tripod walks
here sighs a jar and there a goosepie talks
men prove with child as powrful fancy works
and maids turnd bottles call aloud for corks


safe past the gnome thro this fantastic band
a branch of healing spleenwort in his hand
then thus addressd the powr hail wayward queen
who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen
parent of vapours and of female wit
who give th hysteric or poetic fit
on various tempers act by various ways
make some take physic others scribble plays
who cause the proud their visits to delay
and send the godly in a pet to pray
a nymph there is that all thy powr disdains
and thousands more in equal mirth maintains
but oh if eer thy gnome could spoil a grace
or raise a pimple on a beauteous face
like citronwaters matrons cheeks inflame
or change complexions at a losing game
if eer with airy horns i planted heads
or rumpled petticoats or tumbled beds
or causd suspicion when no soul was rude
or discomposd the headdress of a prude
or eer to costive lapdog gave disease
which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease
hear me and touch belinda with chagrin
that single act gives half the world the spleen


the goddess with a discontented air
seems to reject him tho she grants his prayr
a wondrous bag with both her hands she binds
like that where once ulysses held the winds
there she collects the force of female lungs
sighs sobs and passions and the war of tongues
a vial next she fills with fainting fears
soft sorrows melting griefs and flowing tears
the gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away
spreads his black wings and slowly mounts to day


sunk in thalestris arms the nymph he found
her eyes dejected and her hair unbound
full oer their heads the swelling bag he rent
and all the furies issud at the vent
belinda burns with more than mortal ire
and fierce thalestris fans the rising fire
o wretched maid she spread her hands and cryd
while hamptons echoes wretched maid replyd
was it for this you took such constant care
the bodkin comb and essence to prepare
for this your locks in paper durance bound
for this with tortring irons wreathd around
for this with fillets straind your tender head
and bravely bore the double loads of lead
gods shall the ravisher display your hair
while the fops envy and the ladies stare
honour forbid at whose unrivalld shrine
ease pleasure virtue all our sex resign
methinks already i your tears survey
already hear the horrid things they say
already see you a degraded toast
and all your honour in a whisper lost
how shall i then your helpless fame defend
t will then be infamy to seem your friend
and shall this prize th inestimable prize
exposd thro crystal to the gazing eyes
and heightend by the diamonds circling rays
on that rapacious hand for ever blaze
sooner shall grass in hydepark circus grow
and wits take lodgings in the sound of bow
sooner let earth air sea to chaos fall
men monkeys lapdogs parrots perish all


she said then raging to sir plume repairs
and bids her beau demand the precious hairs
sir plume of amber snuffbox justly vain
and the nice conduct of a clouded cane
with earnest eyes and round unthinking face
he first the snuffbox opend then the case
and thus broke outmy lord why what the devil
zds damn the lock fore gad you must be civil
plague ontt is past a jestnay prithee pox
give her the hairhe spoke and rappd his box


it grieves me much replyd the peer again
who speaks so well should ever speak in vain
but by this lock this sacred lock i swear
which never more shall join its parted hair
which never more its honours shall renew
clippd from the lovely head where late it grew
that while my nostrils draw the vital air
this hand which won it shall for ever wear
he spoke and speaking in proud triumph spread
the longcontended honours of her head


but umbriel hateful gnome forbears not so
he breaks the vial whence the sorrows flow
then see the nymph in beauteous grief appears
her eyes halflanguishing halfdrownd in tears
on her heavd bosom hung her drooping head
which with a sigh she raisd and thus she said
for ever cursd be this detested day
which snatchd my best my favrite curl away
happy ah ten times happy had i been
if hamptoncourt these eyes had never seen
yet am not i the first mistaken maid
by love of courts to numrous ills betrayd
oh had i rather unadmird remaind
in some lone isle or distant northern land
where the gilt chariot never marks the way
where none learn ombre none eer taste bohea
there kept my charms conceald from mortal eye
like roses that in deserts bloom and die
what movd my mind with youthful lords to roam
oh had i stayd and said my prayrs at home
t was this the morning omens seemd to tell
thrice from my trembling hand the patchbox fell
the tottring china shook without a wind
nay poll sat mute and shock was most unkind
a sylph too warnd me of the threats of fate
in mystic visions now believd too late
see the poor remnants of these slighted hairs
my hands shall rend what evn thy rapine spares
these in two sable ringlets taught to break
once gave new beauties to the snowy neck
the sisterlock now sits uncouth alone
and in its fellows fate foresees its own
uncurld it hangs the fatal shears demands
and tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands
oh hadst thou cruel been content to seize
hairs less in sight or any hairs but these


she said the pitying audience melt in tears
but fate and jove had stoppd the barons ears
in vain thalestris with reproach assails
for who can move when fair belinda fails
not half so fixd the trojan could remain
while anna beggd and dido ragd in vain
then grave clarissa graceful wavd her fan
silence ensud and thus the nymph began


say why are beauties praisd and honourd most
the wise mans passion and the vain mans toast
why deckd with all that land and sea afford
why angels calld and angellike adord
why round our coaches crowd the whiteglovd beaux
why bows the sidebox from its inmost rows
how vain are all these glories all our pains
unless good sense preserve what beauty gains
that men may say when we the frontbox grace
behold the first in virtue as in face
oh if to dance all night and dress all day
charmd the smallpox or chasd oldage away
who would not scorn what housewifes cares produce
or who would learn one earthly thing of use
to patch nay ogle might become a saint
nor could it sure be such a sin to paint
but since alas frail beauty must decay
curld or uncurld since locks will turn to grey
since painted or not painted all shall fade
and she who scorns a man must die a maid
what then remains but well our powr to use
and keep goodhumour still whateer we lose
and trust me dear goodhumour can prevail
when airs and flights and screams and scolding fail
beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll
charms strike the sight but merit wins the soul


so spoke the dame but no applause ensud
belinda frownd thalestris calld her prude
to arms to arms the fierce virago cries
and swift as lightning to the combat flies
all side in parties and begin th attack
fans clap silks rustle and tough whalebones crack
heroes and heroines shouts confusdly rise
and bass and treble voices strike the skies
no common weapons in their hands are found
like gods they fight nor dread a mortal wound


so when bold homer makes the gods engage
and heavnly breasts with human passions rage
gainst pallas mars latona hermes arms
and all olympus rings with loud alarms
joves thunder roars heavn trembles all around
blue neptune storms the bellowing deeps resound
earth shakes her nodding towrs the ground gives way
and the pale ghosts start at the flash of day


triumphant umbriel on a sconces height
clappd his glad wings and sate to view the fight
proppd on the bodkin spears the sprites survey
the growing combat or assist the fray


while thro the press enragd thalestris flies
and scatters death around from both her eyes
a beau and witling perishd in the throng
one died in metaphor and one in song
o cruel nymph a living death i bear
cryd dapperwit and sunk beside his chair
a mournful glance sir fopling upwards cast
those eyes are made so killingwas his last
thus on maeanders flowry margin lies
th expiring swan and as he sings he dies


when bold sir plume had drawn clarissa down
chloe steppd in and killd him with a frown
she smild to see the doughty hero slain
but at her smile the beau revivd again


now jove suspends his golden scales in air
weighs the mens wits against the ladys hair
the doubtful beam long nods from side to side
at length the wits mount up the hairs subside


see fierce belinda on the baron flies
with more than usual lightning in her eyes
nor feard the chief th unequal fight to try
who sought no more than on his foe to die
but this bold lord with manly strength endud
she with one finger and a thumb subdud
just where the breath of life his nostrils drew
a charge of snuff the wily virgin threw
the gnomes direct to evry atom just
the pungent grains of titillating dust
sudden with starting tears each eye oerflows
and the high dome reechoes to his nose


now meet thy fate incensd belinda cryd
and drew a deadly bodkin from her side
the same his ancient personage to deck
her great great grandsire wore about his neck
in three sealrings which after melted down
formd a vast buckle for his widows gown
her infant grandames whistle next it grew
the bells she jingled and the whistle blew
then in a bodkin gracd her mothers hairs
which long she wore and now belinda wears


boast not my fall he cryd insulting foe
thou by some other shalt be laid as low
nor think to die dejects my lofty mind
all that i dread is leaving you behind
rather than so ah let me still survive
and burn in cupids flamesbut burn alive


restore the lock she cries and all around
restore the lock the vaulted roofs rebound
not fierce othello in so loud a strain
roard for the handkerchief that causd his pain
but see how oft ambitious aims are crossd
and chiefs contend till all the prize is lost
the lock obtaind with guilt and kept with pain
in evry place is sought but sought in vain
with such a prize no mortal must be blest
so heavn decrees with heavn who can contest


some thought it mounted to the lunar sphere
since all things lost on earth are treasurd there
there heros wits are kept in pondrous vases
and beaus in snuffboxes and tweezercases
there broken vows and deathbed alms are found
and lovers hearts with ends of riband bound
the courtiers promises and sick mans prayrs
the smiles of harlots and the tears of heirs
cages for gnats and chains to yoke a flea
dryd butterflies and tomes of casuistry


but trust the museshe saw it upward rise
tho markd by none but quick poetic eyes
so romes great founder to the heavns withdrew
to proculus alone confessd in view
a sudden star it shot thro liquid air
and drew behind a radiant trail of hair
not berenices locks first rose so bright
the heavns bespangling with dishevelld light
the sylphs behold it kindling as it flies
and pleasd pursue its progress thro the skies


this the beau monde shall from the mall survey
and hail with music its propitious ray
this the blest lover shall for venus take
and send up vows from rosamondas lake
this partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies
when next he looks thro galileos eyes
and hence th egregious wizard shall foredoom
the fate of louis and the fall of rome


then cease bright nymph to mourn thy ravishd hair
which adds new glory to the shining sphere
not all the tresses that fair head can boast
shall draw such envy as the lock you lost
for after all the murders of your eye
when after millions slain yourself shall die
when those fair suns shall set as set they must
and all those tresses shall be laid in dust
this lock the muse shall consecrate to fame
and midst the stars inscribe belindas name


tis hard to say if greater want of skill
appear in writing or in judging ill
but of the two less dangrous is th offence
to tire our patience than mislead our sense
some few in that but numbers err in this
ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss
a fool might once himself alone expose
now one in verse makes many more in prose


tis with our judgments as our watches none
go just alike yet each believes his own
in poets as true genius is but rare
true taste as seldom is the critics share
both must alike from heavn derive their light
these born to judge as well as those to write
let such teach others who themselves excel
and censure freely who have written well
authors are partial to their wit tis true
but are not critics to their judgment too


yet if we look more closely we shall find
most have the seeds of judgment in their mind
nature affords at least a glimmring light
the lines tho touchd but faintly are drawn right


but as the slightest sketch if justly tracd
is by illcolouring but the more disgracd
so by false learning is good sense defacd


some are bewilderd in the maze of schools
and some made coxcombs nature meant but fools


in search of wit these lose their common sense
and then turn critics in their own defence
each burns alike who can or cannot write
or with a rivals or an eunuchs spite
all fools have still an itching to deride
and fain would be upon the laughing side
if maevius scribble in apollos spite
there are who judge still worse than he can write


some have at first for wits then poets past
turnd critics next and provd plain fools at last
some neither can for wits nor critics pass
as heavy mules are neither horse nor ass
those halflearnd witlings numrous in our isle
as halfformd insects on the banks of nile
unfinishd things one knows not what to call
their generations so equivocal
to tell em would a hundred tongues require
or one vain wits that might a hundred tire


but you who seek to give and merit fame
and justly bear a critics noble name
be sure yourself and your own reach to know
how far your genius taste and learning go
launch not beyond your depth but be discreet
and mark that point where sense and dulness meet


nature to all things fixd the limits fit
and wisely curbd proud mans pretending wit
as on the land while here the ocean gains
in other parts it leaves wide sandy plains
thus in the soul while memory prevails
the solid powr of understanding fails
where beams of warm imagination play
the memorys soft figures melt away
one science only will one genius fit
so vast is art so narrow human wit
not only bounded to peculiar arts
but oft in those confind to single parts
like kings we lose the conquests gaind before
by vain ambition still to make them more
each might his sevral province well command
would all but stoop to what they understand


first follow nature and your judgment frame
by her just standard which is still the same
unerring nature still divinely bright
one clear unchangd and universal light
life force and beauty must to all impart
at once the source and end and test of art
art from that fund each just supply provides
works without show and without pomp presides
in some fair body thus th informing soul
with spirits feeds with vigour fills the whole
each motion guides and evry nerve sustains
itself unseen but in th effects remains
some to whom heavn in wit has been profuse
want as much more to turn it to its use
for wit and judgment often are at strife
tho meant each others aid like man and wife
t is more to guide than spur the muses steed
restrain his fury than provoke his speed
the winged courser like a genrous horse
shows most true mettle when you check his course


those rules of old discovered not devisd
are nature still but nature methodizd
nature like liberty is but restraind
by the same laws which first herself ordaind


hear how learnd greece her useful rules indites
when to repress and when indulge our flights
high on parnassus top her sons she showd
and pointed out those arduous paths they trod
held from afar aloft th immortal prize
and urgd the rest by equal steps to rise
just precepts thus from great examples givn
she drew from them what they derivd from heavn
the genrous critic fannd the poets fire
and taught the world with reason to admire
then criticism the muses handmaid provd
to dress her charms and make her more belovd
but following wits from that intention strayd
who could not win the mistress wood the maid
against the poets their own arms they turnd
sure to hate most the men from whom they learnd
so modern pothecaries taught the art
by doctors bills to play the doctors part
bold in the practice of mistaken rules
prescribe apply and call their masters fools
some on the leaves of ancient authors prey
nor time nor moths eer spoild so much as they
some drily plain without inventions aid
write dull receipts how poems may be made
these leave the sense their learning to display
and those explain the meaning quite away


you then whose judgment the right course would steer
know well each ancients proper character
his fable subject scope in evry page
religion country genius of his age
without all these at once before your eyes
cavil you may but never criticize
be homers works your study and delight
read them by day and meditate by night
thence form your judgment thence your maxims bring
and trace the muses upward to their spring
still with itself compard his text peruse
and let your comment be the mantuan muse


when first young maro in his boundless mind
a work t outlast immortal rome designd
perhaps he seemd above the critics law
and but from natures fountains scornd to draw
but when t examine evry part he came
nature and homer were he found the same


convincd amazd he checks the bold design
and rules as strict his labourd work confine
as if the stagirite oerlookd each line


learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem
to copy nature is to copy them
some beauties yet no precepts can declare
for theres a happiness as well as care


music resembles poetry in each
are nameless graces which no methods teach
and which a masterhand alone can reach


if where the rules not far enough extend
since rules were made but to promote their end
some lucky licence answer to the full
th intent proposd that licence is a rule
thus pegasus a nearer way to take
may boldly deviate from the common track
from vulgar bounds with brave disorder part
and snatch a grace beyond the reach of art
which without passing thro the judgment gains
the heart and all its end at once attains


in prospects thus some objects please our eyes
which out of natures common order rise
the shapeless rock or hanging precipice


great wits sometimes may gloriously offend
and rise to faults true critics dare not mend
but tho the ancients thus their rules invade
as kings dispense with laws themselves have made
moderns beware or if you must offend
against the precept neer transgress its end
let it be seldom and compelld by need
and have at least their precedent to plead
the critic else proceeds without remorse
seizes your fame and puts his laws in force


i know there are to whose presumptuous thoughts
those freer beauties evn in them seem faults
some figures monstrous and misshapd appear
considerd singly or beheld too near
which but proportiond to their light or place
due distance reconciles to form and grace
a prudent chief not always must display
his powrs in equal ranks and fair array
but with th occasion and the place comply
conceal his force nay seem sometimes to fly
those oft are stratagems which error seem
nor is it homer nods but we that dream


still green with bays each ancient altar stands
above the reach of sacrilegious hands
secure from flames from envys fiercer rage
destructive war and allinvolving age
see from each clime the learnd their incense bring
hear in all tongues consenting paeans ring
in praise so just let evry voice be joind
and fill the genral chorus of mankind
hail bards triumphant born in happier days
immortal heirs of universal praise


whose honours with increase of ages grow
as streams roll down enlarging as they flow
nations unborn your mighty names shall sound
and worlds applaud that must not yet be found
oh may some spark of your celestial fire
the last the meanest of your sons inspire
that on weak wings from far pursues your flights
glows while he reads but trembles as he writes
to teach vain wits a science little known
t admire superior sense and doubt their own


of all the causes which conspire to blind
mans erring judgment and misguide the mind
what the weak head with strongest bias rules
is _pride_ the neverfailing voice of fools
whatever nature has in worth denied
she gives in large recruits of needful pride
for as in bodies thus in souls we find
what wants in blood and spirits swelld with wind
pride where wit fails steps in to our defence
and fills up all the mighty void of sense


if once right reason drives that cloud away
truth breaks upon us with resistless day
trust not yourself but your defects to know
make use of evry friendand evry foe


a _little learning_ is a dangrous thing
drink deep or taste not the pierian spring
there shallow draughts intoxicate the brain
and drinking largely sobers us again
fird at first sight with what the muse imparts
in fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts
while from the bounded level of our mind
short views we take nor see the lengths behind
but more advancd behold with strange surprise
new distant scenes of endless science rise
so pleasd at first the towring alps we try
mount oer the vales and seem to tread the sky
th eternal snows appear already past
and the first clouds and mountains seem the last
but those attaind we tremble to survey
the growing labours of the lengthend way
th increasing prospect tires our wandring eyes
hills peep oer hills and alps on alps arise


a perfect judge will read each work of wit
with the same spirit that its author writ
survey the whole nor seek slight faults to find
where nature moves and rapture warms the mind
nor lose for that malignant dull delight
the genrous pleasure to be charmd with wit
but in such lays as neither ebb nor flow
correctly cold and regularly low
that shunning faults one quiet tenour keep
we cannot blame indeedbut we may sleep
in wit as nature what affects our hearts
is not th exactness of peculiar parts
tis not a lip or eye we beauty call
but the joint force and full result of all
thus when we view some wellproportiond dome
the worlds just wonder and evn thine o rome
no single parts unequally surprize
all comes united to th admiring eyes
no monstrous height or breadth or length appear
the whole at once is bold and regular


whoever thinks a faultless piece to see
thinks what neer was nor is nor eer shall be
in every work regard the writers end
since none can compass more than they intend
and if the means be just the conduct true
applause in spight of trivial faults is due
as men of breeding sometimes men of wit
t avoid great errors must the less commit
neglect the rules each verbal critic lays
for not to know some trifles is a praise
most critics fond of some subservient art
still make the whole depend upon a part
they talk of principles but notions prize
and all to one lovd folly sacrifice


once on a time la manchas knight they say
a certain bard encountring on the way
discoursd in terms as just with looks as sage
as eer could dennis of the grecian stage
concluding all were desprate sots and fools
who durst depart from aristotles rules
our author happy in a judge so nice
producd his play and beggd the knights advice
made him observe the subject and the plot
the manners passions unities what not
all which exact to rule were brought about
were but a combat in the lists left out
what leave the combat out exclaims the knight
yes or we must renounce the stagirite
not so by heavn he answers in a rage
knights squires and steeds must enter on the stage
so vast a throng the stage can neer contain
then build a new or act it in a plain


thus critics of less judgment than caprice
curious not knowing not exact but nice
form short ideas and offend in arts
as most in manners by a love to parts


some to _conceit_ alone their taste confine
and glittring thoughts struck out at evry line
pleasd with a work where nothings just or fit
one glaring chaos and wild heap of wit
poets like painters thus unskilld to trace
the naked nature and the living grace
with gold and jewels cover evry part
and hide with ornaments their want of art
true wit is nature to advantage dressd
what oft was thought but neer so well expressd
something whose truth convincd at sight we find
that gives us back the image of our mind
as shades more sweetly recommend the light
so modest plainness sets off sprightly wit
for works may have more wit than does em good
as bodies perish thro excess of blood


others for language all their care express
and value books as women men for dress
their praise is stillthe style is excellent
the sense they humbly take upon content
words are like leaves and where they most abound
much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found
false eloquence like the prismatic glass
its gaudy colours spreads on evry place
the face of nature we no more survey
all glares alike without distinction gay


but true expression like th unchanging sun
clears and improves whateer it shines upon
it gilds all objects but it alters none


expression is the dress of thought and still
appears more decent as more suitable
a vile conceit in pompous words expressd
is like a clown in regal purple dressd
for diffrent styles with diffrent subjects sort
as several garbs with country town and court
some by old words to fame have made pretence
ancients in phrase mere moderns in their sense
such labourd nothings in so strange a style
amaze th unlearnd and make the learned smile


unlucky as fungoso in the play
these sparks with awkward vanity display
what the fine gentleman wore yesterday


and but so mimic ancient wits at best
as apes our grandsires in their doublets drest
in words as fashions the same rule will hold
alike fantastic if too new or old
be not the first by whom the new are tryd
nor yet the last to lay the old aside


but most by numbers judge a poets song
and smooth or rough with them is right or wrong
in the bright muse though thousand charms conspire
her voice is all these tuneful fools admire


who haunt parnassus but to please their ear
not mend their minds as some to church repair
not for the doctrine but the music there


these equal syllables alone require
tho oft the ear the open vowes tire
while expletives their feeble aid do join
and ten low words oft creep in one dull line
while they ring round the same unvaryd chimes
with sure returns of still expected rhymes
whereeer you find the cooling western breeze
in the next line it whispers through the trees
if crystal streams with pleasing murmurs creep
the readers threatend not in vain with sleep
then at the last and only couplet fraught
with some unmeaning thing they call a thought
a needless alexandrine ends the song
that like a wounded snake drags its slow length along
leave such to tune their own dull rhymes and know
whats roundly smooth or languishingly slow
and praise the easy vigour of a line
where denhams strength and wallers sweetness join
true ease in writing comes from art not chance
as those move easiest who have learnd to dance
tis not enough no harshness gives offence
the sound must seem an echo to the sense
soft is the strain when zephyr gently blows
and the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows
but when loud surges lash the sounding shore
the hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar
when ajax strives some rocks vast weight to throw
the line too labours and the words move slow
not so when swift camilla scours the plain
flies oer th unbending corn and skims along the main
hear how timotheus varied lays surprize
and bid alternate passions fall and rise
while at each change the son of libyan jove
now burns with glory and then melts with love
now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow
now sighs steal out and tears begin to flow
persians and greeks like turns of nature found
and the worlds victor stood subdud by sound
the powr of music all our hearts allow
and what timotheus was is dryden now


avoid extremes and shun the fault of such
who still are pleasd too little or too much
at evry trifle scorn to take offence
that always shows great pride or little sense
those heads as stomachs are not sure the best
which nauseate all and nothing can digest
yet let not each gay turn thy rapture move
for fools admire but men of sense approve
as things seem large which we thro mists descry
dulness is ever apt to magnify


some foreign writers some our own despise
the ancients only or the moderns prize
thus wit like faith by each man is applyd
to one small sect and all are damnd beside
meanly they seek the blessing to confine
and force that sun but on a part to shine
which not alone the southern wit sublimes
but ripens spirits in cold northern climes
which from the first has shone on ages past
enlights the present and shall warm the last
tho each may feel increases and decays
and see now clearer and now darker days
regard not then if wit be old or new
but blame the false and value still the true


some neer advance a judgment of their own
but catch the spreading notion of the town
they reason and conclude by precedent
and own stale nonsense which they neer invent
some judge of authors names not works and then
nor praise nor blame the writings but the men
of all this servile herd the worst is he
that in proud dulness joins with quality
a constant critic at the great mans board
to fetch and carry nonsense for my lord
what woful stuff this madrigal would be
in some starvd hackney sonneteer or me
but let a lord once own the happy lines
how the wit brightens how the style refines
before his sacred name flies evry fault
and each exalted stanza teems with thought


the vulgar thus through imitation err
as oft the learnd by being singular
so much they scorn the crowd that if the throng
by chance go right they purposely go wrong
so schismatics the plain believers quit
and are but damnd for having too much wit
some praise at morning what they blame at night
but always think the last opinion right
a muse by these is like a mistress usd
this hour shes idolizd the next abusd
while their weak heads like towns unfortifyd
twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side
ask them the cause theyre wiser still they say
and still tomorrows wiser than today
we think our fathers fools so wise we grow
our wiser sons no doubt will think us so
once schooldivines this zealous isle oerspread
who knew most sentences was deepest read
faith gospel all seemd made to be disputed
and none had sense enough to be confuted
scotists and thomists now in peace remain
amidst their kindred cobwebs in ducklane
if faith itself has diffrent dresses worn
what wonder modes in wit should take their turn
oft leaving what is natural and fit
the current folly proves the ready wit
and authors think their reputation safe
which lives as long as fools are pleasd to laugh
some valuing those of their own side or mind
still make themselves the measure of mankind
fondly we think we honour merit then
when we but praise ourselves in other men


parties in wit attend on those of state
and public faction doubles private hate
pride malice folly against dryden rose
in various shapes of parsons critics beaus
but sense survivd when merry jests were past
for rising merit will buoy up at last
might he return and bless once more our eyes
new blackmores and new milbourns must arise
nay should great homer lift his awful head
zoilus again would start up from the dead
envy will merit as its shade pursue
but like a shadow proves the substance true
for envyd wit like sol eclipsd makes known
th opposing bodys grossness not its own
when first that sun too powrful beams displays
it draws up vapours which obscure its rays
but evn those clouds at last adorn its way
reflect new glories and augment the day


be thou the first true merit to befriend
his praise is lost who stays till all commend
short is the date alas of modern rhymes
and tis but just to let them live betimes
no longer now that golden age appears
when patriarchwits survivd a thousand years
now length of fame our second life is lost
and bare threescore is all evn that can boast
our sons their fathers failing language see
and such as chaucer is shall dryden be
so when the faithful pencil has designd
some bright idea of the masters mind
where a new world leaps out at his command
and ready nature waits upon his hand
when the ripe colours soften and unite
and sweetly melt into just shade and light
when mellowing years their full perfection give
and each bold figure just begins to live
the treachrous colours the fair art betray
and all the bright creation fades away


unhappy wit like most mistaken things
atones not for that envy which it brings
in youth alone its empty praise we boast
but soon the shortlivd vanity is lost
like some fair flowr the early spring supplies
that gaily blooms but evn in blooming dies
what is this wit which must our cares employ
the owners wife that other men enjoy
then most our trouble still when most admird
and still the more we give the more requird
whose fame with pains we guard but lose with ease
sure some to vex but never all to please
tis what the vicious fear the virtuous shun
by foolst is hated and by knaves undone


if wit so much from ignrance undergo
ah let not learning too commence its foe
of old those met rewards who could excel
and such were praisd who but endeavourd well
tho triumphs were to genrals only due
crowns were reservd to grace the soldiers too
now they who reach parnassus lofty crown
employ their pains to spurn some others down
and while selflove each jealous writer rules
contending wits become the sport of fools
but still the worst with most regret commend
for each ill author is as bad a friend
to what base ends and by what abject ways
are mortals urgd thro sacred lust of praise
ah neer so dire a thirst of glory boast
nor in the critic let the man be lost
goodnature and goodsense must ever join
to err is human to forgive divine


but if in noble minds some dregs remain
not yet purgd off of spleen and sour disdain
discharge that rage on more provoking crimes
nor fear a dearth in these flagitious times
no pardon vile obscenity should find
tho wit and art conspire to move your mind
but dulness with obscenity must prove
as shameful sure as impotence in love
in the fat age of pleasure wealth and ease
sprung the rank weed and thrivd with large increase
when love was all an easy monarchs care
seldom at council never in a war
jilts ruld the state and statesmen farces writ
nay wits had pensions and young lords had wit
the fair sate panting at a courtiers play
and not a mask went unimprovd away
the modest fan was lifted up no more
and virgins smild at what they blushd before
the following licence of a foreign reign
did all the dregs of bold socinus drain
then unbelieving priests reformd the nation
and taught more pleasant methods of salvation
where heavns free subjects might their rights dispute
lest god himself should seem too absolute
pulpits their sacred satire learnd to spare
and vice admird to find a flattrer there
encouragd thus wits titans bravd the skies
and the press groand with licensd blasphemies
these monsters critics with your darts engage
here point your thunder and exhaust your rage
yet shun their fault who scandalously nice
will needs mistake an author into vice
all seems infected that th infected spy
as all looks yellow to the jaundicd eye


learn then what morals critics ought to show
fort is but half a judges task to know
tis not enough taste judgment learning join
in all you speak let truth and candour shine
that not alone what to your sense is due
all may allow but seek your friendship too


be silent always when you doubt your sense
and speak tho sure with seeming diffidence
some positive persisting fops we know
who if once wrong will needs be always so
but you with pleasure own your errors past
and make each day a critic on the last


t is not enough your counsel still be true
blunt truths more mischief than nice falsehoods do
men must be taught as if you taught them not
and things unknown proposd as things forgot
without good breeding truth is disapprovd
that only makes superior sense belovd


be niggards of advice on no pretence
for the worst avarice is that of sense
with mean complacence neer betray your trust
nor be so civil as to prove unjust
fear not the anger of the wise to raise
those best can bear reproof who merit praise


t were well might critics still this freedom take
but appius reddens at each word you speak
and stares tremendous with a threatning eye
like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry
fear most to tax an honourable fool
whose right it is uncensurd to be dull
such without wit are poets when they please
as without learning they can take degrees
leave dangrous truths to unsuccessful satires
and flattery to fulsome dedicators
whom when they praise the world believes no more
than when they promise to give scribbling oer
t is best sometimes your censure to restrain
and charitably let the dull be vain
your silence there is better than your spite
for who can rail so long as they can write
still humming on their drowsy course they keep
and lashd so long like tops are lashd asleep
false steps but help them to renew the race
as after stumbling jades will mend their pace
what crowds of these impenitently bold
in sounds and jingling syllables grown old
still run on poets in a raging vein
evn to the dregs and squeezings of the brain
strain out the last dull droppings of their sense
and rhyme with all the rage of impotence


such shameless bards we have and yett is true
there are as mad abandond critics too
the bookful blockhead ignorantly read
with loads of learned lumber in his head
with his own tongue still edifies his ears
and always listning to himself appears
all books he reads and all he reads assails
from drydens fables down to durfeys tales
with him most authors steal their works or buy
garth did not write his own dispensary


name a new play and hes the poets friend
nay showd his faultsbut when would poets mend
no place so sacred from such fops is barrd
nor is pauls church more safe than pauls churchyard
nay fly to altars there theyll talk you dead
for fools rush in where angels fear to tread


distrustful sense with modest caution speaks
it still looks home and short excursions makes
but rattling nonsense in full volleys breaks


and never shockd and never turnd aside
bursts out resistless with a thundring tide


but wheres the man who counsel can bestow
still pleasd to teach and yet not proud to know
unbiassd or by favour or by spite
not dully prepossessd nor blindly right
tho learnd wellbred and tho wellbred sincere
modestly bold and humanly severe
who to a friend his faults can freely show
and gladly praise the merit of a foe
blest with a taste exact yet unconfind
a knowledge both of books and human kind
genrous converse a soul exempt from pride
and love to praise with reason on his side


such once were critics such the happy few
athens and rome in better ages knew
the mighty stagirite first left the shore
spread all his sails and durst the deeps explore
he steerd securely and discoverd far
led by the light of the maeonian star
poets a race long unconfind and free
still fond and proud of savage liberty
receivd his laws and stood convincd t was fit
who conquerd nature should preside oer wit


horace still charms with graceful negligence
and without method talks us into sense
will like a friend familiarly convey
the truest notions in the easiest way
he who supreme in judgment as in wit
might boldly censure as he boldly writ
yet judgd with coolness tho he sung with fire
his precepts teach but what his works inspire
our critics take a contrary extreme
they judge with fury but they write with fleme
nor suffers horace more in wrong translations
by wits than critics in as wrong quotations


see dionysius homers thoughts refine
and call new beauties forth from evry line
fancy and art in gay petronius please
the scholars learning with the courtiers ease


in grave quintilians copious work we find
the justest rules and clearest method joind
thus useful arms in magazines we place
all rangd in order and disposd with grace
but less to please the eye than arm the hand
still fit for use and ready at command


thee bold longinus all the nine inspire
and bless their critic with a poets fire
an ardent judge who zealous in his trust
with warmth gives sentence yet is always just
whose own example strengthens all his laws
and is himself that great sublime he draws


thus long succeeding critics justly reignd
licence repressd and useful laws ordaind
learning and rome alike in empire grew
and arts still followd where her eagles flew
from the same foes at last both felt their doom
and the same age saw learning fall and rome
with tyranny then superstition joind
as that the body this enslavd the mind
much was believd but little understood
and to be dull was construd to be good
a second deluge learning thus oerrun
and the monks finishd what the goths begun


at length erasmus that great injurd name
the glory of the priesthood and the shame
stemmd the wild torrent of a barbrous age
and drove those holy vandals off the stage


but see each muse in leos golden days
starts from her trance and trims her witherd bays
romes ancient genius oer its ruins spread
shakes off the dust and rears his revrend head
then sculpture and her sisterarts revive
stones leapd to form and rocks began to live
with sweeter notes each rising temple rung
a raphael painted and a vida sung
immortal vida on whose honourd brow
the poets bays and critics ivy grow
cremona now shal ever boast thy name
as next in place to mantua next in fame


but soon by impious arms from latium chasd
their ancient bounds the banishd muses passd
thence arts oer all the northern world advance
but criticlearning flourishd most in france
the rules a nation born to serve obeys
and boileau still in right of horace sways
but we brave britons foreign laws despisd
and kept unconquerd and uncivilizd
fierce for the liberties of wit and bold
we still defyd the romans as of old
yet some there were among the sounder few
of those who less presumd and better knew
who durst assert the juster ancient cause
and here restord wits fundamental laws
such was the muse whose rules and practice tell
natures chief masterpiece is writing well


such was roscommon not more learnd than good
with manners genrous as his noble blood
to him the wit of greece and rome was known
and evry authors merit but his own
such late was walshthe muses judge and friend
who justly knew to blame or to commend
to failings mild but zealous for desert
the clearest head and the sincerest heart
this humble praise lamented shade receive
this praise at least a grateful muse may give
the muse whose early voice you taught to sing
prescribd her heights and prund her tender wing
her guide now lost no more attempts to rise
but in low numbers short excursions tries
content if hence th unlearnd their wants may view
the learnd reflect on what before they knew
careless of censure nor too fond of fame
still pleasd to praise yet not afraid to blame
averse alike to flatter or offend
not free from faults nor yet too vain to mend


awake my st john leave all meaner things
to low ambition and the pride of kings
let us since life can little more supply
than just to look about us and to die
expatiate free oer all this scene of man
a mighty maze but not without a plan
a wild where weeds and flowrs promiscuous shoot
or garden tempting with forbidden fruit
together let us beat this ample field
try what the open what the covert yield
the latent tracts the giddy heights explore
of all who blindly creep or sightless soar
eye natures walks shoot folly as it flies
and catch the manners living as they rise
laugh where we must be candid where we can
but vindicate the ways of god to man


say first of god above or man below
what can we reason but from what we know
of man what see we but his station here
from which to reason or to which refer
thro worlds unnumberd tho the god be known
tis ours to trace him only in our own
he who thro vast immensity can pierce
see worlds on worlds compose one universe
observe how system into system runs
what other planets circle other suns
what varyd being peoples evry star
may tell why heavn has made us as we are
but of this frame the bearings and the ties
the strong connexions nice dependencies
gradations just has thy pervading soul
lookd thro or can a part contain the whole


is the great chain that draws all to agree
and drawn supports upheld by god or thee


ii presumptuous man the reason wouldst thou find
why formd so weak so little and so blind
first if thou canst the harder reason guess
why formd no weaker blinder and no less
ask of thy mother earth why oaks are made
taller or stronger than the weeds they shade
or ask of yonder argent fields above
why joves satellites are less than jove


of systems possible if tis confest
that wisdom infinite must form the best
where all must full or not coherent be
and all that rises rise in due degree
then in the scale of reasning life tis plain
there must be somewhere such a rank as man
and all the question wrangle eer so long
is only this if god has placd him wrong


respecting man whatever wrong we call
may must be right as relative to all
in human works tho labourd on with pain
a thousand movements scarce one purpose gain
in gods one single can its end produce
yet serves to second too some other use
so man who here seems principal alone
perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown
touches some wheel or verges to some goal
tis but a part we see and not a whole


when the proud steed shall know why man restrains
his fiery course or drives him oer the plains
when the dull ox why now he breaks the clod
is now a victim and now aegypts god
then shall mans pride and dulness comprehend
his actions passions beings use and end
why doing suffring checkd impelld and why
this hour a slave the next a deity


then say not mans imperfect heavn in fault
say rather mans as perfect as he ought
his knowledge measurd to his state and place
his time a moment and a point his space
if to be perfect in a certain sphere
what matter soon or late or here or there
the blest to day is as completely so
as who began a thousand years ago


iii heavn from all creatures hides the book of fate
all but the page prescribd their present state
from brutes what men from men what spirits know
or who could suffer being here below
the lamb thy riot dooms to bleed today
had he thy reason would he skip and play
pleasd to the last he crops the flowry food
and licks the hand just raisd to shed his blood
oh blindness to the future kindly givn
that each may fill the circle markd by heavn
who sees with equal eye as god of all
a hero perish or a sparrow fall
atoms or systems into ruin hurld
and now a bubble burst and now a world


hope humbly then with trembling pinions soar
wait the great teacher death and god adore
what future bliss he gives not thee to know
but gives that hope to be thy blessing now
hope springs eternal in the human breast
man never is but always to be blest
the soul uneasy and confind from home
rests and expatiates in a life to come


lo the poor indian whose untutord mind
sees god in clouds or hears him in the wind
his soul proud science never taught to stray
far as the solar walk or milky way
yet simple nature to his hope has givn
behind the cloudtopt hill an humbler heavn
some safer world in depth of woods embracd
some happier island in the watry waste
where slaves once more their native land behold
no fiends torment no christians thirst for gold
to be contents his natural desire
he asks no angels wing no seraphs fire
but thinks admitted to that equal sky
his faithful dog shall bear him company


iv go wiser thou and in thy scale of sense
weight thy opinion against providence
call imperfection what thou fancyst such
say here he gives too little there too much
destroy all creatures for thy sport or gust
yet cry if mans unhappy gods unjust
if man alone engross not heavns high care
alone made perfect here immortal there


snatch from his hand the balance and the rod
rejudge his justice be the god of god
in pride in reasning pride our error lies
all quit their sphere and rush into the skies


pride still is aiming at the blest abodes
men would be angels angels would be gods
aspiring to be gods if angels fell
aspiring to be angels men rebel
and who but wishes to invert the laws
of order sins against th eternal cause


v ask for what end the heavnly bodies shine
earth for whose use pride answers tis for mine
for me kind nature wakes her genial powr
suckles each herb and spreads out evry flowr
annual for me the grape the rose renew
the juice nectareous and the balmy dew
for me the mine a thousand treasures brings
for me health gushes from a thousand springs
seas roll to waft me suns to light me rise
my footstool earth my canopy the skies


but errs not nature from his gracious end
from burning suns when livid deaths descend
when earthquakes swallow or when tempests sweep
towns to one grave whole nations to the deep
no tis replyd the first almighty cause
acts not by partial but by genral laws
th exceptions few some change since all began
and what created perfectwhy then man
if the great end be human happiness
then nature deviates and can man do less
as much that end a constant course requires
of showrs and sunshine as of mans desires
as much eternal springs and cloudless skies
as men for ever temprate calm and wise
if plagues or earthquakes break not heavns design
why then a borgia or a catiline
who knows but he whose hand the lightning forms
who heaves old ocean and who wings the storms
pours fierce ambition in a caesars mind
or turns young ammon loose to scourge mankind
from pride from pride our very reasning springs
account for moral as for natral things
why charge we heavn in those in these acquit
in both to reason right is to submit


better for us perhaps it might appear
were there all harmony all virtue here
that never air or ocean felt the wind
that never passion discomposd the mind
but all subsists by elemental strife
and passions are the elements of life
the genral order since the whole began
is kept in nature and is kept in man


vi what would this man now upward will he soar
and little less than angel would be more
now looking downwards just as grievd appears
to want the strength of bulls the fur of bears
made for his use all creatures if he call
say what their use had he the powrs of all
nature to these without profusion kind
the proper organs proper powrs assignd
each seeming want compensated of course
here with degrees of swiftness there of force
all in exact proportion to the state
nothing to add and nothing to abate
each beast each insect happy in its own
is heavn unkind to man and man alone
shall he alone whom rational we call
be pleasd with nothing if not blessd with all


the bliss of man could pride that blessing find
is not to act or think beyond mankind
no powrs of body or of soul to share
but what his nature and his state can bear
why has not man a microscopic eye
for this plain reason man is not a fly
say what the use were finer optics givn
t inspect a mite not comprehend the heavn
or touch if tremblingly alive all oer
to smart and agonize at every pore
or quick effluvia darting thro the brain
die of a rose in aromatic pain
if nature thunderd in his opning ears
and stunnd him with the music of the spheres
how would he wish that heavn had left him still
the whispring zephyr and the purling rill
who finds not providence all good and wise
alike in what it gives and what denies


vii far as creations ample range extends
the scale of sensual mental powrs ascends
mark how it mounts to mans imperial race
from the green myriads in the peopled grass
what modes of sight betwixt each wide extreme
the moles dim curtain and the lynxs beam
of smell the headlong lioness between
and hound sagacious on the tainted green
of hearing from the life that fills the flood
to that which warbles thro the vernal wood
the spiders touch how exquisitely fine
feels at each thread and lives along the line
in the nice bee what sense so subtly true
from poisnous herbs extracts the healing dew
how instinct varies in the grovlling swine
compard halfreasning elephant with thine
twixt that and reason what a nice barrier
for ever seprate yet for ever near
remembrance and reflection how allyd
what thin partitions sense from thought divide
and middle natures how they long to join
yet never pass th insuperable line
without this just gradation could they be
subjected these to those or all to thee
the powrs of all subdud by thee alone
is not thy reason all these powrs in one


viii see thro this air this ocean and this earth
all matter quick and bursting into birth
above how high progressive life may go
around how wide how deep extend below
vast chain of being which from god began
natures ethereal human angel man
beast bird fish insect what no eye can see
no glass can reach from infinite to thee
from thee to nothingon superior powrs
were we to press inferior might on ours
or in the full creation leave a void
where one step broken the great scales destroyd
from natures chain whatever link you strike
tenth or ten thousandth breaks the chain alike


and if each system in gradation roll
alike essential to th amazing whole
the least confusion but in one not all
that system only but the whole must fall
let earth unbalancd from her orbit fly
planets and suns run lawless thro the sky
let ruling angels from their spheres be hurld
being on being wreckd and world on world
heavns whole foundations to their centre nod
and nature tremble to the throne of god
all this dread order breakfor whom for thee
vile wormoh madness pride impiety


ix what if the foot ordaind the dust to tread
or hand to toil aspird to be the head
what if the head the eye or ear repind
to serve mere engines to the ruling mind
just as absurd for any part to claim
to be another in this genral frame
just as absurd to mourn the tasks or pains
the great directing mind of all ordains


all are but parts of one stupendous whole
whose body nature is and god the soul
that changd thro all and yet in all the same
great in the earth as in th ethereal frame
warms in the sun refreshes in the breeze
glows in the stars and blossoms in the trees
lives thro all life extends thro all extent
spreads undivided operates unspent
breathes in our soul informs our mortal part
as full as perfect in a hair as heart
as full as perfect in vile man that mourns
as the rapt seraph that adores and burns
to him no high no low no great no small
he fills he bounds connects and equals all


x cease then nor order imperfection name
our proper bliss depends on what we blame
know thy own point this kind this due degree
of blindness weakness heavn bestows on thee
submitin this or any other sphere
secure to be as blest as thou canst bear
safe in the hand of one disposing powr
or in the natal or the mortal hour
all nature is but art unknown to thee
all chance direction which thou canst not see
all discord harmony not understood
all partial evil universal good
and spite of pride in erring reasons spite
one truth is clear whatever is is right


p shut shut the door good john fatigud i said
tie up the knocker say im sick im dead
the dogstar rages nayt is past a doubt
all bedlam or parnassus is let out
fire in each eye and papers in each hand
they rave recite and madden round the land


what walls can guard me or what shade can hide
they pierce my thickets thro my grot they glide
by land by water they renew the charge
they stop the chariot and they board the barge
no place is sacred not the church is free
evn sunday shines no sabbathday to me
then from the mint walks forth the man of rhyme
happy to catch me just at dinnertime


is there a parson much bemusd in beer
a maudlin poetess a rhyming peer
a clerk foredoomd his fathers soul to cross
who pens a stanza when he should _engross_
is there who lockd from ink and paper scrawls
with desprate charcoal round his darkend walls
all fly to twitnam and in humble strain
apply to me to keep them mad or vain
arthur whose giddy son neglects the laws
imputes to me and my damnd works the cause
poor cornus sees his frantic wife elope
and curses wit and poetry and pope


friend to my life which did not you prolong
the world had wanted many an idle song
what _drop_ or _nostrum_ can this plague remove
or which must end me a fools wrath or love
a dire dilemma either way im sped
if foes they write if friends they read me dead
seizd and tied down to judge how wretched i
who cant be silent and who will not lie
to laugh were want of goodness and of grace
and to be grave exceeds all powr of face
i sit with sad civility i read
with honest anguish and an aching head
and drop at last but in unwilling ears
this saving counsel keep your piece nine years


nine years cries he who high in drurylane
lulld by soft zephyrs thro the broken pane
rhymes ere he wakes and prints before _term_ ends
obligd by hunger and request of friends
the piece you think is incorrect why take it
im all submission what youd have it make it


three things anothers modest wishes bound
my friendship and a prologue and ten pound


pitholeon sends to me you know his grace
i want a patron ask him for a place
pitholeon libelld mebut heres a letter
informs you sir t was when he knew no better
dare you refuse him curll invites to dine
hell write a _journal_ or hell turn divine


bless me a packettis a stranger sues
a virgin tragedy an orphan muse
if i dislike it furies death and rage
if i approve commend it to the stage
there thank my stars my whole commission ends
the playrs and i are luckily no friends
fird that the house reject him sdeath ill print it
and shame the foolsyour intrest sir with lintot
lintot dull rogue will think your price too much
not sir if you revise it and retouch
all my demurs but double his attacks
at last he whispers do and we go snacks
glad of a quarrel straight i clap the door
sir let me see your works and you no more


tis sung when midas ears began to spring
midas a sacred person and a king
his very minister who spyd them first
some say his queen was forcd to speak or burst
and is not mine my friend a sorer case
when evry coxcomb perks them in my face
a good friend forbear you deal in dangrous things
id never name queens ministers or kings
keep close to ears and those let asses prick
tis nothingp nothing if they bite and kick
out with it dunciad let the secret pass
that secret to each fool that hes an ass
the truth once told and wherefore should we lie
the queen of midas slept and so may i


you think this cruel take it for a rule
no creature smarts so little as a fool
let peals of laughter codrus round thee break
thou unconcernd canst hear the mighty crack
pit box and gallry in convulsions hurld
thou standst unshook amidst a bursting world
who shames a scribbler break one cobweb thro
he spins the slight selfpleasing thread anew
destroy his fib or sophistry in vain
the creatures at his dirty work again
thrond in the centre of his thin designs
proud of a vast extent of flimsy lines
whom have i hurt has poet yet or peer
lost the archd eyebrow or parnassian sneer


does not one table bavius still admit
still to one bishop philips seem a wit
still sapphoa hold for gods sakeyou ll offend
no namesbe calmlearn prudence of a friend
i too could write and i am twice as tall
but foes like thesep one flattrers worse than all
of all mad creatures if the learnd are right
it is the slaver kills and not the bite
a fool quite angry is quite innocent
alas tis ten times worse when they _repent_


one dedicates in high heroic prose
and ridicules beyond a hundred foes
one from all grubstreet will my fame defend
and more abusive calls himself my friend
this prints my _letters_ that expects a bribe
and others roar aloud subscribe subscribe


there are who to my person pay their court
i cough like _horace_ and tho lean am short
_ammons_ great son one shoulder had too high
such _ovids_ nose and sir you have an eye
go on obliging creatures make me see
all that disgracd my betters met in me
say for my comfort languishing in bed
just so immortal _maro_ held his head
and when i die be sure you let me know
great _homer_ died three thousand years ago


why did i write what sin to me unknown
dipt me in ink my parents or my own
as yet a child nor yet a fool to fame
i lispd in numbers for the numbers came
i left no calling for this idle trade
no duty broke no father disobeyd
the muse but servd to ease some friend not wife
to help me thro this long disease my life
to second arbuthnot thy art and care
and teach the being you preservd to bear


but why then publish _granville_ the polite
and knowing _walsh_ would tell me i could write
wellnaturd _garth_ inflamd with early praise
and _congreve_ lovd and _swift_ endurd my lays
the courtly _talbot somers sheffield_ read
evn mitred _rochester_ would nod the head
and _st johns_ self great _drydens_ friends before
with open arms receivd one poet more
happy my studies when by these approvd
happier their author when by these belovd
from these the world will judge of men and books
not from the _burnets oldmixons_ and _cookes_


soft were my numbers who could take offence
while pure description held the place of sense
like gentle _fannys_ was my flowry theme
a painted mistress or a purling stream
yet then did _gildon_ draw his venal quill
i wishd the man a dinner and sat still
yet then did _dennis_ rave in furious fret
i never answerdi was not in debt
if want provokd or madness made them print
i wagd no war with _bedlam_ or the _mint_


did some more sober critic come abroad
if wrong i smild if right i kissd the rod
pains reading study are their just pretence
and all they want is spirit taste and sense
commas and points they set exactly right
and twere a sin to rob them of their mite
yet neer one sprig of laurel gracd these ribalds
from slashing _bentley_ down to pidling _tibalds_
each wight who reads not and but scans and spells
each wordcatcher that lives on syllables
evn such small critics some regard may claim
preservd in _miltons_ or in _shakespeares_ name
pretty in amber to observe the forms
of hairs or straws or dirt or grubs or worms
the things we know are neither rich nor rare
but wonder how the devil they got there


were others angry i excusd them too
well might they rage i gave them but their due
a mans true merit tis not hard to find
but each mans secret standard in his mind
that castingweight pride adds to emptiness
this who can gratify for who can _guess_
the bard whom pilferd pastorals renown
who turns a persian tale for half a crown
just writes to make his barrenness appear
and strains from hardbound brains eight lines a year
he who still wanting tho he lives on theft
steals much spends little yet has nothing left
and he who now to sense now nonsense leaning
means not but blunders round about a meaning
and he whose fustians so sublimely bad
it is not poetry but prose run mad
all these my modest satire bade _translate_
and ownd that nine such poets made a _tate_
how did they fume and stamp and roar and chafe
and swear not addison himself was safe


peace to all such but were there one whose fires
true genius kindles and fair fame inspires
blest with each talent and each art to please
and born to write converse and live with ease
should such a man too fond to rule alone
bear like the turk no brother near the throne
view him with scornful yet with jealous eyes
and hate for arts that causd himself to rise
damn with faint praise assent with civil leer
and without sneering teach the rest to sneer
willing to wound and yet afraid to strike
just hint a fault and hesitate dislike
alike reservd to blame or to commend
a timrous foe and a suspicious friend
dreading evn fools by flatterers besiegd
and so obliging that he neer obligd
like _cato_ give his little senate laws
and sit attentive to his own applause
while wits and templars evry sentence raise
and wonder with a foolish face of praise
who but must laugh if such a man there be
who would not weep if atticus were he


what tho my name stood rubric on the walls
or plaisterd posts with claps in capitals
or smoking forth a hundred hawkers load
on wings of winds came flying all abroad
i sought no homage from the race that write
i kept like asian monarchs from their sight
poems i heeded now berhymd so long
no more than thou great george a birthday song
i neer with wits or witlings passd my days
to spread about the itch of verse and praise
nor like a puppy daggled thro the town
to fetch and carry singsong up and down
nor at rehearsals sweat and mouthd and cryd
with handkerchief and orange at my side
but sick of fops and poetry and prate
to bufo left the whole castalian state


proud as apollo on his forked hill
sat fullblown bufo puffd by evry quill
fed with soft dedication all day long
horace and he went hand in hand in song
his library where busts of poets dead
and a true pindar stood without a head
receivd of wits an undistinguishd race
who first his judgment askd and then a place
much they extolld his pictures much his seat
and flatterd evry day and some days eat
till grown more frugal in his riper days
he paid some bards with port and some with praise
to some a dry rehearsal saw assignd
and others harder still he paid in kind
_dryden_ alone what wonder came not nigh
_dryden_ alone escapd this judging eye
but still the _great_ have kindness in reserve
he helpd to bury whom he helpd to starve


may some choice patron bless each gray goose quill
may evry _bavius_ have his _bufo_ still
so when a statesman wants a days defence
or envy holds a whole weeks war with sense
or simple pride for flattry makes demands
may dunce by dunce be whistled off my hands
blest be the _great_ for those they take away
and those they left me for they left me gay
left me to see neglected genius bloom
neglected die and tell it on his tomb
of all thy blameless life the sole return
my verse and queenbry weeping oer thy urn


oh let me live my own and die so too
to live and die is all i have to do
maintain a poets dignity and ease
and see what friends and read what books i please
above a patron tho i condescend
sometimes to call a minister my friend
i was not born for courts or great affairs
i pay my debts believe and say my prayrs
can sleep without a poem in my head
nor know if _dennis_ be alive or dead


why am i askd what next shall see the light
heavns was i born for nothing but to write
has life no joys for me or to be grave
have i no friend to serve no soul to save
i found him close with _swift_indeed no doubt
cries prating _balbus_ something will come out
tis all in vain deny it as i will
no such a genius never can lie still
and then for mine obligingly mistakes
the first lampoon sir _will_ or _bubo_ makes
poor guiltless i and can i choose but smile
when evry coxcomb knows me by my _style_


curst be the verse how well soeer it flow
that tends to make one worthy man my foe
give virtue scandal innocence a fear
or from the softeyed virgin steal a tear
but he who hurts a harmless neighbours peace
insults falln worth or beauty in distress
who loves a lie lame slander helps about
who writes a libel or who copies out
that fop whose pride affects a patrons name
yet absent wounds an authors honest fame
who can _your_ merit _selfishly_ approve
and show the _sense_ of it without the _love_
who has the vanity to call you friend
yet wants the honour injurd to defend
who tells whateer you think whateer you say
and if he lie not must at least betray
who to the _dean_ and _silver bell_ can swear
and sees at _canons_ what was never there
who reads but with a lust to misapply
make satire a lampoon and fiction lie
a lash like mine no honest man shall dread
but all such babbling blockheads in his stead


let _sporus_ tremblea what that thing of silk
_sporus_ that mere white curd of asss milk
satire or sense alas can _sporus_ feel
who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel
p yet let me flap this bug with gilded wings
this painted child of dirt that stinks and stings
whose buzz the witty and the fair annoys
yet wit neer tastes and beauty neer enjoys
so wellbred spaniels civilly delight
in mumbling of the game they dare not bite
eternal smiles his emptiness betray
as shallow streams run dimpling all the way
whether in florid impotence he speaks
and as the prompter breathes the puppet squeaks
or at the ear of _eve_ familiar toad
half froth half venom spits himself abroad
in puns or politics or tales or lies
or spite or smut or rhymes or blasphemies


his wit all seesaw between _that_ and _this_
now high now low now master up now miss
and he himself one vile antithesis


amphibious thing that acting either part
the trifling head or the corrupted heart
fop at the toilet flattrer at the board
now trips a lady and now struts a lord
_eves_ tempter thus the rabbins have exprest
a cherubs face a reptile all the rest
beauty that shocks you parts that none will trust
wit that can creep and pride that licks the dust


not fortunes worshipper nor fashions fool
not lucres madman nor ambitions tool
not proud nor servilebe one poets praise
that if he pleasd he pleasd by manly ways
that flattry evn to kings he held a shame
and thought a lie in verse or prose the same
that not in fancys maze he wanderd long
but stoopd to truth and moralizd his song
that not for fame but virtues better end
he stood the furious foe the timid friend
the damning critic half approving wit
the coxcomb hit or fearing to be hit
laughd at the loss of friends he never had
the dull the proud the wicked and the mad
the distant threats of vengeance on his head
the blow unfelt the tear he never shed
the tale revivd the lie so oft oerthrown
th imputed trash and dulness not his own
the morals blackend when the writings scape
the libelld person and the picturd shape
abuse on all he lovd or lovd him spread
a friend in exile or a father dead
the whisper that to greatness still too near
perhaps yet vibrates on his sovreigns ear
welcome for thee fair _virtue_ all the past
for thee fair virtue welcome evn the _last_
a but why insult the poor affront the great
p a knaves a knave to me in evry state
alike my scorn if he succeed or fail
_sporus_ at court or _japhet_ in a jail
a hireling scribbler or a hireling peer
knight of the post corrupt or of the shire
if on a pillory or near a throne
he gain his princes ear or lose his own
yet soft by nature more a dupe than wit
_sappho_ can tell you how this man was bit
this dreaded satrist _dennis_ will confess
foe to his pride but friend to his distress
so humble he has knockd at _tibbalds_ door
has drunk with _cibber_ nay has rhymd for _moore_
full ten years slanderd did he once reply
three thousand suns went down on _welsteds_ lie
to please a mistress one aspersd his life
he lashd him not but let her be his wife
let _budgel_ charge low _grubstreet_ on his quill
and write whateer he pleasd except his will
let the two _curlls_ of town and court abuse
his father mother body soul and muse
yet why that father held it for a rule
it was a sin to call our neighbour fool
that harmless mother thought no wife a whore
hear this and spare his family _james moore_
unspotted names and memorable long
if there be force in virtue or in song


of gentle blood part shed in honours cause
while yet in _britain_ honour had applause
each parent sprunga what fortune prayp their own
and better got than _bestias_ from the throne
born to no pride inheriting no strife
nor marrying discord in a noble wife
stranger to civil and religious rage
the good man walkd innoxious thro his age
nor courts he saw no suits would ever try
nor dard an oath nor hazarded a lie
unlearnd he knew no schoolmans subtle art
no language but the language of the heart
by nature honest by experience wise
healthy by temprance and by exercise
his life tho long to sickness past unknown
his death was instant and without a groan
o grant me thus to live and thus to die
who sprung from kings shall know less joy than i


o friend may each domestic bliss be thine
be no unpleasing melancholy mine
me let the tender office long engage
to rock the cradle of reposing age
with lenient arts extend a mothers breath
make languor smile and smooth the bed of death
explore the thought explain the asking eye
and keep a while one parent from the sky
on cares like these if length of days attend
may heavn to bless those days preserve my friend
preserve him social cheerful and serene
and just as rich as when he servd a queen
a whether that blessing be denyd or givn
thus far was right the rest belongs to heavn


happy the man whose wish and care
a few paternal acres bound
content to breathe his native air
in his own ground


whose herds with milk whose fields with bread
whose flocks supply him with attire
whose trees in summer yield him shade
in winter fire


blest who can unconcerndly find
hours days and years slide soft away
in health of body peace of mind
quiet by day


sound sleep by night study and ease
together mixt sweet recreation
and innocence which most does please
with meditation


thus let me live unseen unknown
thus unlamented let me die
steal from the world and not a stone
tell where i lie


in vain in vainthe allcomposing hour
resistless falls the muse obeys the powr
she comes she comes the sable throne behold
of _night_ primaeval and of _chaos_ old
before her _fancys_ gilded clouds decay
and all its varying rainbows die away
_wit_ shoots in vain its momentary fires
the meteor drops and in a flash expires
as one by one at dread medeas strain
the sickning stars fade off th ethereal plain
as argus eyes by hermes wand opprest
closd one by one to everlasting rest
thus at her felt approach and secret might
_art_ after _art_ goes out and all is night
see skulking _truth_ to her old cavern fled
mountains of casuistry heapd oer her head
_philosophy_ that leand on heavn before
shrinks to her second cause and is no more
_physic_ of _metaphysic_ begs defence
and _metaphysic_ calls for aid on _sense_
see _mystery_ to _mathematics_ fly
in vain they gaze turn giddy rave and die
_religion_ blushing veils her sacred fires
and unawares _morality_ expires
for _public_ flame nor _private_ dares to shine
nor _human_ spark is left nor glimpse _divine_
lo thy dread empire chaos is restord
light dies before thy uncreating word
thy hand great anarch lets the curtain fall
and universal darkness buries all


first in these fields i try the sylvan strains
nor blush to sport on windsors blissful plains
fair thames flow gently from thy sacred spring
while on thy banks sicilian muses sing
let vernal airs through trembling osiers play
and albions cliffs resound the rural lay


you that too wise for pride too good for power
enjoy the glory to be great no more
and carrying with you all the world can boast
to all the world illustriously are lost
oh let my muse her slender reed inspire
till in your native shades you tune the lyre
so when the nightingale to rest removes
the thrush may chant to the forsaken groves
but charmd to silence listens while she sings
and all the aerial audience clap their wings


soon as the flocks shook off the nightly dews
two swains whom love kept wakeful and the muse
pourd oer the whitening vale their fleecy care
fresh as the morn and as the season fair
the dawn now blushing on the mountains side
thus daphnis spoke and strephou thus replied


hear how the birds on every bloomy spray
with joyous music wake the dawning day
why sit we mute when early linnets sing
when warbling philomel salutes the spring
why sit we sad when phosphor shines so clear
and lavish nature paints the purple year


sing then and damon shall attend the strain
while yon slow oxen turn the furrowd plain
here the bright crocus and blue violet glow
here western winds on breathing roses blow
ill stake yon lamb that near the fountain plays
and from the brink his dancing shade surveys


and i this bowl where wanton ivy twines
and swelling clusters bend the curling vines
four figures rising from the work appear
the various seasons of the rolling year
and what is that which binds the radiant sky
where twelve fair signs in beauteous order lie


then sing by turns by turns the muses sing
now hawthorns blossom now the daisies spring
now leaves the trees and flowers adorn the ground
begin the vales shall every note rebound


inspire me phoebus in my delias praise
with wallers strains or granvilles moving lays
a milkwhite bull shall at your altars stand
that threats a fight and spurns the rising sand


o love for sylvia let me gain the prize
and make my tongue victorious as her eyes
no lambs or sheep for victims ill impart
thy victim love shall be the shepherds heart


me gentle delia beckons from the plain
then hid in shades eludes her eager swain
but feigns a laugh to see me search around
and by that laugh the willing fair is found


the sprightly sylvia trips along the green
she runs but hopes she does not run unseen
while a kind glance at her pursuer flies
how much at variance are her feet and eyes


oer golden sands let rich pactolus flow
and trees weep amber on the banks of po
blest thamess shores the brightest beauties yield
feed here my lambs ill seek no distant field


celestial venus haunts idalias groves
diana cynthus ceres hybla loves
if windsorshades delight the matchless maid
cynthus and hybla yield to windsorshade


all nature mourns the skies relent in showers
hushd are the birds and closed the drooping flowers
if delia smile the flowers begin to spring
the skies to brighten and the birds to sing


all nature laughs the groves are fresh and fair
the suns mild lustre warms the vital air
if sylvia smiles new glories gild the shore
and vanquishd nature seems to charm no more


in spring the fields in autumn hills i love
at morn the plains at noon the shady grove
but delia always absent from her sight
nor plains at morn nor groves at noon delight


sylvias like autumn ripe yet mild as may
more bright than noon yet fresh as early day
even spring displeases when she shines not here
but blest with her tis spring throughout the year


say daphnis say in what glad soil appears
a wondrous tree that sacred monarchs bears
tell me but this and ill disclaim the prize
and give the conquest to thy sylvias eyes


nay tell me first in what more happy fields
the thistle springs to which the lily yields
and then a nobler prize i will resign
for sylvia charming sylvia shall be thine


cease to contend for daphnis i decree
the bowl to strephon and the lamb to thee
blest swains whose nymphs in every grace excel
blest nymphs whose swains those graces sing so well
now rise and haste to yonder woodbine bowers
a soft retreat from sudden vernal showers
the turf with rural dainties shall be crownd
while opening blooms diffuse their sweets around
for see the gathring flocks to shelter tend
and from the pleiads fruitful showers descend


a shepherds boy he seeks no better name
led forth his flocks along the silver thame
where dancing sunbeams on the waters playd
and verdant alders formd a quivering shade
soft as he mournd the streams forgot to flow
the flocks around a dumb compassion show
the naiads wept in every watery bower
and jove consented in a silent shower


accept o garth the muses early lays
that adds this wreath of ivy to thy bays
hear what from love unpractised hearts endure
from love the sole disease thou canst not cure


ye shady beeches and ye cooling streams
defence from phoebus not from cupids beams
to you i mourn nor to the deaf i sing
the woods shall answer and their echo ring
the hills and rocks attend my doleful lay
why art thou prouder and more hard than they
the bleating sheep with my complaints agree
they parchd with heat and i inflamed by thee
the sultry sirius burns the thirsty plains
while in thy heart eternal winter reigns


where stray ye muses in what lawn or grove
while your alexis pines in hopeless love
in those fair fields where sacred isis glides
or else where cam his winding vales divides
as in the crystal spring i view my face
fresh rising blushes paint the watery glass
but since those graces please thy eyes no more
i shun the fountains which i sought before
once i was skilld in every herb that grew
and every plant that drinks the morning dew
ah wretched shepherd what avails thy art
to cure thy lambs but not to heal thy heart
let other swains attend the rural care
feed fairer flocks or richer fleeces shear
but nigh yon mountain let me tune my lays
embrace my love and bind my brows with bays
that flute is mine which colins tuneful breath
inspired when living and bequeathd in death
he said alexis take this pipethe same
that taught the groves my rosalindas name
but now the reeds shall hang on yonder tree
for ever silent since despised by thee
oh were i made by some transforming power
the captive bird that sings within thy bower
then might my voice thy listening ears employ
and i those kisses he receives enjoy


and yet my numbers please the rural throng
rough satyrs dance and pan applauds the song
the nymphs forsaking every cave and spring
their early fruit and milkwhite turtles bring
each amorous nymph prefers her gifts in vain
on you their gifts are all bestowd again
for you the swains the fairest flowers design
and in one garland all their beauties join
accept the wreath which you deserve alone
in whom all beauties are comprised in one


see what delights in sylvan scenes appear
descending gods have found elysium here
in woods bright venus with adonis strayd
and chaste diana haunts the forest shade
come lovely nymph and bless the silent hours
when swains from shearing seek their nightly bowers
when weary reapers quit the sultry field
and crownd with corn their thanks to ceres yield
this harmless grove no lurking viper hides
but in my breast the serpent love abides
here bees from blossoms sip the rosy dew
but your alexis knows no sweets but you
oh deign to visit our forsaken seats
the mossy fountains and the green retreats
whereer you walk cool gales shall fan the glade
trees where you sit shall crowd into a shade
whereer you tread the blushing flowers shall rise
and all things flourish where you turn your eyes
oh how i long with you to pass my days
invoke the muses and resound your praise
your praise the birds shall chant in every grove
and winds shall waft it to the powers above
but would you sing and rival orpheus strain
the wondering forests soon should dance again
the moving mountains hear the powerful call
and headlong streams hang listening in their fall


but see the shepherds shun the noonday heat
the lowing herds to murmuring brooks retreat
to closer shades the panting flocks remove
ye gods and is there no relief for love
but soon the sun with milder rays descends
to the cool ocean where his journey ends
on me loves fiercer flames for ever prey
by night he scorches as he burns by day


beneath the shade a spreading beech displays
hylas and aegon sung their rural lays
this mournd a faithless that an absent love
and delias name and doris filld the grove
ye mantuan nymphs your sacred succour bring
hylas and aegons rural lays i sing


thou whom the nine with plautus wit inspire
the art of terence and menanders fire
whose sense instructs us and whose humour charms
whose judgment sways us and whose spirit warms
oh skilld in nature see the hearts of swains
their artless passions and their tender pains


now setting phoebus shone serenely bright
and fleecy clouds were streakd with purple light
when tuneful hylas with melodious moan
taught rocks to weep and made the mountains groan


go gentle gales and bear my sighs away
to delias ear the tender notes convey
as some sad turtle his lost love deplores
and with deep murmurs fills the sounding shores
thus far from delia to the winds i mourn
alike unheard unpitied and forlorn


go gentle gales and bear my sighs along
for her the featherd choirs neglect their song
for her the limes their pleasing shades deny
for her the lilies hang their heads and die
ye flowers that droop forsaken by the spring
ye birds that left by summer cease to sing
ye trees that fade when autumnheats remove
say is not absence death to those who love


go gentle gales and bear my sighs away
cursed be the fields that cause my delias stay
fade every blossom wither every tree
die every flower and perish all but she


what have i said whereer my delia flies
let spring attend and sudden flowers arise
let opening roses knotted oaks adorn
and liquid amber drop from every thorn


go gentle gales and bear my sighs along
the birds shall cease to tune their evening song
the winds to breathe the waving woods to move
and streams to murmur ere i cease to love
not bubbling fountains to the thirsty swain
not balmy sleep to labourers faint with pain
not showers to larks or sunshine to the bee
are half so charming as thy sight to me
go gentle gales and bear my sighs away
come delia come ah why this long delay
through rocks and caves the name of delia sounds
delia each care and echoing rock rebounds
ye powers what pleasing frenzy soothes my mind
do lovers dream or is my delia kind
she comes my delia comesnow cease my lay
and cease ye gales to bear my sighs away


next aegon sung while windsor groves admired
rehearse ye muses what yourselves inspired


resound ye hills resound my mournful strain
of perjured doris dying i complain
here where the mountains lessening as they rise
lose the low vales and steal into the skies
while labouring oxen spent with toil and heat
in their loose traces from the field retreat
while curling smokes from villagetops are seen
and the fleet shades glide oer the dusky green


resound ye hills resound my mournful lay
beneath yon poplar oft we passd the day
oft on the rind i carved her amorous vows
while she with garlands hung the bending boughs
the garlands fade the vows are worn away
so dies her love and so my hopes decay


resound ye hills resound my mournful strain
now bright arcturus glads the teeming grain
now golden fruits on loaded branches shine
and grateful clusters swell with floods of wine
now blushing berries paint the yellow grove
just gods shall all things yield returns but love


resound ye hills resound my mournful lay
the shepherds cry thy flocks are left a prey
ah what avails it me the flocks to keep
who lost my heartwhile i preserved my sheep
pan came and askd what magic caused my smart
or what ill eyes malignant glances dart
what eyes but hers alas have power to move
and is there magic but what dwells in love


resound ye hills resound my mournful strains
ill fly from shepherds flocks and flowery plains
from shepherds flocks and plains i may remove
forsake mankind and all the worldbut love
i know thee love on foreign mountains bred
wolves gave thee suck and savage tigers fed
thou wert from etnas burning entrails torn
got by fierce whirlwinds and in thunder born


resound ye hills resound my mournful lay
farewell ye woods adieu the light of day
one leap from yonder cliff shall end my pains
no more ye hills no more resound my strains


thus sung the shepherds till the approach of night
the skies yet blushing with departing light
when falling dews with spangles deckd the glade
and the low sun had lengthend every shade


thyrsis the music of that murmuring spring
is not so mournful as the strains you sing
nor rivers winding through the vales below
so sweetly warble or so smoothly flow
now sleeping flocks on their soft fleeces lie
the moon serene in glory mounts the sky
while silent birds forget their tuneful lays
oh sing of daphnes fate and daphnes praise


behold the groves that shine with silver frost
their beauty witherd and their verdure lost
here shall i try the sweet alexis strain
that calld the listening dryads to the plain
thames heard the numbers as he flowd along
and bade his willows learn the moving song


so may kind rains their vital moisture yield
and swell the future harvest of the field
begin this charge the dying daphne gave
and said ye shepherds sing around my grave
sing while beside the shaded tomb i mourn
and with fresh bays her rural shrine adorn


ye gentle muses leave your crystal spring
let nymphs and sylvans cypress garlands bring
ye weeping loves the stream with myrtles hide
and break your bows as when adonis died
and with your golden darts now useless grown
inscribe a verse on this relenting stone
let nature change let heaven and earth deplore
fair daphnes dead and love is now no more
tis done and natures various charms decay
see gloomy clouds obscure the cheerful day
now hung with pearls the dropping trees appear
their faded honours scatterd on her bier
see where on earth the flowery glories lie
with her they flourishd and with her they die
ah what avail the beauties nature wore
fair daphnes dead and beauty is no more


for her the flocks refuse their verdant food
the thirsty heifers shun the gliding flood
the silver swans her hapless fate bemoan
in notes more sad than when they sing their own
in hollow caves sweet echo silent lies
silent or only to her name replies
her name with pleasure once she taught the shore
now daphnes dead and pleasure is no more


no grateful dews descend from evening skies
nor morning odours from the flowers arise
no rich perfumes refresh the fruitful field
nor fragrant herbs their native incense yield
the balmy zephyrs silent since her death
lament the ceasing of a sweeter breath
th industrious bees neglect their golden store
fair daphnes dead and sweetness is no more


no more the mounting larks while daphne sings
shall listening in mid air suspend their wings
no more the birds shall imitate her lays
or hushd with wonder hearken from the sprays
no more the streams their murmurs shall forbear
a sweeter music than their own to hear
but tell the reeds and tell the vocal shore
fair daphnes dead and music is no more


her fate is whisperd by the gentle breeze
and told in sighs to all the trembling trees
the trembling trees in every plain and wood
her fate remurmur to the silver flood
the silver flood so lately calm appears
swelld with new passion and oerflows with tears
the winds and trees and floods her death deplore
daphne our grief our glory now no more


but see where daphne wondering mounts on high
above the clouds above the starry sky
eternal beauties grace the shining scene
fields ever fresh and groves for ever green
there while you rest in amaranthine bowers
or from those meads select unfading flowers
behold us kindly who your name implore
daphne our goddess and our grief no more


how all things listen while thy muse complains
such silence waits on philomelas strains
in some still evening when the whispering breeze
pants on the leaves and dies upon the trees
to thee bright goddess oft a lamb shall bleed
if teeming ewes increase my fleecy breed
while plants their shade or flowers their odours give
thy name thy honour and thy praise shall live


but see orion sheds unwholesome dews
arise the pines a noxious shade diffuse
sharp boreas blows and nature feels decay
time conquers all and we must time obey
adieu ye vales ye mountains streams and groves
adieu ye shepherds rural lays and loves
adieu my flocks farewell ye sylvan crew
daphne farewell and all the world adieu


ye nymphs of solyma begin the song
to heavenly themes sublimer strains belong
the mossy fountains and the sylvan shades
the dreams of pindus and the aonian maids
delight no moreo thou my voice inspire
who touchd isaiahs hallowd lips with fire


rapt into future times the bard begun
a virgin shall conceive a virgin bear a son
from jesses root behold the branch arise
whose sacred flower with fragrance fills the skies
the ethereal spirit oer its leaves shall move
and on its top descends the mystic dove
ye heavens from high the dewy nectar pour
and in soft silence shed the kindly shower
the sick and weak the healing plant shall aid
from storms a shelter and from heat a shade
all crimes shall cease and ancient fraud shall fail
returning justice lift aloft her scale
peace oer the world her olive wand extend
and whiterobed innocence from heaven descend
swift fly the years and rise the expected morn
oh spring to light auspicious babe be born
see nature hastes her earliest wreaths to bring
with all the incense of the breathing spring
see lofty lebanon his head advance
see nodding forests on the mountains dance
see spicy clouds from lowly saron rise
and carmels flowery top perfumes the skies
hark a glad voice the lonely desert cheers
prepare the way a god a god appears
a god a god the vocal hills reply
the rocks proclaim the approaching deity
lo earth receives him from the bending skies
sink down ye mountains and ye valleys rise
with heads declined ye cedars homage pay
be smooth ye rocks ye rapid floods give way
the saviour comes by ancient bards foretold
hear him ye deaf and all ye blind behold
he from thick films shall purge the visual ray
and on the sightless eyeball pour the day
tis he the obstructed paths of sound shall clear
and bid new music charm th unfolding ear
the dumb shall sing the lame his crutch forego
and leap exulting like the bounding roe
no sigh no murmur the wide world shall hear
from every face he wipes off every tear
in adamantine chains shall death be bound
and hells grim tyrant feel th eternal wound
as the good shepherd tends his fleecy care
seeks freshest pasture and the purest air
explores the lost the wandering sheep directs
by day oersees them and by night protects
the tender lambs he raises in his arms
feeds from his hand and in his bosom warms
thus shall mankind his guardian care engage
the promised father of the future age
no more shall nation against nation rise
nor ardent warriors meet with hateful eyes
nor fields with gleaming steel be coverd oer
the brazen trumpets kindle rage no more
but useless lances into scythes shall bend
and the broad falchion in a ploughshare end
then palaces shall rise the joyful son
shall finish what his shortlived sire begun
their vines a shadow to their race shall yield
and the same hand that sowd shall reap the field
the swain in barren deserts with surprise
see lilies spring and sudden verdure rise
and start amidst the thirsty wilds to hear
new falls of water murmuring in his ear
on rifted rocks the dragons late abodes
the green reed trembles and the bulrush nods
waste sandy valleys once perplexd with thorn
the spiry fir and shapely box adorn
to leafless shrubs the flowering palms succeed
and odorous myrtle to the noisome weed
the lambs with wolves shall graze the verdant mead
and boys in flowery bands the tiger lead
the steer and lion at one crib shall meet
and harmless serpents lick the pilgrims feet
the smiling infant in his hand shall take
the crested basilisk and speckled snake
pleased the green lustre of the scales survey
and with their forky tongue shall innocently play
rise crownd with light imperial salem rise
exalt thy towery head and lift thy eyes
see a long race thy spacious courts adorn
see future sons and daughters yet unborn
in crowding ranks on every side arise
demanding life impatient for the skies
see barbarous nations at thy gates attend
walk in thy light and in thy temple bend
see thy bright altars throngd with prostrate kings
and heapd with products of sabean springs
for thee idumes spicy forests blow
and seeds of gold in ophirs mountains glow
see heaven its sparkling portals wide display
and break upon thee in a flood of day
no more the rising sun shall gild the morn
nor evening cynthia fill her silver horn
but lost dissolved in thy superior rays
one tide of glory one unclouded blaze
oerflow thy courts the light himself shall shine
reveald and gods eternal day be thine
the seas shall waste the skies in smoke decay
rocks fall to dust and mountains melt away
but fixd his word his saving power remains
thy realm for ever lasts thy own messiah reigns


thy forests windsor and thy green retreats
at once the monarchs and the muses seats
invite my lays be present sylvan maids
unlock your springs and open all your shades
granville commands your aid o muses bring
what muse for granville can refuse to sing


the groves of eden vanishd now so long
live in description and look green in song
these were my breast inspired with equal flame
like them in beauty should be like in fame
here hills and vales the woodland and the plain
here earth and water seem to strive again
not chaoslike together crushd and bruised
but as the world harmoniously confused
where order in variety we see
and where though all things differ all agree
here waving groves a chequerd scene display
and part admit and part exclude the day
as some coy nymph her lovers warm address
nor quite indulges nor can quite repress
there interspersed in lawns and opening glades
thin trees arise that shun each others shades
here in full light the russet plains extend
there wrapt in clouds the bluish hills ascend
evn the wild heath displays her purple dyes
and midst the desert fruitful fields arise
that crownd with tufted trees and springing corn
like verdant isles the sable waste adorn
let india boast her plants nor envy we
the weeping amber or the balmy tree
while by our oaks the precious loads are born
and realms commanded which those trees adorn
not proud olympus yields a nobler sight
though gods assembled grace his towering height
than what more humble mountains offer here
where in their blessings all those gods appear
see pan with flocks with fruits pomona crownd
here blushing flora paints the enamelld ground
here ceres gifts in waving prospect stand
and nodding tempt the joyful reapers hand
rich industry sits smiling on the plains
and peace and plenty tell a stuart reigns


not thus the land appeard in ages past
a dreary desert and a gloomy waste
to savage beasts and savage laws a prey
and kings more furious and severe than they
who claimd the skies dispeopled air and floods
the lonely lords of empty wilds and woods
cities laid waste they stormd the dens and caves
for wiser brutes were backward to be slaves
what could be free when lawless beasts obeyd
and even the elements a tyrant swayd
in vain kind seasons swelld the teeming grain
soft showers distilld and suns grew warm in vain
the swain with tears his frustrate labour yields
and famishd dies amidst his ripend fields
what wonder then a beast or subject slain
were equal crimes in a despotic reign
both doomd alike for sportive tyrants bled
but while the subject starved the beast was fed
proud nimrod first the bloody chase began
a mighty hunter and his prey was man
our haughty norman boasts that barbarous name
and makes his trembling slaves the royal game
the fields are ravishd from the industrious swains
from men their cities and from gods their fanes
the levelld towns with weeds lie coverd oer
the hollow winds through naked temples roar
round broken columns clasping ivy twined
oer heaps of ruin stalkd the stately hind
the fox obscene to gaping tombs retires
and savage howlings fill the sacred choirs
awed by his nobles by his commons cursed
the oppressor ruled tyrannic where he durst
stretchd oer the poor and church his iron rod
and served alike his vassals and his god
whom even the saxon spared and bloody dane
the wanton victims of his sport remain
but see the man who spacious regions gave
a waste for beasts himself denied a grave
stretchd on the lawn his second hope survey
at once the chaser and at once the prey
lo rufus tugging at the deadly dart
bleeds in the forest like a wounded hart
succeeding monarchs heard the subjects cries
nor saw displeased the peaceful cottage rise
then gathering flocks on unknown mountains fed
oer sandy wilds were yellow harvests spread
the forests wonderd at the unusual grain
and secret transport touchd the conscious swain
fair liberty britannias goddess rears
her cheerful head and leads the golden years


ye vigorous swains while youth ferments your blood
and purer spirits swell the sprightly flood
now range the hills the gameful woods beset
wind the shrill horn or spread the waving net
when milder autumn summers heat succeeds
and in the newshorn field the partridge feeds
before his lord the ready spaniel bounds
panting with hope he tries the furrowd grounds
but when the tainted gales the game betray
couchd close he lies and meditates the prey
secure they trust the unfaithful field beset
till hovering oer em sweeps the swelling net
thus if small things we may with great compare
when albion sends her eager sons to war
some thoughtless town with ease and plenty blest
near and more near the closing lines invest
sudden they seize the amazed defenceless prize
and high in air britannias standard flies


see from the brake the whirring pheasant springs
and mounts exulting on triumphant wings
short is his joy he feels the fiery wound
flutters in blood and panting beats the ground
ah what avail his glossy varying dyes
his purple crest and scarletcircled eyes
the vivid green his shining plumes unfold
his painted wings and breast that flames with gold


nor yet when moist arcturus clouds the sky
the woods and fields their pleasing toils deny
to plains with wellbreathd beagles we repair
and trace the mazes of the circling hare
beasts urged by us their fellowbeasts pursue
and learn of man each other to undo
with slaughtering gun the unwearied fowler roves
when frosts have whitend all the naked groves
where doves in flocks the leafless trees oershade
and lonely woodcocks haunt the watery glade
he lifts the tube and levels with his eye
straight a short thunder breaks the frozen sky
oft as in airy rings they skim the heath
the clamorous lapwings feel the leaden death
oft as the mounting larks their notes prepare
they fall and leave their little lives in air


in genial spring beneath the quivering shade
where cooling vapours breathe along the mead
the patient fisher takes his silent stand
intent his angle trembling in his hand
with looks unmoved he hopes the scaly breed
and eyes the dancing cork and bending reed
our plenteous streams a various race supply
the brighteyed perch with fins of tyrian dye
the silver eel in shining volumes rolld
the yellow carp in scales bedroppd with gold
swift trouts diversified with crimson stains
and pikes the tyrants of the watery plains


now cancer glows with phoebus fiery car
the youth rush eager to the sylvan war
swarm oer the lawns the forest walks surround
rouse the fleet hart and cheer the opening hound
the impatient courser pants in every vein
and pawing seems to beat the distant plain
hills vales and floods appear already crossd
and ere he starts a thousand steps are lost
see the bold youth strain up the threatening steep
rush through the thickets down the valleys sweep
hang oer their coursers heads with eager speed
and earth rolls back beneath the flying steed
let old arcadia boast her ample plain
the immortal huntress and her virgintrain
nor envy windsor since thy shades have seen
as bright a goddess and as chaste a queen
whose care like hers protects the sylvan reign
the earths fair light and empress of the main


here too tis sung of old diana strayd
and cynthus top forsook for windsor shade
here was she seen oer airy wastes to rove
seek the clear spring or haunt the pathless grove
here armd with silver bows in early dawn
her buskind virgins traced the dewy lawn


above the rest a rural nymph was famed
thy offspring thames the fair lodona named
lodonas fate in long oblivion cast
the muse shall sing and what she sings shall last
scarce could the goddess from her nymph be known
but by the crescent and the golden zone
she scornd the praise of beauty and the care
a belt her waist a fillet binds her hair
a painted quiver on her shoulder sounds
and with her dart the flying deer she wounds
it chanced as eager of the chase the maid
beyond the forests verdant limits strayd
pan saw and loved and burning with desire
pursued her flight her flight increased his fire
not half so swift the trembling doves can fly
when the fierce eagle cleaves the liquid sky
not half so swiftly the fierce eagle moves
when through the clouds he drives the trembling doves
as from the god she flew with furious pace
or as the god more furious urged the chase
now fainting sinking pale the nymph appears
now close behind his sounding steps she hears
and now his shadow reachd her as she run
his shadow lengthend by the setting sun
and now his shorter breath with sultry air
pants on her neck and fans her parting hair
in vain on father thames she calls for aid
nor could diana help her injured maid
faint breathless thus she prayd nor prayd in vain
ah cynthia ahthough banishd from thy train
let me oh let me to the shades repair
my native shadesthere weep and murmur there
she said and melting as in tears she lay
in a soft silver stream dissolved away
the silver stream her virgin coldness keeps
for ever murmurs and for ever weeps
still bears the name the hapless virgin bore
and bathes the forest where she ranged before
in her chaste current oft the goddess laves
and with celestial tears augments the waves
oft in her glass the musing shepherd spies
the headlong mountains and the downward skies
the watery landscape of the pendent woods
and absent trees that tremble in the floods
in the clear azure gleam the flocks are seen
and floating forests paint the waves with green
through the fair scene roll slow the lingering streams
then foaming pour along and rush into the thames


thou too great father of the british floods
with joyful pride surveyst our lofty woods
where towering oaks their growing honours rear
and future navies on thy shores appear
not neptunes self from all her streams receives
a wealthier tribute than to thine he gives
no seas so rich so gay no banks appear
no lake so gentle and no spring so clear
nor po so swells the fabling poets lays
while led along the skies his current strays
as thine which visits windsors famed abodes
to grace the mansion of our earthly gods
nor all his stars above a lustre show
like the bright beauties on thy banks below
where jove subdued by mortal passion still
might change olympus for a nobler hill


happy the man whom this bright court approves
his sovereign favours and his country loves
happy next him who to these shades retires
whom nature charms and whom the muse inspires
whom humbler joys of homefelt quiet please
successive study exercise and ease
he gathers health from herbs the forest yields
and of their fragrant physic spoils the fields
with chemic art exalts the mineral powers
and draws the aromatic souls of flowers
now marks the course of rolling orbs on high
oer figured worlds now travels with his eye
of ancient writ unlocks the learned store
consults the dead and lives past ages oer
or wandering thoughtful in the silent wood
attends the duties of the wise and good
to observe a mean be to himself a friend
to follow nature and regard his end
or looks on heaven with more than mortal eyes
bids his free soul expatiate in the skies
amid her kindred stars familiar roam
survey the region and confess her home
such was the life great scipio once admired
thus atticus and trumbull thus retired


ye sacred nine that all my soul possess
whose raptures fire me and whose visions bless
bear me oh bear me to sequesterd scenes
the bowery mazes and surrounding greens
to thamess banks which fragrant breezes fill
or where ye muses sport on coopers hill
on coopers hill eternal wreaths shall grow
while lasts the mountain or while thames shall flow
i seem through consecrated walks to rove
i hear soft music die along the grove
led by the sound i roam from shade to shade
by godlike poets venerable made
here his first lays majestic denham sung
there the last numbers flowd from cowleys tongue
oh early lost what tears the river shed
when the sad pomp along his banks was led
his drooping swans on every note expire
and on his willows hung each muses lyre


since fate relentless stoppd their heavenly voice
no more the forests ring or groves rejoice
who now shall charm the shades where cowley strung
his living harp and lofty denham sung
but hark the groves rejoice the forest rings
are these revived or is it granville sings
tis yours my lord to bless our soft retreats
and call the muses to their ancient seats
to paint anew the flowery sylvan scenes
to crown the forest with immortal greens
make windsor hills in lofty numbers rise
and lift her turrets nearer to the skies
to sing those honours you deserve to wear
and add new lustre to her silver star


here noble surrey felt the sacred rage
surrey the granville of a former age
matchless his pen victorious was his lance
bold in the lists and graceful in the dance
in the same shades the cupids tuned his lyre
to the same notes of love and soft desire
fair geraldine bright object of his vow
then filld the groves as heavenly mira now


oh wouldst thou sing what heroes windsor bore
what kings first breathed upon her winding shore
or raise old warriors whose adored remains
in weeping vaults her hallowd earth contains
with edwards acts adorn the shining page
stretch his long triumphs down through every age
draw monarchs chaind and cressys glorious field
the lilies blazing on the regal shield
then from her roofs when verrios colours fall
and leave inanimate the naked wall
still in thy song should vanquishd france appear
and bleed for ever under britains spear


let softer strains illfated henry mourn
and palms eternal flourish round his urn
here oer the martyrking the marble weeps
and fast beside him oncefeard edward sleeps
whom not the extended albion could contain
from old belerium to the northern main
the grave unites where evn the great find rest
and blended lie the oppressor and the oppressd


make sacred charles tomb for ever known
obscure the place and uninscribed the stone
oh fact accursed what tears has albion shed
heavens what new wounds and how her old have bled
she saw her sons with purple deaths expire
her sacred domes involved in rolling fire
a dreadful series of intestine wars
inglorious triumphs and dishonest scars
at length great anna saidlet discord cease
she said the world obeyd and all was peace


in that blest moment from his oozy bed
old father thames advanced his reverend head
his tresses droppd with dews and oer the stream
his shining horns diffused a golden gleam
graved on his urn appeard the moon that guides
his swelling waters and alternate tides
the figured streams in waves of silver rolld
and on their banks augusta rose in gold
around his throne the seaborn brothers stood
who swell with tributary urns his flood
first the famed authors of his ancient name
the winding isis and the fruitful thame
the kennet swift for silver eels renownd
the loddon slow with verdant alders crownd
cole whose dark streams his flowery islands lave
and chalky wey that rolls a milky wave
the blue transparent vandalis appears
the gulfy lee his sedgy tresses rears
and sullen mole that hides his diving flood
and silent darent staind with danish blood


high in the midst upon his urn reclined
his seagreen mantle waving with the wind
the god appeard he turnd his azure eyes
where windsordomes and pompous turrets rise
then bowd and spoke the winds forget to roar
and the hushd waves glide softly to the shore


hail sacred peace hail longexpected days
that thamess glory to the stars shall raise
though tibers streams immortal rome behold
though foaming hermus swells with tides of gold
from heaven itself though sevenfold nilus flows
and harvests on a hundred realms bestows
these now no more shall be the muses themes
lost in my fame as in the sea their streams
let volgas banks with iron squadrons shine
and groves of lances glitter on the rhine
let barbarous ganges arm a servile train
be mine the blessings of a peaceful reign
no more my sons shall dye with british blood
red ibers sands or isters foaming flood
safe on my shore each unmolested swain
shall tend the flocks or reap the bearded grain
the shady empire shall retain no trace
of war or blood but in the sylvan chase
the trumpet sleep while cheerful horns are blown
and arms employd on birds and beasts alone
behold the ascending villas on my side
project long shadows oer the crystal tide
behold augustas glittering spires increase
and temples rise the beauteous works of peace
i see i see where two fair cities bend
their ample bow a new whitehall ascend
there mighty nations shall inquire their doom
the worlds great oracle in times to come
there kings shall sue and suppliant states be seen
once more to bend before a british queen


thy trees fair windsor now shall leave their woods
and half thy forests rush into the floods
bear britains thunder and her cross display
to the bright regions of the rising day
tempt icy seas where scarce the waters roll
where clearer flames glow round the frozen pole
or under southern skies exalt their sails
led by new stars and borne by spicy gales
for me the balm shall bleed and amber flow
the coral redden and the ruby glow
the pearly shell its lucid globe infold
and phoebus warm the ripening ore to gold
the time shall come when free as seas or wind
unbounded thames shall flow for all mankind
whole nations enter with each swelling tide
and seas but join the regions they divide
earths distant ends our glory shall behold
and the new world launch forth to seek the old
then ships of uncouth form shall stem the tide
and featherd people crowd my wealthy side
and naked youths and painted chiefs admire
our speech our colour and our strange attire
o stretch thy reign fair peace from shore to shore
till conquest cease and slavery be no more
till the freed indians in their native groves
reap their own fruits and woo their sable loves
peru once more a race of kings behold
and other mexicos be roofd with gold
exiled by thee from earth to deepest hell
in brazen bonds shall barbarous discord dwell
gigantic pride pale terror gloomy care
and mad ambition shall attend her there
there purple vengeance bathed in gore retires
her weapons blunted and extinct her fires
there hateful envy her own snakes shall feel
and persecution mourn her broken wheel
there faction roar rebellion bite her chain
and gasping furies thirst for blood in vain


here cease thy flight nor with unhallowd lays
touch the fair fame of albions golden days
the thoughts of gods let granvilles verse recite
and bring the scenes of opening fate to light
my humble muse in unambitious strains
paints the green forests and the flowery plains
where peace descending bids her olives spring
and scatters blessings from her dovelike wing
evn i more sweetly pass my careless days
pleased in the silent shade with empty praise
enough for me that to the listening swains
first in these fields i sung the sylvan strains


descend ye nine descend and sing
the breathing instruments inspire
wake into voice each silent string
and sweep the sounding lyre


in a sadlypleasing strain
let the warbling lute complain
let the loud trumpet sound
till the roofs all around
the shrill echoes rebound
while in more lengthend notes and slow
the deep majestic solemn organs blow
hark the numbers soft and clear
gently steal upon the ear
now louder and yet louder rise
and fill with spreading sounds the skies
exulting in triumph now swell the bold notes
in broken air trembling the wild music floats
till by degrees remote and small
the strains decay
and melt away
in a dying dying fall


by music minds an equal temper know
nor swell too high nor sink too low
if in the breast tumultuous joys arise
music her soft assuasive voice applies
or when the soul is pressd with cares
exalts her in enlivening airs
warriors she fires with animated sounds
pours balm into the bleeding lovers wounds
melancholy lifts her head
morpheus rouses from his bed
sloth unfolds her arms and wakes
listening envy drops her snakes
intestine war no more our passions wage
and giddy factions hear away their rage


but when our countrys cause provokes to arms
how martial music every bosom warms


so when the first bold vessel dared the seas
high on the stern the thracian raised his strain
while argo saw her kindred trees
descend from pelion to the main
transported demigods stood round
and men grew heroes at the sound
inflamed with glorys charms
each chief his sevenfold shield displayd
and half unsheathd the shining blade
and seas and rocks and skies rebound
to arms to arms to arms


but when through all the infernal bounds
which flaming phlegethon surrounds
love strong as death the poet led
to the pale nations of the dead
what sounds were heard
what scenes appeard


oer all the dreary coasts
dreadful gleams
dismal screams
fires that glow
shrieks of woe
sullen moans
hollow groans
and cries of tortured ghosts


but hark he strikes the golden lyre
and see the tortured ghosts respire
see shady forms advance
thy stone o sisyphus stands still
ixion rests upon his wheel
and the pale spectres dance
the furies sink upon their iron beds
and snakes uncurld hang listening round their heads


by the streams that ever flow
by the fragrant winds that blow
oer the elysian flowers
by those happy souls who dwell
in yellow meads of asphodel
or amaranthine bowers
by the heros armed shades
glittering through the gloomy glades
by the youths that died for love
wandering in the myrtle grove
restore restore eurydice to life
oh take the husband or return the wife


he sung and hell consented
to hear the poets prayer
stern proserpine relented
and gave him back the fair
thus song could prevail
oer death and oer hell
a conquest how hard and how glorious
though fate had fast bound her
with styx nine times round her
yet music and love were victorious


but soon too soon the lover turns his eyes
again she falls again she dies she dies
how wilt thou now the fatal sisters move
no crime was thine if tis no crime to love
now under hanging mountains
beside the falls of fountains
or where hebrus wanders
rolling in meanders


all alone
unheard unknown
he makes his moan


and calls her ghost
for ever ever ever lost
now with furies surrounded
despairing confounded
he trembles he glows
amidst rhodopes snows


see wild as the winds oer the desert he flies
hark haemus resounds with the bacchanals cries
ah see he dies


yet even in death eurydice he sung
eurydice still trembled on his tongue
eurydice the woods
eurydice the floods
eurydice the rocks and hollow mountains rung


music the fiercest grief can charm
and fates severest rage disarm
music can soften pain to ease
and make despair and madness please
our joys below it can improve
and antedate the bliss above
this the divine cecilia found
and to her makers praise confined the sound


when the full organ joins the tuneful choir
the immortal powers incline their ear
borne on the swelling notes our souls aspire
while solemn airs improve the sacred fire
and angels lean from heaven to hear


of orpheus now no more let poets tell
to bright cecilia greater power is given
his numbers raised a shade from hell
hers lift the soul to heaven


ye shades where sacred truth is sought
groves where immortal sages taught
where heavenly visions plato fired
and epicurus lay inspired
in vain your guiltless laurels stood
unspotted long with human blood
war horrid war your thoughtful walks invades
and steel now glitters in the muses shades


o heavenborn sisters source of art
who charm the sense or mend the heart
who lead fair virtues train along
moral truth and mystic song
to what new clime what distant sky
forsaken friendless shall ye fly
say will ye bless the bleak atlantic shore
or bid the furious gaul be rude no more


when athens sinks by fates unjust
when wild barbarians spurn her dust
perhaps even britains utmost shore
shall cease to blush with strangers gore
see arts her savage sons control
and athens rising near the pole
till some new tyrant lifts his purple hand
and civil madness tears them from the land


ye gods what justice rules the ball
freedom and arts together fall
fools grant whateer ambition craves
and men once ignorant are slaves
oh cursed effects of civil hate
in every age in every state
still when the lust of tyrant power succeeds
some athens perishes some tully bleeds


o tyrant love hast thou possessd
the prudent learnd and virtuous breast
wisdom and wit in vain reclaim
and arts but soften us to feel thy flame
love soft intruder enters here
but entering learns to be sincere
marcus with blushes owns he loves
and brutus tenderly reproves


why virtue dost thou blame desire
which nature has impressd
why nature dost thou soonest fire
the mild and generous breast


loves purer flames the gods approve
the gods and brutus bend to love
brutus for absent portia sighs
and sterner cassius melts at junias eyes
what is loose love a transient gust
spent in a sudden storm of lust
a vapour fed from wild desire
a wandering selfconsuming fire


but hymens kinder flames unite
and burn for ever one
chaste as cold cynthias virgin light
productive as the sun


oh source of every social tie
united wish and mutual joy
what various joys on one attend
as son as father brother husband friend
whether his hoary sire he spies
while thousand grateful thoughts arise
or meets his spouses fonder eye
or views his smiling progeny


what tender passions take their turns
what homefelt raptures move
his heart now melts now leaps now burns
with reverence hope and love


hence guilty joys distastes surmises
hence false tears deceits disguises
dangers doubts delays surprises
fires that scorch yet dare not shine
purest loves unwasting treasure
constant faith fair hope long leisure
days of ease and nights of pleasure
sacred hymen these are thine


begone ye critics and restrain your spite
codrus writes on and will for ever write
the heaviest muse the swiftest course has gone
as clocks run fastest when most lead is on
what though no bees around your cradle flew
nor on your lips distilld the golden dew
yet have we oft discoverd in their stead
a swarm of drones that buzzd about your head
when you like orpheus strike the warbling lyre
attentive blocks stand round you and admire
wit passd through thee no longer is the same
as meat digested takes a different name
but sense must sure thy safest plunder be
since no reprisals can be made on thee
thus thou mayst rise and in thy daring flight
though neer so weighty reach a wondrous height
so forced from engines lead itself can fly
and ponderous slugs move nimbly through the sky
sure bavius copied maevius to the full
and chaerilus taught codrus to be dull
therefore dear friend at my advice give oer
this needless labour and contend no more
to prove a _dull succession_ to be true
since tis enough we find it so in you


vital spark of heavenly flame
quit oh quit this mortal frame
trembling hoping lingering flying
oh the pain the bliss of dying
cease fond nature cease thy strife
and let me languish into life


hark they whisper angels say
sister spirit come away
what is this absorbs me quite
steals my senses shuts my sight
drowns my spirits draws my breath
tell me my soul can this be death


the world recedes it disappears
heaven opens on my eyes my ears
with sounds seraphic ring
lend lend your wings i mount i fly
o grave where is thy victory
o death where is thy sting


what beckoning ghost along the moonlight shade
invites my steps and points to yonder glade
tis shebut why that bleeding bosom gored
why dimly gleams the visionary sword
oh ever beauteous ever friendly tell
is it in heaven a crime to love too well
to bear too tender or too firm a heart
to act a lovers or a romans part
is there no bright reversion in the sky
for those who greatly think or bravely die


why bade ye else ye powers her soul aspire
above the vulgar flight of low desire
ambition first sprung from your blest abodes
the glorious fault of angels and of gods
thence to their images on earth it flows
and in the breasts of kings and heroes glows
most souls tis true but peep out once an age
dull sullen prisoners in the bodys cage
dim lights of life that burn a length of years
useless unseen as lamps in sepulchres
like eastern kings a lazy state they keep
and close confined to their own palace sleep


from these perhaps ere nature bade her die
fate snatchd her early to the pitying sky
as into air the purer spirits flow
and separate from their kindred dregs below
so flew the soul to its congenial place
nor left one virtue to redeem her race


but thou false guardian of a charge too good
thou mean deserter of thy brothers blood
see on these ruby lips the trembling breath
these cheeks now fading at the blast of death
cold is that breast which warmd the world before
and those lovedarting eyes must roll no more
thus if eternal justice rules the ball
thus shall your wives and thus your children fall
on all the line a sudden vengeance waits
and frequent hearses shall besiege your gates
there passengers shall stand and pointing say
while the long funerals blacken all the way
lo these were they whose souls the furies steeld
and cursed with hearts unknowing how to yield
thus unlamented pass the proud away
the gaze of fools and pageant of a day
so perish all whose breast neer learnd to glow
for others good or melt at others woe


what can atone o everinjured shade
thy fate unpitied and thy rites unpaid
no friends complaint no kind domestic tear
pleased thy pale ghost or graced thy mournful bier
by foreign hands thy dying eyes were closed
by foreign hands thy decent limbs composed
by foreign hands thy humble grave adornd
by strangers honourd and by strangers mournd
what though no friends in sable weeds appear
grieve for an hour perhaps then mourn a year
and bear about the mockery of woe
to midnight dances and the public show
what though no weeping loves thy ashes grace
nor polishd marble emulate thy face
what though no sacred earth allow thee room
nor hallowd dirge be mutterd oer thy tomb
yet shall thy grave with rising flowers be dressd
and the green turf lie lightly on thy breast
there shall the morn her earliest tears bestow
there the first roses of the year shall blow
while angels with their silver wings oershade
the ground now sacred by thy relics made


so peaceful rests without a stone a name
what once had beauty titles wealth and fame
how loved how honourd once avails thee not
to whom related or by whom begot
a heap of dust alone remains of thee
tis all thou art and all the proud shall be


poets themselves must fall like those they sung
deaf the praised ear and mute the tuneful tongue
even he whose soul now melts in mournful lays
shall shortly want the generous tear he pays
then from his closing eyes thy form shall part
and the last pang shall tear thee from his heart
lifes idle business at one gasp be oer
the muse forgot and thou beloved no more


to wake the soul by tender strokes of art
to raise the genius and to mend the heart
to make mankind in conscious virtue bold
live oer each scene and be what they behold
for this the tragic muse first trod the stage
commanding tears to stream through every age
tyrants no more their savage nature kept
and foes to virtue wonderd how they wept
our author shuns by vulgar springs to move
the heros glory or the virgins love
in pitying love we but our weakness show
and wild ambition well deserves its woe
here tears shall flow from a more generous cause
such tears as patriots shed for dying laws
he bids your breasts with ancient ardour rise
and calls forth roman drops from british eyes


virtue confessd in human shape he draws
what plato thought and godlike cato was
no common object to your sight displays
but what with pleasure heaven itself surveys
a brave man struggling in the storms of fate
and greatly falling with a falling state
while cato gives his little senate laws
what bosom beats not in his countrys cause
who sees him act but envies every deed
who hears him groan and does not wish to bleed


even when proud caesar midst triumphal cars
the spoils of nations and the pomp of wars
ignobly vain and impotently great
showd rome her catos figure drawn in state
as her dead fathers reverend image passd
the pomp was darkend and the day oercast
the triumph ceased tears gushd from every eye
the worlds great victor passd unheeded by
her last good man dejected rome adored
and honourd caesars less than catos sword


britons attend be worth like this approved
and show you have the virtue to be moved
with honest scorn the first famed cato viewd
rome learning arts from greece whom she subdued
your scene precariously subsists too long
on french translation and italian song
dare to have sense yourselves assert the stage
be justly warmd with your own native rage
such plays alone should win a british ear
as catos self had not disdaind to hear


in that soft season when descending showers
call forth the greens and wake the rising flowers
when opening buds salute the welcome day
and earth relenting feels the genial ray
as balmy sleep had charmd my cares to rest
and love itself was banishd from my breast
what time the morn mysterious visions brings
while purer slumbers spread their golden wings
a train of phantoms in wild order rose
and joind this intellectual scene compose


i stood methought betwixt earth seas and skies
the whole creation open to my eyes
in air selfbalanced hung the globe below
where mountains rise and circling oceans flow
here naked rocks and empty wastes were seen
there towery cities and the forests green
here sailing ships delight the wandering eyes
there trees and intermingled temples rise
now a clear sun the shining scene displays
the transient landscape now in clouds decays


oer the wide prospect as i gazed around
sudden i heard a wild promiscuous sound
like broken thunders that at distance roar
or billows murmuring on the hollow shore
then gazing up a glorious pile beheld
whose towering summit ambient clouds conceald
high on a rock of ice the structure lay
steep its ascent and slippery was the way
the wondrous rock like parian marble shone
and seemd to distant sight of solid stone


inscriptions here of various names i viewd
the greater part by hostile time subdued
yet wide was spread their fame in ages past
and poets once had promised they should last
some fresh engraved appeard of wits renownd
i lookd again nor could their trace be found
critics i saw that other names deface
and fix their own with labour in their place
their own like others soon their place resignd
or disappeard and left the first behind
nor was the work impaird by storms alone
but felt the approaches of too warm a sun


for fame impatient of extremes decays
not more by envy than excess of praise
yet part no injuries of heaven could feel
like crystal faithful to the graving steel
the rocks high summit in the temples shade
nor heat could melt nor beating storm invade
their names inscribed unnumberd ages past
from times first birth with time itself shall last
these ever new nor subject to decays
spread and grow brighter with the length of days


so zemblas rocks the beauteous work of frost
rise white in air and glitter oer the coast
pale suns unfelt at distance roll away
and on the impassive ice the lightnings play
eternal snows the growing mass supply
till the bright mountains prop the incumbent sky
as atlas fixd each hoary pile appears
the gatherd winter of a thousand years


on this foundation fames high temple stands
stupendous pile not reard by mortal hands
whateer proud rome or artful greece beheld
or elder babylon its frame excelld
four faces had the dome and every face
of various structure but of equal grace


four brazen gates on columns lifted high
salute the different quarters of the sky
here fabled chiefs in darker ages born
or worthies old whom arms or arts adorn
who cities raised or tamed a monstrous race
the walls in venerable order grace
heroes in animated marble frown
and legislators seem to think in stone


westward a sumptuous frontispiece appeard
on doric pillars of white marble reard
crownd with an architrave of antique mould
and sculpture rising on the roughend gold
in shaggy spoils here theseus was beheld
and perseus dreadful with minervas shield
there great alcides stooping with his toil
rests on his club and holds th hesperian spoil
here orpheus sings trees moving to the sound
start from their roots and form a shade around


amphion there the loud creating lyre
strikes and behold a sudden thebes aspire
cythaerons echoes answer to his call
and half the mountain rolls into a wall
there might you see the lengthening spires ascend
the domes swell up the widening arches bend
the growing towers like exhalations rise
and the huge columns heave into the skies


the eastern front was glorious to behold
with diamond flaming and barbaric gold
there ninus shone who spread the assyrian fame
and the great founder of the persian name
there in long robes the royal magi stand
grave zoroaster waves the circling wand
the sage chaldeans robed in white appeard
and brachmans deep in desert woods revered


these stoppd the moon and calld the unbodied shades
to midnight banquets in the glimmering glades
made visionary fabrics round them rise
and airy spectres skim before their eyes
of talismans and sigils knew the power
and careful watchd the planetary hour
superior and alone confucius stood
who taught that useful scienceto be good


but on the south a long majestic race
of egypts priests the gilded niches grace
who measured earth described the starry spheres
and traced the long records of lunar years
high on his car sesostris struck my view
whom sceptred slaves in golden harness drew
his hands a bow and pointed javelin hold
his giant limbs are armd in scales of gold
between the statues obelisks were placed
and the learnd walls with hieroglyphics graced


of gothic structure was the northern side
oerwrought with ornaments of barbarous pride
there huge colosses rose with trophies crownd
and runic characters were graved around
there sat zamolxis with erected eyes
and odin here in mimic trances dies
there on rude iron columns smeard with blood
the horrid forms of seythian heroes stood


druids and bards their once loud harps unstrung
and youths that died to be by poets sung
these and a thousand more of doubtful fame
to whom old fables gave a lasting name
in ranks adornd the temples outward face
the wall in lustre and effect like glass
which oer each object casting various dyes
enlarges some and others multiplies
nor void of emblem was the mystic wall
for thus romantic fame increases all


the temple shakes the sounding gates unfold
wide vaults appear and roofs of fretted gold
raised on a thousand pillars wreathed around
with laurel foliage and with eagles crownd
of bright transparent beryl were the walls
the friezes gold and gold the capitals
as heaven with stars the roof with jewels glows
and everliving lamps depend in rows
full in the passage of each spacious gate
the sage historians in white garments wait


graved oer their seats the form of time was found
his scythe reversed and both his pinions bound
within stood heroes who through loud alarms
in bloody fields pursued renown in arms
high on a throne with trophies charged i viewd
the youth that all things but himself subdued
his feet on sceptres and tiaras trod
and his hornd head belied the libyan god
there caesar graced with both minervas shone
caesar the worlds great master and his own
unmoved superior still in every state
and scarce detested in his countrys fate


but chief were those who not for empire fought
but with their toils their peoples safety bought
high oer the rest epaminondas stood
timoleon glorious in his brothers blood
bold scipio saviour of the roman state
great in his triumphs in retirement great


and wise aurelius in whose welltaught mind
with boundless power unbounded virtue joind
his own strict judge and patron of mankind


muchsuffering heroes next their honours claim
those of less noisy and less guilty fame
fair virtues silent train supreme of these
here ever shines the godlike socrates
he whom ungrateful athens could expel
at all times just but when he signd the shell
here his abode the martyrd phocion claims
with agis not the last of spartan names
unconquerd cato shows the wound he tore
and brutus his ill genius meets no more


but in the centre of the hallowd choir
six pompous columns oer the rest aspire
around the shrine itself of fame they stand
hold the chief honours and the fane command
high on the first the mighty homer shone
eternal adamant composed his throne
father of verse in holy fillets dressd
his silver beard waved gently oer his breast
though blind a boldness in his looks appears
in years he seemd but not impaird by years
the wars of troy were round the pillar seen
here fierce tydides wounds the cyprian queen


here hector glorious from patroclus fall
here draggd in triumph round the trojan wall
motion and life did every part inspire
bold was the work and proved the masters fire
a strong expression most he seemd to affect
and here and there disclosed a brave neglect


a golden column next in rank appeard
on which a shrine of purest gold was reard
finishd the whole and labourd every part
with patient touches of unwearied art
the mantuan there in sober triumph sate
composed his posture and his look sedate
on homer still he fixd a reverend eye
great without pride in modest majesty


in living sculpture on the sides were spread
the latian wars and haughty turnus dead
eliza stretchd upon the funeral pyre
aeneas bending with his aged sire
troy flamed in burning gold and oer the throne
arms and the man in golden cyphers shone


four swans sustain a car of silver bright
with heads advanced and pinions stretchd for flight
here like some furious prophet pindar rode
and seemd to labour with the inspiring god
across the harp a careless hand he flings
and boldly sinks into the sounding strings


the figured games of greece the column grace
neptune and jove survey the rapid race
the youths hang oer their chariots as they run
the fiery steeds seem starting from the stone
the champions in distorted postures threat
and all appeard irregularly great


here happy horace tuned the ausonian lyre
to sweeter sounds and temperd pindars fire
pleased with alcaeus manly rage t infuse
the softer spirit of the sapphic muse
the polishd pillar different sculptures grace
a work outlasting monumental brass
here smiling loves and bacchanals appear
the julian star and great augustus here
the doves that round the infant poet spread
myrtles and bays hung hovering oer his head


here in a shrine that cast a dazzling light
sat fixd in thought the mighty stagyrite
his sacred head a radiant zodiac crownd
and various animals his side surround
his piercing eyes erect appear to view
superior worlds and look all nature through


with equal rays immortal tully shone
the roman rostra deckd the consuls throne
gathering his flowing robe he seemd to stand
in act to speak and graceful stretchd his hand
behind romes genius waits with civic crowns
and the great father of his country owns


these massy columns in a circle rise
oer which a pompous dome invades the skies
scarce to the top i stretchd my aching sight
so large it spread and swelld to such a height
full in the midst proud fames imperial seat
with jewels blazed magnificently great
the vivid emeralds there revive the eye
the flaming rubies show their sanguine dye
bright azure rays from lively sapphires stream
and lucid amber casts a golden gleam
with variouscolourd light the pavement shone
and all on fire appeard the glowing throne
the domes high arch reflects the mingled blaze
and forms a rainbow of alternate rays
when on the goddess first i cast my sight
scarce seemd her stature of a cubits height


but swelld to larger size the more i gazed
till to the roof her towering front she raised
with her the temple every moment grew
and ampler vistas opend to my view
upward the columns shoot the roofs ascend
and arches widen and long aisles extend
such was her form as ancient bards have told
wings raise her arms and wings her feet infold
a thousand busy tongues the goddess bears
a thousand open eyes and thousand listening ears


beneath in order ranged the tuneful nine
her virgin handmaids still attend the shrine
with eyes on fame for ever fixd they sing
for fame they raise the voice and tune the string
with times first birth began the heavenly lays
and last eternal through the length of days


around these wonders as i cast a look
the trumpet sounded and the temple shook
and all the nations summond at the call
from different quarters fill the crowded hall
of various tongues the mingled sounds were heard
in various garbs promiscuous throngs appeard
thick as the bees that with the spring renew
their flowery toils and sip the fragrant dew
when the wingd colonies first tempt the sky
oer dusky fields and shaded waters fly
or settling seize the sweets the blossoms yield
and a low murmur runs along the field
millions of suppliant crowds the shrine attend
and all degrees before the goddess bend


the poor the rich the valiant and the sage
and boasting youth and narrative old age
their pleas were different their request the same
for good and bad alike are fond of fame
some she disgraced and some with honours crownd
unlike successes equal merits found
thus her blind sister fickle fortune reigns
and undiscerning scatters crowns and chains


first at the shrine the learned world appear
and to the goddess thus prefer their prayer
long have we sought to instruct and please mankind
with studies pale with midnight vigils blind
but thankd by few rewarded yet by none
we here appeal to thy superior throne
on wit and learning the just prize bestow
for fame is all we must expect below


the goddess heard and bade the muses raise
the golden trumpet of eternal praise
from pole to pole the winds diffuse the sound
that fills the circuit of the world around
not all at once as thunder breaks the cloud
the notes at first were rather sweet than loud
by just degrees they every moment rise
fill the wide earth and gain upon the skies
at every breath were balmy odours shed
which still grew sweeter as they wider spread
less fragrant scents the unfolding rose exhales
or spices breathing in arabian gales


next these the good and just an awful train
thus on their knees address the sacred fane
since living virtue is with envy cursed
and the best men are treated like the worst
do thou just goddess call our merits forth
and give each deed the exact intrinsic worth


not with bare justice shall your act be crownd
said fame but high above desert renownd
let fuller notes the applauding world amaze
and the loud clarion labour in your praise


this band dismissd behold another crowd
preferrd the same request and lowly bowd
the constant tenor of whose wellspent days
no less deserved a just return of praise
but straight the direful trump of slander sounds
through the big dome the doubling thunder bounds
loud as the burst of cannon rends the skies
the dire report through every region flies


in every ear incessant rumours rung
and gathering scandals grew on every tongue
from the black trumpets rusty concave broke
sulphureous flames and clouds of rolling smoke
the poisonous vapour blots the purple skies
and withers all before it as it flies


a troop came next who crowns and armour wore
and proud defiance in their looks they bore
for thee they cried amidst alarms and strife
we saild in tempests down the stream of life
for thee whole nations filld with flames and blood
and swam to empire through the purple flood
those ills we dared thy inspiration own
what virtue seemd was done for thee alone


ambitious fools the queen replied and frownd
be all your acts in dark oblivion drownd
there sleep forgot with mighty tyrants gone
your statues moulderd and your names unknown
a sudden cloud straight snatchd them from my sight
and each majestic phantom sunk in night


then came the smallest tribe i yet had seen
plain was their dress and modest was their mien
great idol of mankind we neither claim
the praise of merit nor aspire to fame
but safe in deserts from the applause of men
would die unheard of as we lived unseen
tis all we beg thee to conceal from sight
those acts of goodness which themselves requite
oh let us still the secret joy partake
to follow virtue even for virtues sake


and live there men who slight immortal fame
who then with incense shall adore our name
but mortals know tis still our greatest pride
to blaze those virtues which the good would hide
rise muses rise add all your tuneful breath
these must not sleep in darkness and in death
she said in air the trembling music floats
and on the winds triumphant swell the notes
so soft though high so loud and yet so clear
even listening angels leand from heaven to hear
to furthest shores the ambrosial spirit flies
sweet to the world and grateful to the skies


next these a youthful train their vows expressd
with feathers crownd with gay embroidery dressd
hither they cried direct your eyes and see
the men of pleasure dress and gallantry
ours is the place at banquets balls and plays
sprightly our nights polite are all our days
courts we frequent where tis our pleasing care
to pay due visits and address the fair
in fact tis true no nymph we could persuade
but still in fancy vanquishd every maid
of unknown duchesses lewd tales we tell
yet would the world believe us all were well
the joy let others have and we the name
and what we want in pleasure grant in fame


the queen assents the trumpet rends the skies
and at each blast a ladys honour dies


pleased with the strange success vast numbers pressd
around the shrine and made the same request
what you she cried unlearnd in arts to please
slaves to yourselves and even fatigued with ease
who lose a length of undeserving days
would you usurp the lovers dearbought praise
to just contempt ye vain pretenders fall
the peoples fable and the scorn of all
straight the black clarion sends a horrid sound
loud laughs burst out and bitter scoffs fly round
whispers are heard with taunts reviling loud
and scornful hisses run through all the crowd


last those who boast of mighty mischiefs done
enslave their country or usurp a throne
or who their glorys dire foundation laid
on sovereigns ruind or on friends betrayd
calm thinking villains whom no faith could fix
of crooked counsels and dark politics
of these a gloomy tribe surround the throne
and beg to make the immortal treasons known
the trumpet roars long flaky flames expire
with sparks that seemd to set the world on fire
at the dread sound pale mortals stood aghast
and startled nature trembled with the blast


this having heard and seen some power unknown
straight changed the scene and snatchd me from the throne
before my view appeard a structure fair
its site uncertain if in earth or air
with rapid motion turnd the mansion round
with ceaseless noise the ringing walls resound
not less in number were the spacious doors
than leaves on trees or sands upon the shores
which still unfolded stand by night by day
pervious to winds and open every way
as flames by nature to the skies ascend
as weighty bodies to the centre tend
as to the sea returning rivers roll
and the touchd needle trembles to the pole
hither as to their proper place arise
all various sounds from earth and seas and skies


or spoke aloud or whisperd in the ear
nor ever silence rest or peace is here
as on the smooth expanse of crystal lakes
the sinking stone at first a circle makes
the trembling surface by the motion stirrd
spreads in a second circle then a third
wide and more wide the floating rings advance
fill all the watery plain and to the margin dance
thus every voice and sound when first they break
on neighbouring air a soft impression make
another ambient circle then they move
that in its turn impels the next above
through undulating air the sounds are sent
and spread oer all the fluid element


there various news i heard of love and strife
of peace and war health sickness death and life
of loss and gain of famine and of store
of storms at sea and travels on the shore
of prodigies and portents seen in air
of fires and plagues and stars with blazing hair
of turns of fortune changes in the state
the falls of favourites projects of the great
of old mismanagements taxations new
all neither wholly false nor wholly true


above below without within around
confused unnumberd multitudes are found
who pass repass advance and glide away
hosts raised by fear and phantoms of a day
astrologers that future fates foreshow
projectors quacks and lawyers not a few
and priests and partyzealots numerous bands
with homeborn lies or tales from foreign lands
each talkd aloud or in some secret place
and wild impatience stared in every face
the flying rumours gatherd as they rolld
scarce any tale was sooner heard than told


and all who told it added something new
and all who heard it made enlargements too
in every ear it spread on every tongue it grew


thus flying east and west and north and south
news travelld with increase from mouth to mouth


so from a spark that kindled first by chance
with gathering force the quickening flames advance
till to the clouds their curling heads aspire
and towers and temples sink in floods of fire
when thus ripe lies are to perfection sprung
full grown and fit to grace a mortal tongue
through thousand vents impatient forth they flow
and rush in millions on the world below
fame sits aloft and points them out their course
their date determines and prescribes their force
some to remain and some to perish soon
or wane and wax alternate like the moon
around a thousand winged wonders fly
born by the trumpets blast and scatterd through the sky


there at one passage oft you might survey
a lie and truth contending for the way
and long twas doubtful both so closely pent
which first should issue through the narrow vent
at last agreed together out they fly
inseparable now the truth and lie
the strict companions are for ever joind
and this or that unmixd no mortal eer shall find


while thus i stood intent to see and hear
one came methought and whisperd in my ear
what could thus high thy rash ambition raise
art thou fond youth a candidate for praise


tis true said i not void of hopes i came
for who so fond as youthful bards of fame
but few alas the casual blessing boast
so hard to gain so easy to be lost
how vain that second life in others breath
the estate which wits inherit after death
ease health and life for this they must resign
unsure the tenure but how vast the fine
the great mans curse without the gains endure
be envied wretched and be flatterd poor
all luckless wits their enemies professd
and all successful jealous friends at best
nor fame i slight nor for her favours call
she comes unlookd for if she comes at all
but if the purchase costs so dear a price
as soothing folly or exalting vice
oh if the muse must flatter lawless sway
and follow still where fortune leads the way
or if no basis bear my rising name
but the fallen ruins of anothers fame
then teach me heaven to scorn the guilty bays
drive from my breast that wretched lust of praise
unblemishd let me live or die unknown
oh grant an honest fame or grant me none


in these deep solitudes and awful cells
where heavenlypensive contemplation dwells
and evermusing melancholy reigns
what means this tumult in a vestals veins
why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat
why feels my heart its longforgotten heat
yet yet i lovefrom abelard it came
and eloisa yet must kiss the name


dear fatal name rest ever unreveald
nor pass these lips in holy silence seald
hide it my heart within that close disguise
where mixd with gods his loved idea lies
oh write it not my handthe name appears
already writtenwash it out my tears
in vain lost eloisa weeps and prays
her heart still dictates and her hand obeys


relentless walls whose darksome round contains
repentant sighs and voluntary pains
ye rugged rocks which holy knees have worn
ye grots and caverns shaggd with horrid thorn
shrines where their vigils paleeyed virgins keep
and pitying saints whose statues learn to weep
though cold like you unmoved and silent grown
i have not yet forgot myself to stone
all is not heavens while abelard has part
still rebel nature holds out half my heart
nor prayers nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain
nor tears for ages taught to flow in vain


soon as thy letters trembling i unclose
that wellknown name awakens all my woes
oh name for ever sad for ever dear
still breathed in sighs still usherd with a tear
i tremble too whereer my own i find
some dire misfortune follows close behind
line after line my gushing eyes oerflow
led through a sad variety of woe
now warm in love now withering in my bloom
lost in a convents solitary gloom
there stern religion quenchd the unwilling flame
there died the best of passions love and fame


yet write oh write me all that i may join
griefs to thy griefs and echo sighs to thine
nor foes nor fortune take this power away
and is my abelard less kind than they
tears still are mine and those i need not spare
love but demands what else were shed in prayer
no happier task these faded eyes pursue
to read and weep is all they now can do


then share thy pain allow that sad relief
ah more than share it give me all thy grief
heaven first taught letters for some wretchs aid
some banishd lover or some captive maid
they live they speak they breathe what love inspires
warm from the soul and faithful to its fires
the virgins wish without her fears impart
excuse the blush and pour out all the heart
speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul
and waft a sigh from indus to the pole


thou knowst how guiltless first i met thy flame
when love approachd me under friendships name
my fancy formd thee of angelic kind
some emanation of the allbeauteous mind
those smiling eyes attempering every ray
shone sweetly lambent with celestial day
guiltless i gazed heaven listend while you sung
and truths divine came mended from that tongue
from lips like those what precept faild to move
too soon they taught me twas no sin to love
back through the paths of pleasing sense i ran
nor wishd an angel whom i loved a man
dim and remote the joys of saints i see
nor envy them that heaven i lose for thee


how oft when pressd to marriage have i said
curse on all laws but those which love has made
love free as air at sight of human ties
spreads his light wings and in a moment flies
let wealth let honour wait the wedded dame
august her deed and sacred be her fame
before true passion all those views remove
fame wealth and honour what are you to love
the jealous god when we profane his fires
those restless passions in revenge inspires
and bids them make mistaken mortals groan
who seek in love for aught but love alone
should at my feet the worlds great master fall
himself his throne his world id scorn them all
not caesars empress would i deign to prove
no make me mistress to the man i love
if there be yet another name more free
more fond than mistress make me that to thee
oh happy state when souls each other draw
when love is liberty and nature law
all then is full possessing and possessd
no craving void left aching in the breast
even thought meets thought ere from the lips it part
and each warm wish springs mutual from the heart
this sure is bliss if bliss on earth there be
and once the lot of abelard and me


alas how changed what sudden horrors rise
a naked lover bound and bleeding lies
where where was eloise her voice her hand
her poniard had opposed the dire command
barbarian stay that bloody stroke restrain
the crime was common common be the pain
i can no more by shame by rage suppressd
let tears and burning blushes speak the rest


canst thou forget that sad that solemn day
when victims at yon altars foot we lay
canst thou forget what tears that moment fell
when warm in youth i bade the world farewell
as with cold lips i kissd the sacred veil
the shrines all trembled and the lamps grew pale
heaven scarce believed the conquest it surveyd
and saints with wonder heard the vows i made
yet then to those dread altars as i drew
not on the cross my eyes were fixd but you
not grace or zeal love only was my call
and if i lose thy love i lose my all
come with thy looks thy words relieve my woe
those still at least are left thee to bestow
still on that breast enamourd let me lie
still drink delicious poison from thy eye
pant on thy lip and to thy heart be pressd
give all thou canstand let me dream the rest
ah no instruct me other joys to prize
with other beauties charm my partial eyes
full in my view set all the bright abode
and make my soul quit abelard for god


ah think at least thy flock deserves thy care
plants of thy hand and children of thy prayer
from the false world in early youth they fled
by thee to mountains wilds and deserts led
you raised these hallowd walls the desert smiled
and paradise was opend in the wild
no weeping orphan saw his fathers stores
our shrines irradiate or emblaze the floors
no silver saints by dying misers given
here bribed the rage of illrequited heaven
but such plain roofs as piety could raise
and only vocal with the makers praise
in these lone walls their days eternal bound
these mossgrown domes with spiry turrets crownd
where awful arches make a noonday night
and the dim windows shed a solemn light
thy eyes diffused a reconciling ray
and gleams of glory brightend all the day
but now no face divine contentment wears
tis all blank sadness or continual tears
see how the force of others prayers i try
oh pious fraud of amorous charity
but why should i on others prayers depend
come thou my father brother husband friend
ah let thy handmaid sister daughter move
and all those tender names in onethy love
the darksome pines that oer yon rocks reclined
wave high and murmur to the hollow wind
the wandering streams that shine between the hills
the grots that echo to the tinkling rills
the dying gales that pant upon the trees
the lakes that quiver to the curling breeze
no more these scenes my meditation aid
or lull to rest the visionary maid
but oer the twilight groves and dusky caves
longsounding aisles and intermingled graves
black melancholy sits and round her throws
a deathlike silence and a dread repose
her gloomy presence saddens all the scene
shades every flower and darkens every green
deepens the murmur of the falling floods
and breathes a browner horror on the woods


yet here for ever ever must i stay
sad proof how well a lover can obey
death only death can break the lasting chain
and here even then shall my cold dust remain
here all its frailties all its flames resign
and wait till tis no sin to mix with thine


ah wretch believed the spouse of god in vain
confessd within the slave of love and man
assist me heaven but whence arose that prayer
sprung it from piety or from despair
even here where frozen chastity retires
love finds an altar for forbidden fires
i ought to grieve but cannot what i ought
i mourn the lover not lament the fault
i view my crime but kindle at the view
repent old pleasures and solicit new
now turnd to heaven i weep my past offence
now think of thee and curse my innocence
of all affliction taught a lover yet
tis sure the hardest science to forget
how shall i lose the sin yet keep the sense
and love the offender yet detest the offence
how the dear object from the crime remove
or how distinguish penitence from love
unequal task a passion to resign
for hearts so touchd so pierced so lost as mine
ere such a soul regains its peaceful state
how often must it love how often hate
how often hope despair resent regret
conceal disdaindo all things but forget
but let heaven seize it all at once tis fired
not touchd but rapt not wakend but inspired
oh come oh teach me nature to subdue
renounce my love my life myselfand you
fill my fond heart with god alone for he
alone can rival can succeed to thee


how happy is the blameless vestals lot
the world forgetting by the world forgot
eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
each prayer accepted and each wish resignd
labour and rest that equal periods keep
obedient slumbers that can wake and weep
desires composed affections ever even
tears that delight and sighs that waft to heaven
grace shines around her with serenest beams
and whispering angels prompt her golden dreams
for her the unfading rose of eden blooms
and wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes
for her the spouse prepares the bridal ring
for her white virgins hymeneals sing
to sounds of heavenly harps she dies away
and melts in visions of eternal day


far other dreams my erring soul employ
far other raptures of unholy joy
when at the close of each sad sorrowing day
fancy restores what vengeance snatchd away
then conscience sleeps and leaving nature free
all my loose soul unbounded springs to thee
o curst dear horrors of allconscious night
how glowing guilt exalts the keen delight
provoking demons all restraint remove
and stir within me every source of love
i hear thee view thee gaze oer all thy charms
and round thy phantom glue my clasping arms
i wakeno more i hear no more i view
the phantom flies me as unkind as you
i call aloud it hears not what i say
i stretch my empty arms it glides away
to dream once more i close my willing eyes
ye soft illusions dear deceits arise
alas no more methinks we wandering go
through dreary wastes and weep each others woe
where round some mouldering tower pale ivy creeps
and lowbrowd rocks hang nodding oer the deeps
sudden you mount you beckon from the skies
clouds interpose waves roar and winds arise
i shriek start up the same sad prospect find
and wake to all the griefs i left behind


for thee the fates severely kind ordain
a cool suspense from pleasure and from pain
thy life a long dead calm of fixd repose
no pulse that riots and no blood that glows
still as the sea ere winds were taught to blow
or moving spirit bade the waters flow
soft as the slumbers of a saint forgiven
and mild as opening gleams of promised heaven


come abelard for what hast thou to dread
the torch of venus burns not for the dead
nature stands checkd religion disapproves
even thou art coldyet eloisa loves
ah hopeless lasting flames like those that burn
to light the dead and warm the unfruitful urn


what scenes appear whereer i turn my view
the dear ideas where i fly pursue
rise in the grove before the altar rise
stain all my soul and wanton in my eyes
i waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee
thy image steals between my god and me
thy voice i seem in every hymn to hear
with every bead i drop too soft a tear
when from the censer clouds of fragrance roll
and swelling organs lift the rising soul
one thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight
priests tapers temples swim before my sight
in seas of flame my plunging soul is drownd
while altars blaze and angels tremble round


while prostrate here in humble grief i lie
kind virtuous drops just gathering in my eye
while praying trembling in the dust i roll
and dawning grace is opening on my soul
come if thou darst all charming as thou art
oppose thyself to heaven dispute my heart
come with one glance of those deluding eyes
blot out each bright idea of the skies
take back that grace those sorrows and those tears
take back my fruitless penitence and prayers
snatch me just mounting from the blest abode
assist the fiends and tear me from my god


no fly me fly me far as pole from pole
rise alps between us and whole oceans roll
ah come not write not think not once of me
nor share one pang of all i felt for thee
thy oaths i quit thy memory resign
forget renounce me hate whateer was mine
fair eyes and tempting looks which yet i view
long loved adored ideas all adieu
o grace serene o virtue heavenly fair
divine oblivion of lowthoughted care
fresh blooming hope gay daughter of the sky
and faith our early immortality
enter each mild each amicable guest
receive and wrap me in eternal rest


see in her cell sad eloisa spread
proppd on some tomb a neighbour of the dead
in each low wind methinks a spirit calls
and more than echoes talk along the walls
here as i watchd the dying lamps around
from yonder shrine i heard a hollow sound
come sister come it said or seemd to say
thy place is here sad sister come away
once like thyself i trembled wept and prayd
loves victim then though now a sainted maid
but all is calm in this eternal sleep
here grief forgets to groan and love to weep
even superstition loses every fear
for god not man absolves our frailties here


i come i come prepare your roseate bowers
celestial palms and everblooming flowers
thither where sinners may have rest i go
where flames refined in breasts seraphic glow
thou abelard the last sad office pay
and smooth my passage to the realms of day
see my lips tremble and my eyeballs roll
suck my last breath and catch my flying soul
ah noin sacred vestments mayst thou stand
the hallowd taper trembling in thy hand
present the cross before my lifted eye
teach me at once and learn of me to die
ah then thy onceloved eloisa see
it will be then no crime to gaze on me
see from my cheek the transient roses fly
see the last sparkle languish in my eye
till every motion pulse and breath be oer
and even my abelard be loved no more
o death alleloquent you only prove
what dust we doat on when tis man we love


then too when fate shall thy fair frame destroy
that cause of all my guilt and all my joy
in trance ecstatic may thy pangs be drownd
bright clouds descend and angels watch thee round
from opening skies may streaming glories shine
and saints embrace thee with a love like mine


may one kind grave unite each hapless name
and graft my love immortal on thy fame
then ages hence when all my woes are oer
when this rebellious heart shall beat no more
if ever chance two wandering lovers brings
to paracletes white walls and silver springs
oer the pale marble shall they join their heads
and drink the falling tears each other sheds
then sadly saywith mutual pity moved
oh may we never love as these have loved
from the full choir when loud hosannas rise
and swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice
amid that scene if some relenting eye
glance on the stone where our cold relics lie
devotions self shall steal a thought from heaven
one human tear shall drop and be forgiven
and sure if fate some future bard shall join
in sad similitude of griefs to mine
condemnd whole years in absence to deplore
and image charms he must behold no more
such if there be who love so long so well
let him our sad our tender story tell
the wellsung woes will soothe my pensive ghost
he best can paint them who shall feel them most


such were the notes thy onceloved poet sung
till death untimely stoppd his tuneful tongue
oh just beheld and lost admired and mournd
with softest manners gentlest arts adornd
blest in each science blest in every strain
dear to the muse to harley dearin vain


for him thou oft hast bid the world attend
fond to forget the statesman in the friend
for swift and him despised the farce of state
the sober follies of the wise and great
dextrous the craving fawning crowd to quit
and pleased to scape from flattery to wit


absent or dead still let a friend be dear
a sigh the absent claims the dead a tear
recall those nights that closed thy toilsome days
still hear thy parnell in his living lays
who careless now of interest fame or fate
perhaps forgets that oxford eer was great
or deeming meanest what we greatest call
behold thee glorious only in thy fall


and sure if aught below the seats divine
can touch immortals tis a soul like thine
a soul supreme in each hard instance tried
above all pain all passion and all pride
the rage of power the blast of public breath
the lust of lucre and the dread of death


in vain to deserts thy retreat is made
the muse attends thee to thy silent shade
tis hers the brave mans latest steps to trace
rejudge his acts and dignify disgrace
when interest calls off all her sneaking train
and all the obliged desert and all the vain
she waits or to the scaffold or the cell
when the last lingering friend has bid farewell
even now she shades thy eveningwalk with bays
no hireling she no prostitute to praise
even now observant of the parting ray
eyes the calm sunset of thy various day
through fortunes cloud one truly great can see
nor fears to tell that mortimer is he


with ekes and alsos tack thy strain
great bard and sing the deathless prince
who lost namur the same campaign
he bought dixmuyd and puinderd deynse


ill hold ten pound my dream is out
id tell it you but for the rattle
of those confounded drums no doubt
yon bloody rogues intend a battle
dear me a hundred thousand french
with terror fill the neighbring field
while william carries on the trench
till both the town and castle yield
villeroy to boufflers should advance
says mars through cannons mouths in fire
id est one mareschal of france
tells tother he can come no nigher
regain the lines the shortest way
villeroy or to versailles take post
for having seen it thou canst say
the steps by which namur was lost


the smoke and fiame may vex thy sight
look not once back but as thou goest
quicken the squadrons in their flight
and bid the d â a take the slowest
think not what reason to produce
from louis to conceal thy fear
he a a own the strength of thy excuse
tell him that william was but there


now let us look for louis feather
that usd to shine so like a star
the genrals could not get together
wanting that influence great in war
o poet thou hadst been discreeter
hanging the monarchs hat so high
if thou hadst dubbd thy star a meteor
that did but blaze and rove and die


to animate the doubtful fight
namur in vain expects that ray
in vain france hopes the sickly light
should shine near williams fuller day
it knows versailles its proper station
nor cares for any foreign sphere
where you see boileaus constellation
be sure no danger can be near


the french had gatherd all their force
and william met them in their way
yet oâf they brushd both foot and horse
what has friend boileau left to say


when his high muse is bent upont
to sing her king â that great commander
or on the shores of hellespont
or in the valleys near scamander


would it not spoil his noble task
if any foolish phrygian there is
impertinent enough to ask
how far namur may be from paris


two stanzas more before we end
of death pikes rocks arms bricks and fire
leave them behind you honest friend
and with your countrymen retire


your ode is spoilt namur is freed
for dixmuyd something yet is due
â good count guiscard may proceed
but boufflers sir one word with you


tis done in sight of these commanders
who neither fight nor raise the siege
the foes of france march safe through flanders
divide to bruxelles or to liege


send fame this news to trianon
that boufflers may new honours gain
he the same play by land has shown
as tourlle did upon the main


yet is the marshal made a peer
o william may thy arms advance
that he may lose dinant next year
and so be constable of france


ye careful angels whom eternal fate
ordains on earth and human acts to wait
who turn with secret power this restless ball
and bid predestind empires rise and fall
your sacred aid religious monarchs own
when first they merit then ascend the throne
but tyrants dread ye lest your just decree
transfer the power and set the people free
see rescud britain at your altars bow
and hear her hymns your happy care avow
that still her axes and her rods support
the judges frown and grace the awful court
that law with all her pompous terror stands
to wrest the dagger from the traitors hands
and rigid justice reads the fatal word
poises the balance first then draws the sword


britain her safety to your guidance owns
that she can seprate parricides from sons
that impious rage disarmd she lives and reigns
her freedom kept by him who broke her chains


and thou great minister above the rest
of guardian spirits be thou for ever blest
thou who of old wert sent to israels court
with secret aid great davids strong support
to mock the frantic rage of cruel saul
and strike the useless javelin to the wall
thy later care oer williams temples held
on boynes propitious banks the heavnly shield
when power divine did sovereign right declare
and cannons markdwhom they were bid to spare


still blessed angel be thy care the same
be williams life untouchd as is his fame
let him own thine as britain owns his hand
save thou the king as he has savd the land


we angels forms in pious monarchs view
we reverence william for he acts like you
like you commissiond to chastise and bless
he must avenge the world and give it peace


indulgent fate our potent prayer receives
and still britannia smiles and william lives
the hero dear to earth by heavn belovd
by troubles must be vexd by dangers provd
his foes must aid to make his fame complete
and fix his throne secure on their defeat


so though with sudden rage the tempest comes
though the winds roar and though the water foams


imperial britain on the sea looks down
and smiling sees her rebel subject frown
striking her cliff the storm confirms her powr
the waves but whiten her triumphant shore
in vain they would advance in vain retreat
broken they dash and perish at her feet


for william still new wonders shall be shown
the powers that rescued shall preserve the throne
safe on his darling britains joyful sea
behold the monarch ploughs his liquid way
his fleets in thunder through the world declare
whose empire they obey whose arms they bear
blessd by aspiring winds he finds the strand
blackend with clouds he sees the nations stand
blessing his safety proud of his command
in vsirious tongues he hears the captains dwell
on their great leaders praise by turns they tell
and listen each with emulous glory fird
how william conquerd and how france retird
how belgia freed the heros arm confessd
but trembled for the courage which she blessd


o louis from this great example know
to be at once a hero and a foe
by sounding trumpets hear and rattling drums
when william to the open vengeance comes
and see the soldier plead the monarchs right
heading his troops and foremost in the fight


hence then close ambush and perfidious war
down to your native seats of night repair
and thou bellona weep thy cruel pride
restraiiid behind the victors chariot tied
in brazen knots and everlasting chains
so europes peace so williams fate ordains
while on the ivory chair in happy state
he sits secure in innocence and great
in regal clemency and views beneath
averted darts of rage and pointless arms of death


see whilst thou weepst fair cloe see
the world in sympathy with thee
the cheerful birds no longer sing
each droops his head and hangs his wing
the clouds have bent their bosom lower
and shed their sorrows in a shower
the brooks beyond their limits flow
and louder murmurs speak their woe
the nymphs and swains adopt thy cares
they heave thy sighs and weep thy tears
fantastic nymph that grief should move
thy heart obdurate against love
strange tears whose power can soften all
but that dear breast on which they fall


dear howard from the soft assaults of love
poets and painters never are secure
can i untouchd the fair ones passions move
or thou draw beauty and not feel its power


to great apelles when young aramon brought
the darling idol of his captive heart
and the pleasd nymph with kind attention sat
to have her charms recorded by his art


the amrous master ownd her potent eyes
sighd when he lookd and trembled as he drew
each flowing line confirmd his first surprise
and as the piece advancd the passion grew


while philips son while venus son was near
what different tortures does his bosom feel
great was the rival and the god severe
nor could he hide his flame nor durst reveal


the prince renownd in bounty as in arms
with pity saw the illconceald distress
quitted his title to campaspes charms
and gave the fair one to the friends embrace


thus the more beauteous cloe sat to thee
good howard emulous of the grecian art
but happy thou from cupids arrow free
and flames that piercd thy predecessors heart


had thy poor breast receivd an equal pain
had i been vested with the monarchs power
thou must have sighd unlucky youth in vain
nor from my bounty hadst thou found a cure


though to convince thee that the friend did feel
a kind concern for thy illfated care
i would have soothd the flame i could not heal
givn thee the world though i withheld the fair


beneath a myrtles verdant shade
as cloe half asleep was laid
cupid perchd lightly on her breast
and in that heavn desird to rest
over her paps his wings he spread
between he found a downy bed
and nestled in his little head


still lay the god the nymph surprisd
yet mistress of herself devisd
how she the vagrant might enthral
and captive him who captives all


her bodice halfway she unlacd
about his arms she shiy cast
the silken bond and held him fast


the god awakd and thrice in vain
he strove to break the cruel chain
and thrice in vain he shook his wing
incumberd in the silken string


fluttring the god and weeping said
pity poor cupid generous maid
who happend being blind to stray
and on thy bosom lost his way
who strayd alas but knew too well
he never there must hope to dwell
set an unhappy prisner free
who neer intended harm to thee


to me pertains not she replies
to know or care where cupid flies
what are his haunts or which his way
where he would dwell or whither stray
yet will i never set thee free
for harm was meant and harm to me


vain fears that vex thy virgin heart
ill give thee up my bow and dart
untangle but this cruel chain
and freely let me fly again


agreed secure my virgin heart
instant give up thy bow and dart
the chain ill in return untie
and freely thou again shalt fly


thus she the captive did deliver
the captive thus gave up his quiver
the god disarmd eer since that day
passes his life in harmless play
flies round or sits upon her breast
a little fluttering idle guest


eer since that day the beauteous maid
governs the world in cupids stead
directs his arrow as she wills
gives grief or pleasure spares or kills


behind her neck her comely tresses tied
her ivory quiver graceful by her side
ahunting cloe went she lost her way
and through the woods uncertain chancd to stray
apollo passing by beheld the maid
and sister dear bright cynthia turn he said
the hunted hind lies close in yonder brake
loud cupid laughd to see the gods mistake
and laughing cried learn better great divine
to know thy kindred and to honour mine
rightly advisd far hence thy sister seek
or on meanders bank or latmus peak
but in this nymph my friend my sister know
she draws my arrows and she bends my bow
fair thames she haunts and every neighbring grove
sacred to soft recess and gentle love
go with thy cynthia hurl the pointed spear
at the rough boar or chase the flying deer
i and my cloe take a nobler aim
at human hearts we fling nor ever miss the game


in heaven one holiday you read
in wise anacreon ganymede
drew heedless cupid in to throw
a main to pass an hour or so
the little trojan by the way
by hermes taught playd all the play


the god unhappily engagd
by nature rash by play enragd
complaind and sighd and cried and fretted
lost every earthly thing he betted
in readymoney all the store
pickd up long since from danaes shower
a snuffbox set with bleeding hearts
rubies all piercd with diamond darts
his ninepins made of myrtle wood
the tree in idas forest stood
his bowl pure gold the very same
which paris gave the cyprian dame
two tablebooks in shagreen covers
filld with good verse from real lovers


merchandise rare a billetdoux
its matter passionate yet true
heaps of hair rings and cipherd seals
rich trifles serious bagatelles


what sad disorders play begets
desperate and mad at length he sets
those darts whose points make gods adore
his might and deprecate his power
those darts whence all our joy and pain
arise those darts â come sevens the main
cries ganymede the usual trick
seven slur a six eleven a nick


ill news goes fast twas quickly known
that simple cupid was undone
swifter than lightning venus flew
too late she found the thing too true
guess how the goddess greets her son
come hither sirrah no begone


and hark ye is it so indeed
a comrade you for ganymede
an imp as wicked for his age
as any earthly ladys page
a scandal and a scourge to troy
a princes son a black guard boy
a sharper that with box and dice
draws in young deities to vice
all heaven is by the ears together
since first that little rogue came hither
juno herself has had no peace
and truly ive been favourd less


for jove as fame reports but fame
says things not fit for me to name
has acted ill for such a god
and taken ways extremely odd


and thou unhappy child she said
her anger by her grief allayd
unhappy child who thus hast lost
all the estate we eer could boast
whither o whither wilt thou run
thy name despisd thy weakness known
nor shall thy shrine on earth be crownd
nor shall thy power in heaven be ownd
when thou nor man nor god canst wound


obedient cupid kneeling cried
cease dearest mother cease to chide
ganys a cheat and im a bubble
yet why this great excess of trouble
the dice were false the darts are gone
yet how are you or i undone


the loss of these i can supply
with keener shafts from cloes eye
fear not we eer can be disgracd
while that bright magazine shall last
your crowded altars still shall smoke
and man your friendly aid invoke
jove shall again revere your power
and rise a swan or fall a shower


as after noon one summers day
venus stood bathing in a river
cupid ashooting went that way
new stnmg his bow new filld his quiver


with skill he chose his sharpest dart
with all his might his bow he drew
swift to his beauteous parents heart
the too wellguided arrow flew


i faint i die the goddess cried
cruel couldst thou find none other
to wreck thy spleen on parricide
like nero thou hast slain thy mother


poor cupid sobbing scarce could speak
indeed mamma i did not know ye
alas how easy my mistake
i took you for your likeness cloe


when cloes picture was to venus shown
i surprisd the goddess took it for her own
and what said she does this bold painter mean
when was i bathing thus and naked seen


pleasd cupid heard and checkd his mothers pride
and whos blind now mamma the urchin cried
tis cloes eye and cheek and lip and breast
friend howards genius fancied all the rest


if wine and music have the power
to ease the sickness of the soul
let phoebus ever string explore
and bacchus fill the sprightly bowl
let them their friendly aid employ
to make my cloes absence light
and seek for pleasure to destroy
the sorrows of this livelong night


but she tomorrow will return
venus be thou tomorrow great
thy myrtles strow thy odours burn
and meet thy favrite nymph in state
kind goddess to no other powers
let us tomorrows blessings own
thy darling loves shall gniide the hours
and all the day be thine alone


in virgils sacred verse we find
that passion can depress or raise
the heavenly as the human mind
who dare deny what virgil says


but if they should what our great master
has thus laid down my tale shall prove
fair venus wept the sad disaster
of having lost her favourite dove


in complaisance poor cupid mournd
his grief relievd his mothers pain
he vowd hed leave no stone unturnd
but she should have her dove again


though none said he shall yet be namd
i know the felon well enough
but be she not mamma condemnd
without a fair and legal proof


with that his longest dart he took
as constable would take his staff
that gods desire like men to look
would make een heraclitus laugh


loves subalterns a duteous band
like watchmen round their chief appear
each had his lantern in his hand
and venus maskd brought up the rear


accoutred thus their eager step
to cloes lodging they directed
at once i write alas and weep
that cloe is of theft suspected


late they set out had far to go
st dunstans as they passd struck one
cloe for reasons good you know
lives at the sober end o th town


with one great peal they rap the door
like footmen on a visiting day
folks at her house at such an hour
lord what will all the neighbours say


the door is open up they run
nor prayers nor threats divert their speed
thieves thieves cries susan avere undone
theyll kill my mistress in her bed


in bed indeed the nymph had been
three hours for all historians say
she commonly went up at ten
unless piquet was in the way


she wakd he sure with strangle surprise
o cupid is this right or law
thus to disturb the brightest eyes
that ever slept or ever saw


have you observd a sitting hare
listening and fearful of the storm
of horns and hounds clap back her ear
afraid to keep or leave her form


or have you markd a partridge quake
viewing the towering falcon nigh
she cuddles low behind the brake
nor would she stay nor dares she fly


then have you seen the beauteous maid
when gazing on her midnight foes
she turnd each way her frighted head
then sunk it deep beneath the clothes


venus this while was in the chamber
incognito for susan said
it smelt so strong of myrrh and amber
and susan is no lying maid


but since we have no present need
of venus for an episode
with cupid let us een proceed
and thus to cloe spoke the god


hold up your head hold up your hand
would it were not my lot to show ye
this cruel writ wherein you stand
indicted by the name of cloe


for that by secret malice stirrd
or by an emulous pride invited
you have purloind the faviite bird
in which my mother most delighted


her blushing face the lovely maid
raisd just above the milkwhite sheet
a rosetree in a lily bed
nor glows so red nor breathes so sweet


are you not he whom virgins fear
and widows court is not your name
cupid if so pray come not near
fair maiden im the very same


then what have i good sir to say
or do with hsr you call your mother
if i should meet her in my way
we hardly courtesy to each other


diana chaste and hebe sweet
witness that what i speak is true
i would not give my paroquet
for all the doves that ever flew


yet to compose this midnight noise
go freely search where er you please
the rage that raisd adornd her voice
upon yon toilet lie my keys


her keys he takes her doors unlocks
through wardrobe and through closet bounces
peeps into eveiy chest and box
turns all her furbelows and flounces


but dove depend ont finds he none
so to the bed returns again
and now the maiden bolder grown
begins to treat him with disdain


i marvel much she smiling said
your poultry cannot yet be found
lies he in yonder slipper dead
or may be in the teapot drownd


no traitor angry love replies
hes hid somewhere about your breast
a place nor god nor man denies
for venus dove the proper nest


search then she said put in your hand
and cynthia dear protectress guard me
as guilty i or free may stand
do thou or punish or reward me


but ah what maid to love can trust
he scorns and breaks all legal power
into her breast his hand he thrust
and in a moment forcd it lower


u whither do those fingers rove
cries cloe treacherous urchin whither
o venus i shall find thy dove
savs he for sure i touch his feather


as cloe came into the room tother day
i peevish began where so long could you stay
in your lifetime you never regarded your hour
you promisd at two and pray look child tis four
a ladys watch needs neither figures nor wheels
tis enough that tis loaded with bawbles and seals
a temper so heedless no mortal can bear
thus far i went on with a resolute air
lord bless me said she let a body but speak
heros an ugly hard rosebud fallen into my neck


it has hurt me and vexd me to such a degree
see here for you never believe me pray see
on the left side my breast what a mark it has made
so saying her bosom she careless displayd
that seat of delight i with wonder suited
and forgot every word i designed to have said


in sullen humour one day jove
sent hermes down to idas grove
commanding cupid to deliver
his store of darts his total quiver
that hermes should the weapons break
or throw em into lethes lake


hermes you know must do his errand
he found his man producd his warrant
cupid your darts â this very hour
theres no contending against power


how sullen jupiter just now
i think i said and youll allow
that cupid was as bad as he
hear but the youngsters repartee


come kinsman said the little god
put off your wings lay by your rod
retire with me to yonder bower
and rest yourself for half an hour
tis far indeed from hence to heaven
but you fly fast and tis but seven
well take one cooling cup of nectar
and drink to this celestial hector


he break my dart or hurt my power
he ledas swan and danaes shower
go bid him his wifes tongue restrain
and mind his thunder and his rain â
my darts o certainly ill give em
from cloes eyes he shall receive em
theres one the best in all my quiver
twang through his very heart and liver
he then shall pine and sigh and rave
good lord what bustle shall we have


neptune must straight be sent to sea
and flora summond twice a day
one must find shells and tother flowers
for cooling grots and fragrant bowers
that cloe may be servd in state
the hours must at her toilet wait
whilst all the reasoning fools below
wonder their watches go too slow
lybs must fly south and eurus east
for jewels for her hair and breast


no matter though their cruel haste
sink cities and lay forests waste
no matter though this fleet be lost
or that lie windbound on the coast
what whispering in my mothers ear
what care that juno should not hear
what woik among you scholar gods
phcebus must write him amrous odes


and thou poor cousin must compose
his letters in submissive prose
whilst haughty cloe to sustain
the honour of my mystic reign
shall all his gifts and vows disdain
and laugh at your old bullys pain
dear couz said hermes in a fright
for heavens sake keep your darts good night


resolve me cloe what is this
or forfeit me one precious kiss
tis the first oflfspring of the graces
bears difterent forms in different places
acknowledgd fine whereer beheld
yet fancied finer when conceald
twas floras wealth and circes charm
pandoras box of good and harm
twas marss wish endymions dream
apelles draught and ovids theme
this guided theseus through the maze
and sent him home with life and praise
but this undid the phiygian boy
and blew the flames that ruind troy
this showd great kindness to old greece
and helpd rich jason to the fleece
this through the east just vengeance hurld
and lost poor anthony the world


injurd though lucrece found her doom
this banishd tyranny from rome
appeasd though lais gaind her hire
this set persepolis on fire
for this alcides learnd to spin
his club laid down and lions skin
for this apollo deignd to keep
witli servile care a mortals sheep


for this the father of the gods
content to leave his high abodes
in borrowd figures loosely ran
europas bull and ledas swan
for this hereassumes the nod
while semele commands the god
launches the bolt and shakes the poles
though momus laughs and juno scolds


here listening cloe smild and said
your riddle is not hard to read
a guess it â fair one if you do
need i alas i the theme pursue
for this thou seest for this i leave
whateer the world thinks wise or grave


ambition business friendship news
my useful books and serious muse
for this i willingly decline
the mirth of feasts and joys of wine
and choose to sit and talk with thee
as thy groat orders may decree
of cocks and bulls and flutes and fiddles
of idle tales and foolish riddles


what nymph should i admire or trust
but cloe beauteous cloe just
what nymph should i desire to see
but her who leaves the plain for me
to whom should i compose the lay
but her who listens when i play
to whom in song repeat my cares
but her who in my sorrow shares
for whom should i the garland make
but her who joys the gift to take
and boasts she wears it for my sake
in love am i not fully blest
lisetta prythee tell the rest


sure cloe just and cloe fair
deserves to be your only care
but when you and she today
far into the wood did stray
and i happend to pass by
which way did you cast your eye
but when your cares to her you sing
yet dare not tell her whence they spring


does it not more afflict your heart
that in those cares she bears a part
when you the flowers for cloe twine
why do you to her garland join
the meanest bud that falls from mine
simplest of swains the world may see
whom cloe loves and who loves me


the pride of every grove i chose
the violet sweet and lily fair
the dappled pink and blushing rose
to deck my charming cloes hair


at morn the nymph vouchsafd to place
upon her brow the various wreath
the flowers less blooming than her face
the scent less fragrant than her breath


the flowers she wore along the day
and every nymph and shepherd said
that in her hair they lookd more gay
than glowing in their native bed


undrest at evening when she found
their odours lost their colours past
she changd her look and on the ground
her garland and her eye she cast


that eye dropt sense distinct nnd clear
as any muses tongue could speak
when from its lid a pearly tear
ran trickling down her beauteous cheek


dissembling what i knew too well
my love my life said i explain
this change of humour prythee tell
that falling tear â what does it mean


she sighd she smild and to the flowers
pointing the lovely moralist said
see friend in some few fleeting hours
see yonder what a change is made


ah me the blooming pride of may
and that of beauty are but one
at morn both flourish bright and gay
both fade at evening pale and gone


at dawn poor stella dancd and sung
the amorous youth around her bowd
at night her fatal knell was rung
i saw and kissd her in her shroud


such as she is who died today
such i alas may be tomorrow
go damon bid thy muse display
the justice of thy cloes sorrow


venus take my votive glass
since i am not what i was
what from this day i shall be
venus let me never see


forbear to ask me why i weep
vexd cloe to her shepherd said
tis for my two poor stiaggling sheep
perhaps or for my squirrel dead


for mind i what you late have writ
your subtle questions and replies
emblems to teach a female wit
the ways where changing cupid flies


your riddle purposd to rehearse
the general power that beauty has
but why did no peculiar verse
describe one charm of cloes face


the glass avhich was at venus shrine
with such mysterious sorrow laid
the garland and you call it mine
which showd how youth and beauty fade


ten thousand trifles light as these
nor can my rage nor anger move
she should be humble who would please
and she must suffer who can love


when in my glass i chancd to look
of venus what did i implore
that every grace which thence i took
should know to charm my damon more


reading thy verse who heeds said i
if here or there his glances flew
o free for ever be his eye
whose heart to me is always true


my bloom indeed my little flower
of beauty quickly lost its pride
for severd from its native bower
it on thy glowing bosom died


yet card i not what might presage
or withering wreath or fleeting youth
love i esteemd more strong than age
and time less permanent than truth


why then i weep forbear to know
fall uncontrolld my tears and free
o damon tis the only woe
i ever yet conceald from thee


the secret wound with which i bleed
shall lie wrapt up een in my hearse
but on my tombstone thou shalt read
my answer to thy dubious verse


yes fairest proof of beautys power
dear idol of my panting heart
nature points this my fatal hour
and i have livd and we must part


while now i take my last adieu
heave thou no sigh nor shed a tear
lest yet my halfclosd eye may view
on earth an object worth its care


from jealousys tormenting strife
for ever be thy bosom freed
that nothing may disturb thy life
content a hasten to the dead


yet when some betterfated youth
shall with his amorous parley move thee
reflect one moment on his truth
avho dying thus persists to love thee


dear cloe how blubberd is that pretty face
thy cheek all on fire and thy hair all uncurld
prythee quit this caprice and as old falstaff says
let us een talk a little like folks of this world


how canst thou presume thou hast leave to destroy
the beauties which venus but lent to thy keeping
those looks were designd to inspire love and joy
more ordnary eyes may serve people for weeping


to be vexd at a trifle or two that i writ
yourj udgment at once and my passion you wrong
you take that for fact which will scarce be found wit
odds life must one swear to the truth of a song


what i speak my fair cloe and what i write shows
the difference there is betwixt nature and art
i court others in verse but i love thee in prose
and they have my whimsies but thou hast my heart


the god of us versemen you know child the sun
how after his journeys he sets up his rest
if at morning oer earth tis his fancy to run
at night he declines on his thetiss breast


so when i am wearied with wandering all day
to thee my delight in the evening i come
no matter what beauties i saw in ray way
they were but my visits but thou art my home


then finish dear cloe this pastoral war
and let us like horace and lydia agree
for thou art a girl as much brighter than her
as he was a poet sublimer than me


the trojan swain had judgd the great dispute
and beautys power obtaind the golden fruit
when venus loose in all her naked charms
met joves great daughter clad in shining arms
the wanton goddess vievvd the warlike maid
from head to foot and tauntingly she said


my heart with her but as guestwise sojournd
and now to helen it is lionie returnd


yield sister rival yield naked you see
a vanquish guess how potent i should be
if to the field i came in armour drest
dreadful like thine my shield and terrible my crest


the warrior goddess with disdain replied
thy folly child is equal to thy pride
let a brave enemy for once advise
and venus if tis possible be wise
thou to be strong must put off every dress
thy only armour is thy nakedness
and niore than once or thou art much belied
by mars himself that armour has been tried


from public noise and factious strife
from all the busy ills of life
take me my celia to thy breast
and lull my wearied soul to rest
for ever in this humble cell
let thee and i my fair one dwell


none enter else but love and he
shall bar the door and keep the key
to painted roofs and shining spires
uneasy scats of high desires
let the unthinking many crowd
that dare be covetous and proud


in golden bondage let them wait
and barter happiness for state
but oh my celia when thy swain
desires to see a court again
may heaven around this destind head
the choicest of its curses shed
to sum up all the rage of fate
in the two things i dread and hate
mayst thou be false and i be great


thus on his celias panting breast
fond celadon his soul expressd
while with delight the lovely maid
receivd the vows she thus repaid
hope of my age joy of my youth
blest miracle of love and truth
all that could eer be counted mine
my love and life long since are thine


a real joy i never knew
till i believd thy passion true
a real grief i neer can find
till thou provst perjurd or unkind
contempt and poverty and care
all we abhor and all we fear
blest with thy presence i can bear
through waters and through flames ill go
sufferer and solace of thy woe


trace me some yet unheardof way
that i thy ardour may repay
and make my constant passion known
by more than woman yet has done


had i a wish that did not bear
the stamp and image of my dear
id pierce my heart through every vein
and die to let it out again
no venus shall my witness be
if venus ever lovd like me
that for one hour i would not quit
my shepherds arms and this retreat


to be the persian monarchs bride
partner of all his power and pride
or rule in regal state above
mother of gods and wife of jove


o happy these of human race
but soon alas our pleasures pass
he thankd her on his bended knee
then drank a quart of milk and tea
and leaving her adord embrace
hastend to court to beg a place


while she his absence to bemoan
the very moment he was gone
calld thyrsis from beneath the bed
where all tliis time he had been hid


while men have these ambitious fancies
and wanton wenches read romances
our sex will â what out with it lie
and theirs in equal strains reply


the moral of the tale i sing
a posy for a wedding ring
in tliis short verse will be confind
ixve is a jest and vows are wind


miss danae when fair and young
as horace has divinely sung
could not be kept from joves embrace
by doors of steel and walls of brass
the reason of the thing is clear
would jove the naked truth aver
cupid was with him of the party
and showd himself sincere and hearty


for give that whipster but his errand
he takes my lord chief justice warrant
dauntless as death away he walks
breaks the doors open snaps the locks
searches the parlour chamber study
nor stops till he has culprits body


since this has been authentic truth
by age deliverd down to youth
tell us mistaken husband tell us
why so mysterious why so jealous
does the restraint the bolt the bar
make us less curious her less fair
the spy which does this treasure keep
does she neer say her prayers nor sleep


does she to no excess incline
does she fly music mirth and wine
or have not gold and flattery power
to purchase one unguarded hour


your care does farther yet extend
that spy is guarded by your friend â
but has this friend nor eye nor heart
may he not feel the cruel dart
which soon or late all mortals feel
may he not with too tender zeal
give the fair prisner cause to see
how much he wishes she avere free


may he not craftily infer
the rules of friendship too severe
which chain him to a hated trust
which make him wretched to be just


and may not she this darling she
youthful and healthy flesh and blood
easy with him ill usd by thee
allow this logic to be good


sir avill your questions never end
a trust to neither spy nor friend
in short a keep her from the sight
of every human face â shell write
from pen and paper shes debarrd
has she a bodkin and a card
shell prick her mind â she will you say
but how shall she that mind convey
i keep her in one room i lock it
the key look here is in this pocket
the keyhole is that left most certain
shell thrust her letter through â sir martin


dear angry friend what must be done
is there no way â there is but one
send her abroad and let her see
that all this mingled mass which she
being forbidden longs to know
is a dull farce an empty show
powder and pocketglass and beau
a staple of romance and lies
false tears and real perjuries


where sighs and looks are bought and sold
and love is made but to be told
where the fat bawd and lavish heir
the spoils of ruind beauty share
and youth seducd from friends and fame
must give up age to want and shame
let her behold the frantic scene
the women wretched false the men
and when these certain ills to shun
she would to thy embraces run
receive her with extended arms
seem more delighted with her charms
wait on her to the park and play
put on good humour make her gay
be to her virtues very kind
be to her faults a little blind
let all her ways be unconfind
and clap your padlock â on her mind


hans carvel impotent and old
married a lass of london mould
handsome enough extremely gay
lovd music company and play
high flights she had and wit at will
and so her tongue lay seldom still
for in all visits who but she
to argue or to repartee


she made it plain that human passion
was orderd by predestination
that if weak women went astray
their stars were more in fault than they
whoe tragedies she had by heart
enterd into roxanas part


to triumph in her rivals blood
the action certainly was good
how like a vine young ammon curld i
oh that deal conqueror of the world
she pitied betterton in age
that ridiculd the godlike rage


she first of all the town was told
where nevcst india things were sold
so in a morning without bodice
slipt sometimes out to mrs thodys
to cheapen tea to buy a screen
what else could so much virtue mean


for to prevent the least reproach
betty went with her in the coach


but when no very great affair
excited her peculiar care
she without fail was wakd at ten
drank chocolate then slept again
at twelve she rose with much ado
her clothes were huddled on by two
then does my lady dine at home
yes sure â but is the colonel come
next how to spend the afternoon
and not come home again too soon
the change the city or the play
as each was proper for the day
a turn in summer to hyde park
when it grew tolerably dark


wifes pleasure causes husbands pain
strange fancies come in hanss brain
he thought of what he did not name
and would reform but durst not blame
at fiist he therefore preaclid his wife
the comforts of a pious life
told her how transient beauty was
that all must die and flesh was grass
he bought her sermons psalms and graces
and doubled down the useful places
pjut still the weight of worldly care
allowd her little time for prayer
and cleopatra was read oer
while scot and wakef and twenty more


that teach one to deny oneself
stood unmolested on the shelf


an untouchd bible gracd her toilet
no fear that thumb of hers should spoil it


in short the trade was still the same
the dame went out the colonel came


whats to be done poor carvel cried
another battery must be tried
what if to spells i had recourse
tis but to hinder something worse
the end must justify the means
he only sins who ill intends
since therefore tis to combat evil
tis lawful to employ the devil


forthwith the devil did appear
for name him and hes always near
not in the shape in which he plies
at misss elbow when she lies
or stands before the nursery doors
to take the naughty boy that roars
but without saucereye or claw
like a grave barrister at law


hans carvel lay aside your grief
the devil says i bring relief
relief says hans pray let me crave
your name sir â satan â sir your slave


i did not look upon your feet
youll pardon me ay now i seet


and pray sir when came you from hell
our friends there did you leave them well


all well but prythee honest hans
says satan leave your complaisance


the truth is this i cannot stay
flaring in sunshine all the day


for entre nous we hellish sprites
love more the fresco of the nights


and oftener our receipts convey
in dreams than any other way


i tell you therefore as a friend
ere morning dawns your fears shall end


go then this evening master carvel
lay down your fowls and broach your barrel


let friends and wine dissolve your care
whilst i the great receipt prepare â


tonight ill bring it by my faith
believe for once what satan saith


away went hans glad not a little
obeyd the devil to a tittle
invited friends some half a dozen
the colonel and my ladys cousin
the meat was servd the bowls were crownd
catches were sung and healths went round
barbadoes waters for the close
till hans had fairly got his dose
the colonel toasted to the best
the dame movd off to be undiest
the chimes went twelve the guests withdrew
but wheji or how hans hardly knew
some modern anecdotes aver
he nodded in his elbow chair
fom thence was carried off to bed
john held his heels and nan his head
my lady was disturbd new sorrow
which hans must answer for tomorrow
in bed then view this happy pair
and think how hymen triumphd there


hans fast asleep as soon as laid
the duty of the night unpaid
the waking dame with thoughts opprest
that made her hate both him and rest
by such a husband such a wife
twas acmes and septimius life
the lady sighd the lover snord
the punctual devil kept his word
appear d to honest hans again
but not at all by madam seen
and giving him a magic ring
fit for the finger of a king
dear hans said he this jewel take
and wear it long for satans sake
twill do your business to a hair
for long as you this ring shall wear
as sure as i look over lincoln
that neer shall iiappen which you think on
hans took the ring with joy extreme
all this was only in a dream


and thrusting it beyond his joint
tis done he cried ive gaind my point â
what point said she you ugly beast
you neither give me joy nor rest
tis done â whats done you drunken bear
youve thrust your finger gd knows where


fire water woman are mans ruin
says wise professor vander bruin
by flames a house i hird was lost
last year and i must pay the cost
this spring the rains oerflowd my ground
and my best flanders mare was drownd
a slave i am to claras eyes
the gipsy knows her power and flies
fire water woman are my ruin
and great thy wisdom vander bruin


beyond the fixd and settled rules
of vice and virtue in the schools
beyond the letter of the law
which keeps our men and maids in awe
the better sort should set before em
a grace a manner a decorum
something that gives their acts a light
makes em not only just but bright
and sets them in that open fame
which witty malice cannot blame


for tis in life as tis in painting
much may be right yet much be wanting
from lines drawn true our eye may trace
a foot a knee a hand a face
may justly own the picture wrought
exact to rule exempt from fault
yet if the colouring be not there
the titian stroke the guido air
to nicest judgment show the piece
at best twill only not displease


it â nould not gain on jerseys eye
bradford would frown and set it by
thus in the picture of our mind
the action may be well designd
guided by law and bound by duty
yet want this je ne say quoi of beauty


and though its error may be such
as knags and burgess cannot hit
it yet may feel the nicer touch
of wycherleys or congreves w it


what is this talk replies a friend
and where will this dry moral end
the truth of what you here lay down
by some example should be shown
with all my heart â for once read on
n honest but a simple pair
and twenty other i forbear
may serve to make this thesis clear


a doctor of great skill and fame
paulo purganti was his name
had a good comely virtuous wife
no woman led a better life
she to intrigues was een hardhearted
she chuckled when a bawd was carted
and thought the nation neer would thrive
till all the avhores were burnt alive


on married men that dard be bad
she thought no mercy should be had


they should be hangd or starvd or flead
or servd hke romish priests in swede
in short all lewdness she defied
and stift was her parochial pride


yet in an honest way the dame
was a great lover of that same
and could from scripture take her cue
that husbands should give wives their due


her prudence did so justly steer
between the gay and the severe
that if in some regards she chose
to curb poor paulo in too close
in others she relaxd again
and governd witli a looser rein


thus though she strictly did confine
the doctor from excess of wine
with oysters eggs and vermicelli
she let him almost burst his belly
thus drying coftee was denied
but chocolate that loss supplied
and for tobacco who could bear it
filthy concomitant of claret
blest revolution one might see
eringo roots and bohea tea


she often set the doctors band
and strokd his beard and squeezd his hand
kindly complaiud that after noon
he went to pore on books too soon
she held it wholesomer by much
to rest a little on the couch


about his waist in bed anights
she ching so close â for fear of sprites


the doctor undeistood the call
but had not always wherewithal


the lions skin too short you know
as plutarchs morals finely show
was lengthend by the foxs tail
and art supplies where strength may fail


unwilling then in arms to meet
the enemy he could not beat
he strove to lengthen the campaign
and save his forces by chicane
fabius the roman chief who thus
by fair retreat grew maximus
shows us that all the warrior can do
with force inferior is cunctando


one day then as the foe drew near
with love and joy and life and dear
our don who knew this tittletattle
did sure as trumpet call to battle
thought it extremely a propos
to ward against the coming blow
to ward but how ay theres the question
fierce the assault unarmd the bastion


the doctor feignd a strange surprise
he felt her pulse he viewd her eyes
that beat too fast these rolld too quick
she was he said or would be sick
he judgd it absolutely good
that she should purge and cleanse her blood


spa waters for that end were got
if they passd easily or not
what matters it the ladys fever
continued violent as ever


for a distemper of this kind
blackraore and hanst are of my mind
if once it youthful blood infects
and chiefly of the female sex
is scarce removd by pill or potion
whateer might be our doctors notion


one luckless night then as in bed
the doctor and the dame were laid
again this cruel fever came
high pulse short breath and blood in flame


what measures shall poor paulo keep
with madam in this piteous taking
she like macbeth has murderd sleep
and wont allow him rest though waking


sad state of matters when we dare
nor ask for peace nor ofter war
nor livy nor comines have shown
what in this juncture may be done
grotius might own that paulos case is
harder than any which he places
amongst his belli and his pacis
he strove alas lut strove in vain
by dint of logic to maintain


that all the sex was born to grieve
down to her ladyship from eve


he rangd his tropes and preachd up patience
backd his opinion with quotations


divines and morahsts and run ye on
quite through from seneca to banyan


as much in vain he bid her try
to fold her arms and close her eye


telling her rest would do her good
if any thing in nature could


so held the greeks quite down from galen
masters and princes of their calling


so all our modern friends maintain
though no great greeks in warwicklane


reduce my muse the wandering song
a tale should never be too long


the more he talkd the more she burnd
and sighd and tossd and groand and turnd
at last i wish said she my dear
and whisperd something in his ear
you wish wish on the doctor cries
lord when will womankind be wise
what in youi waters are you mad
why poison is not half so bad
ill do it but i give you warning
youll die before tomorrow morning
tis kind my dear what you advise
the lady with a sigh replies
but life you know at best is pain
and death is what we shouhl disdain


so do it therefore and adieu
for i will die for love of you
let wanton wives by death be scard
but to my comfort im prepard


the sceptics think twas long ago
since gods came down incognito
to see who were their friends or foes
and how our actions fell or rose
that since they gave things their beginning
and set this whirligig a spinning
supine they in their heaven remain
exempt from passion and from pain
and frankly leave us human elves
to cut and shuffle for ourselves


the poets now and painters hold
this thesis both absurd and bold
and your goodnaturd gods they say
descend some twice or thrice aday
else all these things we toil so hard in
would not avail one singlo farthing
for when the hero we rehearse
to grace his actions and our verse


tis not by dint of human thought
that to his latium he is brought
iris descends by fates commands
to guide his steps through foreign lands
and amphitrite clears the way
from rocks and quicksands in the sea


and if you see him in a sketch
though drawn by paulo or carache
he sheus not half his force and strength
strutting in armour and at length
that he may take his proper figure
the piece must yet be four yards bigger
the nymphs conduct him to the field
one holds his âvord and one his shield
mars standing by asserts his quarrel
and fame flies after with a laurel


these points i say of speculation
as twere to save oi sink the nation
men idly learned will dispute
assert object confirm refute
each mighty angiy mighty right
with equal arms sustains the fight
till now no umpire can agree em
so both draw off and sing te deum


is it in equilibrio
if deities descend or no
then let the affirmative prevail
as requisite to form my tale
for by all parties tis confest
that those opinions are the best


which in their nature most conduce
to present ends and private use


two gods came therefore from above
one mercury the other jove
the humour was it seems to know
if all the favours they bestow
could from our own perverseness ease us
and if our wish enjoyd would please us


discoursing largely on this theme
oer hills and dales their godships came
till well nigh tird and almost night
they thought it proper to alight


note here that it as true as odd is
that in disguise a god or goddess
exerts no supernatural powers
but acts on maxims much like ours


they spied at last a country farm
where all was snug and clean and avarm
for woods before and hills behind
securd it both from rain and wind


large oxen in the fields were lowing
good grain was sowd good fruit was growing
of last years corn in barns gieat store
fat turkeys gobbling at the door
and wealth in short with peace consented
that people here should live contented
but did they in effect do so
have patience friend and thou shall know


the honest farmer and his wife
to yeais declind from prime of life
had struggled with the marriage noose
as almost every couple does
sometimes my plague sometimes my darling
kissing today tomorrow snarling
jointly submitting to endure
that evil which admits no cure


our gods the outward gates unbarrd
our fanner met em in the yard


thought they were folks that lost their way
and askd them civilly to stay


told em for supper or for bed
they might go on and be worse sped


so said so done the gods consent
all three into the parlour went
they compliment they sit they chat
fight oer the wars reform the state
a thousand knotty points they clear
till supper and my wife appear


jove made his leg and kissd the dame
obsequious hermes did the same
jove kissd the farmers wife you say
he did â but in an honest way
oh not with half that warmth and life
with which he kissd amphitryons wife


well then things handsomely were servd
my mistress for the strangers carvd
how strong the beer how good the meat
how loud they laughd how much they eat
in epic sumptuous would appear
vet shall be passd in silence here


for i should grieve to have it said
that by a fine description led


i made my episode too long
or tird my friend to grace my song


the gracecup servd the cloth away
jove thought it time to show his play
landlord and landlady he cried
folly and jesting laid aside
that ye thus hospitably live
and strangers with good clieor receive
is mighty grateful to your betters
and makes een gods themselves your debtors


to give this thesis plainer proof
you have tonight beneath your roof
a pair of gods nay never wonder
this youth can fly and i can thunder
im jupiter and he merciirius
my page my son indeed but spurious
form then three wishes you and madam
and sure as you already had oni
the things desird in half an hour
shall all be here and in your power


thank ye great gods the woman says
oh may your altars ever blaze
a ladle for our silver dish
is what i want is avhat i wish â
a ladle cries the man a ladle
odzooks corisca you have prayd ill
what should be great you turn to farce
i wish the ladle in your arse


the ladle fell into the room
aud stuck in old coriscas bum
iir couple weep two wishes past
and kindly join to form the last
to ease the womans awkward pain
and aet the ladle out asain


this commoner has worth and parts
is praisd for arms or lovd for arts
his head aches for a coronet
and who is blessd that is not great


some sense and more estate kind heaven
to this welllotted peer has given
what then he must have rule and sway
and all is avrong till hes in play


the miser must make up his plum
and dares not touch the hoarded sum
the sickly dotard wants a wife
to diav off his last dregs of life


against our peace we arm our will
amidst our plenty something still
for horses houses pictines planting
to thee to me to him is wanting
that cruel something unpossessd
oriodes and leavens all the rest


that something if we could obtain
would soon create a future pain
and to the coffin from the cradle
tis all a wish and all a ladle


of all that william rules or robe
describes great rhea of thy globe
when or on posthorse or in chaise
with much expense and little ease
my destind miles i shall have gone
by thames or maese by po or rhone
and found no foot of earth my own
great mother let me once be able
to have a garden house and stable
that i may read and ride and plant
superior to desire or want


and as health fails and years increase
sit down and think and die in peace
oblige thy favourite undertakers
to throw me in but twenty acres
this number sure they may allow
for asture ten and ten for plow
tis all that a avould wish or hope
for me and john and nell and crop


then as thou wilt dispose the rest
and let not fortune spoil the jest
to those who at the marketrate
can barter honour for estate


now if thou grantst me my request
to make thy votaiy truly blest
let curst revenge and saucy pride
to some bleak rock far off be tied
nor eer approach my rural seat
to tempt me to be base and great


and goddess this kind office done
charge venus to command her son
whereever else she lets him rove
to shun ni house my field my grove
peace cannot dwell with hate or love


hear gracious rhea what i say
and thy petitioner shall pray


whateer thy countrymen have done
by law and wit by sword and gun


in thee is faithfully recited
and all the living world that view
thy work give thee the praises due
at once instructed and delighted


yet for the fume of all these deeds
what beggar in the invalides


with lameness broke with blindness smitten
wishd ever decently to die
to have been either mezeray
or any monarch he has written


its strange dear author yet it true is
that down from pharamond to louis


all covet life yet call it pain
all feel the ill yet shun the cure
can sense this paradox endure
resolve me cambray or fontaine


the man in graver tragic known
though his best part long since was done


still on the stage desires to tarry
and he who playd the harlequin
after the jest still loads the scene
unwilling to retire though weary


blest be the princes who have fought
for pompous names or wide dominion
since by their error we arc taught
that happiness is but opinion


fuor little pretty fluttering thing
must we no longer live together
and dost thou prune thy trembling wing
to take thy flight thou knowst not whither


thy humorous vein thy pleasing folly
lies all neglected nil forgot
and pensive wavering melancholy
thou dreadst and hopt thou knowst not what


in awful pomp and melancholy state
âsee settled reason on the judgment seat
around her crowd distrust and doubt and fear
and thoughtful foresight and tormenting care
far from the throne the trembling pleasures stand
chaind up or exild by her stern command
wretched her subjects gloomy sits the queen
till happy chance reverts the cruel scene
and apish folly with her wild resort
of wit and jest disturbs the solemn court


see the fantastic minstrelsy advance
to breathe the song and animate the dance
blest the usurper happy the surprise
her mimic postures catch our eager eyes
her jingling bells affect our captive ear
and in the sights we see and sounds we hear
against our judgment she our sense employs
the laws of troubled reason she destroys
and in her place rejoices to indite
wild schemes of mirth and plans of loose delight


forgive the muse who in unhallovvd strains
the saint one moment from his god detains
for sure whateer you do whereer you are
tis all but one good work one constant prayer
forgive her and intreat that god to whom
thy favourd vows with kind acceptance come
to raise her notes to that sublime degree
which suits a song of piety and thee


wondrous good man whose labours may repel
the force of sin may stop the rage of hell
thou like the baptist from thy god wast sent
the cring voice to bid the world repent


the youth shall study and no more engage
their flattering wishes for uncertain age
no more with fruitless care and cheated strife
chase fleeting pleasure through this maze of life
finding the wretched all they here can have
but present food and but a future grave
each great as philips victor son shall view
this abject world and weeping ask a new
decrepid age shall read thee and confess
thy labours can assuage where medicines cease


shall bless thy words their wounded souls relief
the drops that sweeten their last dregs of life
shall look to heaven and laugh at all beneath
own riches gatherd trouble fame a breath
and life an ill whose only cure is death


thy even thoughts with so much plainness flow
their sense untutord infancy may know
yet to such height is all that plainness wrought
wit may admire and letterd pride be taught


easy in words thy style in sense sublime
on its blest steps each age and sex may rise
tis like the ladder in the patriarchs dream
its foot on earth its height above the skies
diflusd its virtue boundless is its power
tis public health and universal cure
of heavenly manna tis a second feast
a nations food and all to every taste


to its last height mad britains guilt was reard
and various death for various crimes she feard
with your kind work her drooping hopes revive
you bid her read repent adore and live
you wrest the bolt from heavens avenging hand
stop ready death and save a sinking land


o save us still still bless us with thy stay
o want thy heaven till we have learnt the way
refuse to leave thy destind charge too soon
and for the churchs good defer thy own
o live and let thy works urge our belief
live to explain thy doctrine by thy life
till future infancy baptizd by thee
grow ripe in yeais and old in piety
till christians yet unborn be taught to die


then in full age and hoary holiness
retire great teacher to thy promisd bliss
untouchd thy tomb uninjurd be thy dust
as thy own fame among the future just
till in last sounds the dreadful trumpet speaks
till judgment calls and quickend nature wakes
till through the utmost earth and deepest sea
our scatterd atoms find their destind way
in haste to clothe their kindred souls again
perfect our state and build immortal man
then fearless thou who well sustainst the fight
to paths of joy or tracts of endless light


lead up all those who heard thee and believd
midst thy own flock great shepherd be receivd
and glad all heaven with millions thou hast savd


thy elder look great janus cast
into the long records of ages past
review the years in fairest action dressd
with noted white superior to the rest


ras derive and chronicles begun
from empires founded and from battles avon
show ail the spoils by valiant kings achievd
and groaning nations by their arms relievd
the wounds of patriots in their countrys cause
and happy power sustaind by wholesome laws
in comely rank call every merit forth
imprint on eveiy act its standard worth
the glorious parallels then downward bring
to modern wonders and to britains king
with equal justice and historic care
their laws their toils their arms with his compare
confess the various attributes of fame
collected and complete in williams name


to all the listening world relate
as thou dost his story read
that nothing went before so great
and nothing greater can succeed


thy native latium was thy darling care
prudent in peace and terrible in war
the boldest virtues that have governd earth
from lati urns fruitful womb derive their birth


then turn to her fair written page
from dawning childhood to establishd age
the glories of her empire trace
confront the heroes of thy roman race
and let the justest palm the victors temples grace
the son of mars reducd the trembling swains
and spread his empire oer the distant plains


but yet the sabines violated charms
obscurd the glory of his rising arms
numa the rights of strict religion knew
on ever altar laid the incense due


unskilld to dart the pointed spear
or lead the forward youth to noble war


stern brutus was with too much horror good
holding his fasces staind with filial blood


fabius was wise but with excess of care
he savd his country but prolongd the war


while decius paulus curius greatly fought
and by their strict examples taught
how wild desires should be controlled
and how much brighter virtue was than gold


they scarce their swelling thirst of fame could hide
and boasted poverty with too much pride


excess in youth made scipio less reverd
and cato dying seemd to own he feard


julius with honour tamd romes foreign foes
but patriots fell ere the dictator rose


and while with clemency augustus reignd
the monarch was adord the city chaind


with justest honour be their merits dressd
but be their failings too confessd
their virtue like their tybers flood
rolling its course designd the countrys good


but oft the torrents too impetuous speed
from the low earth tore some polluting weed


and with the hlood of jove there always ran
some viler part some tincture of the man


few virtues after these so far prevail
but that their vices more than turn the scale
valour grown wild hy pride and power by rage
did the true charms of majesty impair
rome by degrees advancing more in age
shewd sad remains of what had once been fair


till heaven a better race of men supplies
and glory shoots new beams from western skies


turn then to pharamond and charlemain
and the long heroes of the gallic strain
experiencd chiefs for hardy prowess known
and bloody wreaths in venturous battles won
from the first william our great nonnan king
the bold plantagenets and tudors bring
illustrious trtues who by turns have rose
in foreign fields to check britannias foes


with happy laws her empire to sustain
and with full power assert her ambient main
but sometimes too industrious to be great
nor patient to expect the turns of fate
they opend camps deformd by civil fight
and made proud conquest trample over right
disparted britain mournd their doubtful sway
and dreaded both when neither would obey


from didier and imperial adolph trace
the glorious ofifspring of the nassau race


devoted lives to public liberty
the chief still dying or the country free
then see the kindred blood of orange flow
from warlike cornet through the loins of beau
through chalon next and there with nassau join
from rhones fair banks transplanted to the rhine
bring next the royal list of stuarts forth
undaunted minds that ruld the rugged north
till heavens decrees by ripening times are shown
till scotlands kings ascend the english throne
and the fair rivals live for ever one


janus mighty deity
be kind and as thy searching eye
does our modern story trace
finding some of stuarts race
unhappy pass their annals by
no harsh reflection let remembrance raise
forbear to mention what thou canst not praise
but as thou dwellst upon that heavenly name
to grief for ever sacred as to fame
oh read it to thyself in silence weep
and thy convulsive sorrows inward keep
lest britains grief should waken at the sound
and blood gush fresh froni her eternal wound


whither wouldst thou further look
read williams acts and close the ample book
peruse the wonders of his dawning life
how like alcides he began
with infant patience calmd seditious strife
and quelld the snakes which round his cradle ran


describe his youth attentive to alarms
by dangers formd and perfected in arms
when conqring mild when conquerd not disgracd
by wrongs not lessend nor by triumphs raisd


superior to the blind events
of little human accidents
and constant to his first decree
to curb the proud to set the injurd free
to bow the haughty neck and raise the suppliant knee


his opening years to riper manhood bring
and see the hero perfect in the king
imperious arms by manly reason swayd
and power supreme by free consent obeyd
with how much haste his mercy meets his foes
and how unbounded his forgiveness flows
with what desire he makes his subjects blessd
his favours granted ere his throne addressd
what trophies oer our captivd hearts he rears
by arts of peace more potent than by wars
how oer himself as oer the world he reigns
his morals strencthenincr what his law ordains


through all his thread of life already spun
becoming grace and proper action run
the piece by virtues equal hand is wrought
mixt with no crime and shaded with no fault


no footsteps of the victors rage
left in the camp where william did engage


no tincture of the monarchs pride
upon the royal purple spied
his fame like gold the more tis tried
the more shall its intrinsic worth proclaim
shall pass the combat of the searching flame
and triumph oer the vanquishd heat
for ever coming out the same
and losing not its lustre nor its weight
janus be to william just
to faithful history his actions trust


command her with peculiar care
to trace each toil and comment every war


his saving wonders bid her write
in characters distinctly bright


that each revohing age may read
the patriots piety the heros deed
and still the sire inculcate to his son
transmissive lessons of the kings renown


that williams glory still may live
when all that present art can give


the pillard marble and the tablet brass
mouldering drop the victors praise


when the great monuments of his power
shall now be visible no more


whensambre shall have changd her winding flood
and children ask where namur stood


namur proud city how her towers were armd
how she contemnd the approaching foe
till she by williams trumpets was alarmd
and shook and sunk and fell beneath his blow


jove and pallas mighty powers
guided the hero to the hostile towers
perseus seemd less swift in war
when wingd with speed he flew through air
embattled nations strive in vain
the heros glory to restrain
streams armd with rocks and mountains red with fire
in vain against his force conspire
behold him from the dreadful height appear
and lo britannias lions waving there


europe freed and france repelld
the hero from the height beheld
he spake the word that war and rage should cease
he bid the maese and rhine in safety flow
and dictated a lasting peace
to the rejoicing world below
to rescud states and vindicated crowns
his equal hand prescribd their ancient bounds
ordaind avhom every province should obey
how far each monarch should extend his sway


taught em how clemency made power reverd
and that the prince belovd was truly feard
firm by his side unspotted honour stood
pleasd to confess him not so great as good
his head with brighter beams fair virtue deckd
than those wliich all his numerous crowns reflect
establishd freedom clappd her joyful wings
proclaimd the first of men and best of kings


whither would the muse aspire
with pindars rage without his fire


pardon me janus twas a fault
created by too great a thought


mindless of the god and day
i from thy altars janus stray
from thee and from myself borne far away


the fiery pegasus disdains
to mind the riders voice or hear the reins
when glorious fields and opening camps he views
he runs with an unbounded loose


hardly the muse can sit the headstrong horse
nor would she if she could check his impetuous force


with the glad noise the cliffs and valleys ring
while she through earth and air pursues the king


slie now beholds him on the belgic shore
whilst britains tears his ready help implore
dissembling for her sake his rising cares
and with wise silence pondering vengeful wars


she through the raging ocean now
views him advancing his auspicious prow
combating adverse winds and winter seas
sighing the moments that defer our ease
daring to wield the sceptres dangerous weight
and taking the command to save the state
though ere the doubtful gift can be securd
new wars must be sustaind new wounds endurd


through rough lernes camps she sounds alarms
and kingdoms yet to be redeemd by arms
in the dank marshes finds her glorious theme
and plunges after him thro boynes fierce stream
she bids the nereids run with trembling haste
to tell old ocean how the hero past
the god rebukes their fear and owns the praise
worthy that arm whose empire he obeys


back to his albion she delights to bring
the humblest victor and the kindest king
albion with open triumph would receive
her hero nor obtains his leave


firm he rejects the altars she would raise
and thanks the zeal while he declines the praise
again she follows him through belgias land
and countries often savd by williams hand
hears joyful nations bless those happy toils
which freed the people but returnd the spoils


in various views she tries her constant theme
finds him in councils and in arms the same


when certain to oercome inclind to save
tardy to vengeance and with mercy brave


sudden another scene employs her sight
she sets her hero in another light
paints his great mind superior to success
declining conquest to establish peace
she brings astrea down to earth again
and quiet brooding oer his future reign


then with unweary wing the goddess soars
east over danube and propontis shores
where jarring empires ready to engage
retard theii armies and suspend their rage
till williams word like that of fate declares
if they shall study peace or lengthen wars
how sacred his renown for equal laws
to whom the world defers its common cause
how fair his friendships and his leagues how just
whom every nation courts whom all religions trust


from the meeotis to the northern sea
the goddess wings her desperate way
see the young muscovite the mighty head
whose sovereign terror forty nations dread


enamourd with a greater monarchs praise
and passing half the earth to his embrace


but her own king she likens to his thames
with gentle course devolving fruitful streams
serene yet strong majestic yet sedate
swift without violence without terror great
each ardent nymph the rising current craves
each shepherds prayer retards the parting waves
the vales along the bank their sweets disclose
fresh flowers for ever rise and fruitful harvest grows


yet whither would th adventurous goddess go
sees she not clouds and earth and main below
minds she the dangers of the lycian coast
and fields wheie mad bellerophon was lost


or is her towering flight reclaimd
by seas from icaruss downfall namd
vain is the call and useless the advice
to wise persuasion deaf and human cries
yet upwards she incessant flies


resolvd to reach the high empyrean sphere
and tell great jove she sings his image here
to ask for william an olympic crown
to chromius strength and therons speed unknown
till lost in trackless fields of shining day
unable to discern the way
which nassaus virtue only could explore
untouchd unknown to any muse before


she from the noble precipices thrown
comes rushing with uncommon ruin down


glorious attempt unhappy fate
the song too daring and the theme too great
yet rather thus she wills to die
than in continued annals live to sing
a second hero or a vulgar king
and with ignoble safety fly
in sight of earth along a middle sky


to janus altars and the numerous throng
that round his mystic temple press
for williams life and albions peace
ambitious muse reduce the roving song
janus cast thy forward eye
future into great rheas pregnant womb
where young ideas brooding lie
and tender images of things to come


till by thy high commands releasd
till by thy hand in proper atoms dressd
in decent order they advance to light
yet then too swiftly fleet by human sight
and meditate too soon their everlasting flight


nor beaks of ships in naval triumph borne
nor standards from the hostile ramparts torn
nor trophies brought from battles won
nor oaken wreath nor mural crown


can any future honours give
to the victorious monarchs name
the plenitude of williams fame
can no accumulated stores receive
shut then auspicious god thy sacred gate
and make us happy as our king is great


be kind and with a milder hand
closing the volume of the finishd age
though noble twas an iron page
a more delightful leaf expand
free from alarms and fierce bellonas rage


bid the great months begin their joyful round
by flora some and some by ceres crownd
teach the glad hours to scatter as they fly
soft quiet gentle love and endless joy
lead forth the years for peace and plenty famd
from saturns rule and better metal namd


secure by williams care let britain stand
nor dread the bold invaders hand
from adverse shores in safety let her hear
foreign calamity and distant war
of which let her great heaven no portion bear
betwixt the nations let her hold the scale
and as she wills let either part prevail


let her glad valleys smile with wavy corn
let fleecy flocks her rising hills adorn
around her coast let strong defence be spread
let fair abundance on her breast be shed
and heavenly sweets bloom round the goddess head


where the white towers and ancient roofs did stand
remains of wolseys or great henrys hand
to age now yielding or devourd by flame
let a young phenix raise her towering head
her wings with lengthend honour let her spread
and by her greatness shew her builders fame
august and open as the heros mind
be her capacious courts designd


let every sacred pillar bear
trophies of arms and monuments of war
the king shall there in parian marble breathe
his shoulder bleeding fresh and at his feet
disarmd shall lie the threatening death
for so was saving joves decree complete
behind that angel shall be placd whose shield
savd europe in the blow repelld
on the firm basis from his oozy bed
boyne shall raise his laurelld head


and his immortal stream be known
artfully waving through the wounded stone
and thou imperial windsor stand enlargd
with all the monarchs trophies chargd
thou the fair heaven that dost the stars inclose
wliich williams bosom wears or hand bestows


on the great champions who support his throne
and virtues nearest to his own


round ormonds knee thou tiest the mystic string
that makes the knight companion to the king
from glorious camps returnd and foreign fields
bowing before thy sainted warriors shrine
fast by his great forefathers coats and shields
blazond from bohuns or from butlers line
he hangs his arms nor fears those arms should shine
with an unequal ray or that his deed
with paler glory should recede
eclipsd by theirs or lessend by the fame
een of his own maternal nassaus name


thou smiling seest great dorsets worth confest
the ray distinguishing the patriots breast
born to protect and love to help and please
sovereign of wit and ornament of peace
long as breath informs this fleeting frame
neer let me pass in silence dorsets name
neer cease to mention the continued debt
which the great patron only would forget
and duty long as life must study to acquit


renownd in thy records shall candish stand
asserting legal power and just command
to the great house thy favour shall be shown
the fathers star transmissive to the son


from thee the talbots and the seymours race
informd their sires immortal steps shall trace


happy may their sons receive
the bright reward which thou alone canst give


and if a god these lucky numbeis guide
if sure apollo oer the verse preside


jersey belovd by all for all must feel
the influence of a form and mind
where comely grace and constant virtue dwell
like mingled streams more forcible when joind


jersey shall at thy altars stand
shall there receive the azure band


that fairest mark of favour and of fame
familiar to the viliiers name


science to raise and knowledge to enlarge
be our great masters future charge


to wiite his own memoiis and leave his heirs
high schemes of government and plans of wars
by fair rewards our noble youth to raise
to emulous merit and to thirst of praise
to lead them out from ease ere opening dawn
through the thick forest and the distant lawn
where the fleet stag employs their ardent care
and chases give them images of war
to teach them vigilance by false alarms
inure them in feignd camps to real arms
practise them now to curb the turning steed
mocking the foe now to his rapid speed
to give the rein and in the full career
to draw the certain sword or send the pointed spear


let him unite his subjects hearts
planting societies for peaceful arts
some that in nature shall true knowledge found
and by experiment make precept sound


some that to morals shall recall the age
and purge from vicious dross the sinking stage
some that with care true eloquence shall teach
and to just idioms fix our doubtful speech


that from our writers distant realms may know
the thanks we to our monarch owe
and schools profess our tongue through eveiy land
that has invokd his aid or blest his hand


let his high power the drooping muses rear
the muses only can reward his care
tis they that guard the great atrides spoils
tis they that still renew ulysses toils
to them by smiling jove twas given to save
distinguishd patriots from the common grave
to them great williams glory to recall
when statues moulder and when arches fall


nor let the muses with ungrateful pride
the sources of their treasure hide
the heros virtue does the string inspire
when with big joy they strike the living lyre


on williams fame their fate depends
with him the song begins with him it ends


from this bright ejc a uence of his deed
they borrow that reflected light
with which the lasting lamp they feed
whose beams dispel the damps of envious night


through various climes and to each distant pole
in happy tides let active commerce roll
let britains ships export an annual fleece
richer than argos brought to ancient greece
returning loaden avith the shining stores
which lie profuse on either indias shores
as our high vessels pass their watery way
let all the naval world due homage pay
with hasty reverence their tophonours lower
confessing the asserted power


to whom by fate twas given with happy sway
to calm the earth and vindicate the sea


our prayers are heard our masters fleets shall go
as far as winds can bear or waters flow


new lands to make new indies to explore
in worlds unknown to plant britannias power


nations yet wild by precept to reclaim
and teach them arms and arts in williams name


with humble joy and with respectful fear
the listening people shall his story hear
the wounds he bore the dangers he sustaind
how far he conquerd and how well he reignd


shall own his mercy equal to his fame
and form their childrens accents to his name
enquiring how and when from heaven he came


their regal tyrants shall with blushes hide
their little lusts of arbitrary pride
nor bear to see their vassals tied


when williams virtues raise their opening thought
his forty years for public freedom fought
europe by his hand sustaind
his conquest by his piety restraind
and oer himself the last great triumph gaind


no longer shall their wretched zeal adore
ideas of destructive power
spirits that hurt and godheads that devour
new incense they shall bring new altars raise
and fill their temples with a strangers praise
when the great fathers character they find
visibly stampd upon the heros mind
and own a present deity confest
in valour that preservd and power that blest


through the large convex of the azure sky
for thither nature casts our common eye
fierce meteors shoot their arbitrar light
and comets march with lawless horror bright
these hear no rule no righteous order own
their influence dreaded as their ways unknown
through threatend lands they wild destruction throw
till ardent prayer averts the public woe


but the bright oib that blesses all above
the sacred fire the real son of jove
rules not his actions by capricious will
nor by ungovernd power declines to ill
fixd by just laws he goes for ever right
man knows his course and thence adores his light
janus would intreated fate conspire
to grant what britains wishes could require
above that sun should cease his way to go
ere william cease to rule and bless below


but a relentless destiny
urges all that eer was born
suatchd from her arms britannia once must mourn
the demigod the earthly half must die
yet if our incense can your wrath remove
if human prayers avail on minds above
exert great god thy interest in the sky
gain each kind power each guardian deity


that conquerd by the public vow
they bear the dismal mischief far away
o long as utmost nature may allow
let them retard the threatend day
still be our masters life thy happy care
still let his blessings with his years increase
to his laborious youth consumd in war
add lasting age adornd and crownd with peace
let twisted olive bind those laurels fast
whose verdure must for ever last


long let this growing eia bless his sway
and let our sons his present rule obey
on his sure virtue long let earth rely
and late let the imperial eagle fly
to bear the hero through his fathers sky
to ledas twins or he whose glorioiis speed
on foot prevaild or he avho tamd the steed
to hercules at length absolvd by fate
from earthly toil and above envy great
to virgils theme bright cythereas son
sire of the latian and the british throne


to all the radiant names above
reverd by men and dear to jove
late janus let the nassaustar
newborn in rising majesty appear
to triumph over vanquishd night
and guide the prosperous mariner
with everlasting beams of friendly light


say dearest villiers poor departed friend
since fleeting life thus suddenly must end
say what did all thy busy hopes avail
that anxious thou from pole to pole didst sail
ere on thy chin the springing beard began
to spread a doubtful down and promise man
what profited thy thoughts and toils and cares
in vigour more confirmd and riper years
to wake ere morning dawn to loud alarms
and march till close of night in heavy arms
to scorn the summers suns and winters snows
and search through ever clime thy countrys foes


tliat thou mightst fortune to thy side engage
that gentle peace might quell bellonas rage
and annas bounty crown her soldiers hoaiy age


in vain we think that freewilld man has power
to hasten or protract th appointed hour
our term of life depends not on our deed
before our birth our funeral was decreed
nor awd by foresight nor misled by chance
imperious death directs his ebon lance
peoples great henrys tombs and leads up holbeins dance


alike must every state and every age
sustain the universal tyrants rage
for neither williams power nor marjs charms
could or repel or pacify his arms
young churchill fell as life began to bloom
and bradfords t trembling age expects the tomb
wisdom and eloquence in vain would plead
one moments respite for the learned head
âjudges of writings and of men have died
maecenas sackville socrates and hyde
and in their various turns their sons must tread
those gloomy journeys which their sires have led


the ancient sage who did so long maintain
that bodies die but souls return again
with all the births and deaths he had in store
went out pythagoras and came no more
and modern asgyll whose capricious thought
is yet with stores of wilder notions fraught
too soon convincd shall yield that fleetingbreath
which playd so idly with the darts of death


some from the stranded vessel force their way
fearful of fate they meet it in the sea
some who escape the fury of the wave
sicken on earth and sink into a grave
in journeys or at home in war or peace
by hardships many many fall by ease
each changing season does its poison bring
rheums chill the winter agues blast the spring


wet dry cold hot at the appointed hour
all act subservient to the tyrants power
and when obedient nature knows his will
a fly a grapestone or a hair can kill


for restless proserpine for ever treads
in paths unseen oer our devoted heads
and on the spacious land and liquid main
spreads slow disease or darts afflictive pain
variety of deaths confirm her endless reign


on curst piavas banks the goddess stood
shewd her dire warrant to the rising flood
when what a long must love and long must mourn
with fatal speed was urging his return
in his dear country to disperse his care
and arm himself by rest for future war
to chide his anxious friends officious fears
and promise to their joys his elder years


oh destind head and oh severe decree
nor native country thou nor friend shalt see
nor avar hast thou to wage nor year to come
impending death is thine and instant doom


hark the imperious goddess is obeyd
winds murmur snows descend and waters spread
oh kinsman friend â oh vain are all the cries
of human voice strong destiny replies
weep you on earth for he shall sleep below
thence none return and thither all must go


whoeer thou art whom choice or business leads
to this sad river or the neighbouring meads
if thou mayst happen on the dreary shores
to iind the object which this verse deplores


cleanse the pale corpse with a religious hand
from the polluting weed and common sand
lay the dead hero graceful in a grave
the only honour he can now receive
and fragrant mould upon his body throw
and plant the warrior laurel oer his biow
light lie the earth and flourish green the bough


so may just heaven secure thy future life
from forejgn dangers and domestic strife
and when the infernal judges dismal power
from the dark urn shall throw thy destind hour
when yielding to the sentence breathless thou
and pale shalt lie as what thou buriest now
may some kind friend the piteous object see
and equal rites perform to that whichonce was thee


shine forth ye planets with distinguishd light
as when ye hallowd first this happy night
again transmit your friendly beams to earth
as when britannia joyd for annas birth
and thou propitious star whose sacred power
presided oer the monarchs natal hour


thy radiant voyages for ever run
yielding to none but cynthia and the sun
with thy fair aspect still illustrate heaven
kindly preserve what thou hast greatly given
thy influence for thy anna we implore
prolong one life and britain asks no more
for virtue can no ampler power express
than to be great in war and good in peace


for thought no higher wish of bliss can frame
than to enjoy that virtue still the same
entire and sure the monarchs rule must prove
who founds her greatness on her subjects love
who does our homage for our good require
and orders that which we should first desire


our vanquishd wills that pleasing force obey
her goodness takes our liberty away
and haughty britain yields to arbitrary sway


let the young austrian then her terrors bear
great as he is her delegate in war
let him in thunder speak to both his spains
that in these dreadful isles a woman reigns
while the bright queen does on her subjects shower
the gentle blessings of her softer power


gives sacred morals to a vicious age
to temples zeal and manners to the stage
bids the chaste imuse without a blush appear
and wit be that which heaven and she may hear


minerva thus to perseus lent her shield
secure of conquest sent him to the field
the hero acted what tlie queen ordaind
so was his fame complete and andromede unchaind


meantime amidst her native temples sate
the goddess studious of her grecians fate
taught them in laws and letters to excel
in acting justly and in writing well


thus whilst she did hei various power dispose
the world was freed from tyrants avars and woes
virtue was taught in verse and athens glory rose


since hird for life thy servile muse must sing
successive conquests and a glorious king
must of a man immortal vainly boast
and bring him laurels whatsoeer they cost
what turn wilt thou employ what colours lay
on the event of that superior day
in which one english subjects prosperous hand
so jove did will so anna did command
broke the proud column of thy masters praise
which sixty winters had conspird to raise


from the lost field a hundred standards brought
must be the work of chance and fortunes fault
bavarias stars must be accusd which shone
that fatal day the mighty work was done
with rays oblique upon the gallic sun
some demon envying france misled the fight
and mars mistook though louis orderd right


when thy young muse invokd the tuneful nine
to say how louis did not pass the rhine
what work had we with wageninghen arnheim
places that could not be reducd to rhyme
and though the poet made his last efforts
wurts â who could mention in heroic â wurts
but tell me hast thou reason to complain
of the rough triumphs of the last campaign
the danube rescued and the empire savd
say is the majesty of verse retrievd
and would it prejudice thy softer vein
to sing the princes louis and eugene


is it too hard in happy verse to place
the vans and vanders of the rhine and maes
her warriors anna sends from tweed and thames
that france may fall by more harmonious names
canst thou not hamilton or lumley bear
would ingoldsby or palmes offend thy ear
and is there not a sound in marlboroughs name
which thou and all thy brethren ought to claim


from off a hill whose concave womb reworded
a plaintful story from a sistering vale
my spirits to attend this double voice accorded
and down i laid to list the sadtuned tale
ere long espied a fickle maid full pale
tearing of papers breaking rings atwain
storming her world with sorrows wind and rain


upon her head a platted hive of straw
which fortified her visage from the sun
whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
the carcass of beauty spent and done
time had not scythed all that youth begun
nor youth all quit but spite of heavens fell rage
some beauty peepd through lattice of seard age


oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne
which on it had conceited characters
laundering the silken figures in the brine
that seasond woe had pelleted in tears
and often reading what contents it bears
as often shrieking undistinguishd woe
in clamours of all size both high and low


sometimes her levelld eyes their carriage ride
as they did battery to the spheres intend
sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
to the orbed earth sometimes they do extend
their view right on anon their gazes lend
to every place at once and nowhere fixd
the mind and sight distractedly commixd


her hair nor loose nor tied in formal plat
proclaimd in her a careless hand of pride
for some untuckd descended her sheaved hat
hanging her pale and pined cheek beside
some in her threaden fillet still did bide
and true to bondage would not break from thence
though slackly braided in loose negligence


a thousand favours from a maund she drew
of amber crystal and of beaded jet
which one by one she in a river threw
upon whose weeping margent she was set
like usury applying wet to wet
or monarchs hands that let not bounty fall
where want cries some but where excess begs all


of folded schedules had she many a one
which she perused sighd tore and gave the flood
crackd many a ring of posied gold and bone
bidding them find their sepulchres in mud
found yet moe letters sadly pennd in blood
with sleided silk feat and affectedly
enswathed and seald to curious secrecy


these often bathed she in her fluxive eyes
and often kissd and often gan to tear
cried o false blood thou register of lies
what unapproved witness dost thou bear
ink would have seemd more black and damned here
this said in top of rage the lines she rents
big discontent so breaking their contents


a reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh
sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew
of court of city and had let go by
the swiftest hours observed as they flew
towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew
and privileged by age desires to know
in brief the grounds and motives of her woe


so slides he down upon his grained bat
and comelydistant sits he by her side
when he again desires her being sat
her grievance with his hearing to divide
if that from him there may be aught applied
which may her suffering ecstasy assuage
tis promised in the charity of age


father she says though in me you behold
the injury of many a blasting hour
let it not tell your judgment i am old
not age but sorrow over me hath power
i might as yet have been a spreading flower
fresh to myself if i had selfapplied
love to myself and to no love beside


but woe is me too early i attended
a youthful suitit was to gain my grace
of one by natures outwards so commended
that maidens eyes stuck over all his face
love lackd a dwelling and made him her place
and when in his fair parts she did abide
she was new lodged and newly deified


his browny locks did hang in crooked curls
and every light occasion of the wind
upon his lips their silken parcels hurls
whats sweet to do to do will aptly find
each eye that saw him did enchant the mind
for on his visage was in little drawn
what largeness thinks in paradise was sawn


small show of man was yet upon his chin
his phoenix down began but to appear
like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
whose bare outbraggd the web it seemd to wear
yet showd his visage by that cost more dear
and nice affections wavering stood in doubt
if best were as it was or best without


his qualities were beauteous as his form
for maidentongued he was and thereof free
yet if men moved him was he such a storm
as oft twixt may and april is to see
when winds breathe sweet untidy though they be
his rudeness so with his authorized youth
did livery falseness in a pride of truth


well could he ride and often men would say
that horse his mettle from his rider takes
proud of subjection noble by the sway
what rounds what bounds what course what stop he makes
and controversy hence a question takes
whether the horse by him became his deed
or he his manage by the welldoing steed


but quickly on this side the verdict went
his real habitude gave life and grace
to appertainings and to ornament
accomplishd in himself not in his case
all aids themselves made fairer by their place
came for additions yet their purposed trim
pieced not his grace but were all graced by him


so on the tip of his subduing tongue
all kinds of arguments and question deep
all replication prompt and reason strong
for his advantage still did wake and sleep
to make the weeper laugh the laugher weep
he had the dialect and different skill
catching all passions in his craft of will


that he did in the general bosom reign
of young of old and sexes both enchanted
to dwell with him in thoughts or to remain
in personal duty following where he haunted
consents bewitchd ere he desire have granted
and dialogued for him what he would say
askd their own wills and made their wills obey


many there were that did his picture get
to serve their eyes and in it put their mind
like fools that in th imagination set
the goodly objects which abroad they find
of lands and mansions theirs in thought assignd
and labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them
than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them


so many have that never touchd his hand
sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart
my woeful self that did in freedom stand
and was my own feesimple not in part
what with his art in youth and youth in art
threw my affections in his charmed power
reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower


yet did i not as some my equals did
demand of him nor being desired yielded
finding myself in honour so forbid
with safest distance i mine honour shielded
experience for me many bulwarks builded
of proofs newbleeding which remaind the foil
of this false jewel and his amorous spoil


but ah who ever shunnd by precedent
the destined ill she must herself assay
or forced examples gainst her own content
to put the bypast perils in her way
counsel may stop awhile what will not stay
for when we rage advice is often seen
by blunting us to make our wits more keen


nor gives it satisfaction to our blood
that we must curb it upon others proof
to be forbod the sweets that seem so good
for fear of harms that preach in our behoof
o appetite from judgment stand aloof
the one a palate hath that needs will taste
though reason weep and cry it is thy last


for further i could say this mans untrue
and knew the patterns of his foul beguiling
heard where his plants in others orchards grew
saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling
knew vows were ever brokers to defiling
thought characters and words merely but art
and bastards of his foul adulterate heart


and long upon these terms i held my city
till thus he gan besiege me gentle maid
have of my suffering youth some feeling pity
and be not of my holy vows afraid
thats to ye sworn to none was ever said
for feasts of love i have been calld unto
till now did neer invite nor never woo


all my offences that abroad you see
are errors of the blood none of the mind
love made them not with acture they may be
where neither party is nor true nor kind
they sought their shame that so their shame did find
and so much less of shame in me remains
by how much of me their reproach contains


among the many that mine eyes have seen
not one whose flame my heart so much as warmd
or my affection put to the smallest teen
or any of my leisures ever charmd
harm have i done to them but neer was harmd
kept hearts in liveries but mine own was free
and reignd commanding in his monarchy


look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me
of paled pearls and rubies red as blood
figuring that they their passions likewise lent me
of grief and blushes aptly understood
in bloodless white and the encrimsond mood
effects of terror and dear modesty
encampd in hearts but fighting outwardly


and lo behold these talents of their hair
with twisted metal amorously impleachd
i have received from many a several fair
their kind acceptance weepingly beseechd
with the annexions of fair gems enrichd
and deepbraind sonnets that did amplify
each stones dear nature worth and quality


the diamondwhy twas beautiful and hard
whereto his invised properties did tend
the deepgreen emerald in whose fresh regard
weak sights their sickly radiance do amend
the heavenhued sapphire and the opal blend
with objects manifold each several stone
with wit well blazond smiled or made some moan


lo all these trophies of affections hot
of pensived and subdued desires the tender
nature hath charged me that i hoard them not
but yield them up where i myself must render
that is to you my origin and ender
for these of force must your oblations be
since i their altar you enpatron me


o then advance of yours that phraseless hand
whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise
take all these similes to your own command
hallowd with sighs that burning lungs did raise
what me your minister for you obeys
works under you and to your audit comes
their distract parcels in combined sums


lo this device was sent me from a nun
or sister sanctified of holiest note
which late her noble suit in court did shun
whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote
for she was sought by spirits of richest coat
but kept cold distance and did thence remove
to spend her living in eternal love


but o my sweet what labour ist to leave
the thing we have not mastering what not strives
playing the place which did no form receive
playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves
she that her fame so to herself contrives
the scars of battle scapeth by the flight
and makes her absence valiant not her might


o pardon me in that my boast is true
the accident which brought me to her eye
upon the moment did her force subdue
and now she would the caged cloister fly
religious love put out religions eye
not to be tempted would she be immured
and now to tempt all liberty procured


how mighty then you are o hear me tell
the broken bosoms that to me belong
have emptied all their fountains in my well
and mine i pour your ocean all among
i strong oer them and you oer me being strong
must for your victory us all congest
as compound love to physic your cold breast


my parts had power to charm a sacred nun
who disciplined ay dieted in grace
believed her eyes when they to assail begun
all vows and consecrations giving place
o most potential love vow bond nor space
in thee hath neither sting knot nor confine
for thou art all and all things else are thine


when thou impressest what are precepts worth
of stale example when thou wilt inflame
how coldly those impediments stand forth
of wealth of filial fear law kindred fame
loves arms are peace gainst rule gainst sense gainst shame
and sweetens in the suffering pangs it bears
the aloes of all forces shocks and fears


now all these hearts that do on mine depend
feeling it break with bleeding groans they pine
and supplicant their sighs to you extend
to leave the battery that you make gainst mine
lending soft audience to my sweet design
and credent soul to that strongbonded oath
that shall prefer and undertake my troth


this said his watery eyes he did dismount
whose sights till then were levelld on my face
each cheek a river running from a fount
with brinish current downward flowd apace
o how the channel to the stream gave grace
who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses
that flame through water which their hue encloses


o father what a hell of witchcraft lies
in the small orb of one particular tear
but with the inundation of the eyes
what rocky heart to water will not wear
what breast so cold that is not warmed here
o cleft effect cold modesty hot wrath
both fire from hence and chill extincture hath


for lo his passion but an art of craft
even there resolved my reason into tears
there my white stole of chastity i daffd
shook off my sober guards and civil fears
appear to him as he to me appears
all melting though our drops this difference bore
his poisond me and mine did him restore


in him a plenitude of subtle matter
applied to cautels all strange forms receives
of burning blushes or of weeping water
or swooning paleness and he takes and leaves
in eithers aptness as it best deceives
to blush at speeches rank to weep at woes
or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows


that not a heart which in his level came
could scape the hail of his allhurting aim
showing fair nature is both kind and tame
and veild in them did win whom he would maim
against the thing he sought he would exclaim
when he most burnd in heartwishd luxury
he preachd pure maid and praised cold chastity


thus merely with the garment of a grace
the naked and concealed fiend he coverd
that th unexperient gave the tempter place
which like a cherubin above them hoverd
who young and simple would not be so loverd
ay me i fell and yet do question make
what i should do again for such a sake


o that infected moisture of his eye
o that false fire which in his cheek so glowd
o that forced thunder from his heart did fly
o that sad breath his spongy lungs bestowd
o all that borrowd motion seeming owed
would yet again betray the forebetrayd
and new pervert a reconciled maid


when my love swears that she is made of truth
i do believe her though i know she lies
that she might think me some untutord youth
unskilful in the worlds false forgeries
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
although i know my years be past the best
i smiling credit her falsespeaking tongue
outfacing faults in love with loves ill rest
but wherefore says my love that she is young
and wherefore say not i that i am old
o loves best habit is a soothing tongue
and age in love loves not to have years told
therefore ill lie with love and love with me
since that our faults in love thus smotherd be


two loves i have of comfort and despair
that like two spirits do suggest me still
my better angel is a man right fair
my worser spirit a woman colourd ill
to win me soon to hell my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil
wooing his purity with her fair pride
and whether that my angel be turnd fiend
suspect i may yet not directly tell
for being both to me both to each friend
i guess one angel in anothers hell
the truth i shall not know but live in doubt
till my bad angel fire my good one out


did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye
gainst whom the world could not hold argument
persuade my heart to this false perjury
vows for thee broke deserve not punishment
a woman i forswore but i will prove
thou being a goddess i forswore not thee
my vow was earthly thou a heavenly love
thy grace being gaind cures all disgrace in me
my vow was breath and breath a vapour is
then thou fair sun that on this earth doth shine
exhale this vapour vow in thee it is
if broken then it is no fault of mine
if by me broke what fool is not so wise
to break an oath to win a paradise


sweet cytherea sitting by a brook
with young adonis lovely fresh and green
did court the lad with many a lovely look
such looks as none could look but beautys queen
she told him stories to delight his ear
she showed him favors to allure his eye
to win his heart she touchd him here and there
touches so soft still conquer chastity
but whether unripe years did want conceit
or he refused to take her figured proffer
the tender nibbler would not touch the bait
but smile and jest at every gentle offer
then fell she on her back fair queen and toward
he rose and ran away ah fool too froward


if love make me forsworn how shall i swear to love
o never faith could hold if not to beauty vowd
though to myself forsworn to thee ill constant prove
those thoughts to me like oaks to thee like osiers bowd
study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes
where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend
if knowledge be the mark to know thee shall suffice
well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend
all ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder
which is to me some praise that i thy parts admire
thine eye joves lightning seems thy voice his dreadful thunder
which not to anger bent is music and sweet fire
celestial as thou art o do not love that wrong
to sing heavens praise with such an earthly tongue


scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn
and scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade
when cytherea all in love forlorn
a longing tarriance for adonis made
under an osier growing by a brook
a brook where adon used to cool his spleen
hot was the day she hotter that did look
for his approach that often there had been
anon he comes and throws his mantle by
and stood stark naked on the brooks green brim
the sun lookd on the world with glorious eye
yet not so wistly as this queen on him
he spying her bounced in whereas he stood
o jove quoth she why was not i a flood


fair is my love but not so fair as fickle
mild as a dove but neither true nor trusty
brighter than glass and yet as glass is brittle
softer than wax and yet as iron rusty
a lily pale with damask dye to grace her
none fairer nor none falser to deface her


her lips to mine how often hath she joined
between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing
how many tales to please me hath she coined
dreading my love the loss thereof still fearing
yet in the midst of all her pure protestings
her faith her oaths her tears and all were jestings


she burnd with love as straw with fire flameth
she burnd out love as soon as straw outburneth
she framed the love and yet she foild the framing
she bade love last and yet she fell aturning
was this a lover or a lecher whether
bad in the best though excellent in neither


if music and sweet poetry agree
as they must needs the sister and the brother
then must the love be great twixt thee and me
because thou lovest the one and i the other
dowland to thee is dear whose heavenly touch
upon the lute doth ravish human sense
spenser to me whose deep conceit is such
as passing all conceit needs no defence
thou lovest to hear the sweet melodious sound
that phoebus lute the queen of music makes
and i in deep delight am chiefly drownd
when as himself to singing he betakes
one god is god of both as poets feign
one knight loves both and both in thee remain


sweet rose fair flower untimely pluckd soon vaded
pluckd in the bud and vaded in the spring
bright orient pearl alack too timely shaded
fair creature killd too soon by deaths sharp sting
like a green plum that hangs upon a tree
and falls through wind before the fall should be


i weep for thee and yet no cause i have
for why thou leftst me nothing in thy will
and yet thou leftst me more than i did crave
for why i craved nothing of thee still
o yes dear friend i pardon crave of thee
thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me


venus with young adonis sitting by her
under a myrtle shade began to woo him
she told the youngling how god mars did try her
and as he fell to her so fell she to him
even thus quoth she the warlike god embraced me
and then she clippd adonis in her arms
even thus quoth she the warlike god unlaced me
as if the boy should use like loving charms
even thus quoth she he seized on my lips
and with her lips on his did act the seizure
and as she fetched breath away he skips
and would not take her meaning nor her pleasure
ah that i had my lady at this bay
to kiss and clip me till i run away


crabbed age and youth cannot live together
youth is full of pleasance age is full of care
youth like summer morn age like winter weather
youth like summer brave age like winter bare
youth is full of sport ages breath is short
youth is nimble age is lame
youth is hot and bold age is weak and cold
youth is wild and age is tame
age i do abhor thee youth i do adore thee
o my love my love is young
age i do defy thee o sweet shepherd hie thee
for methinks thou stayst too long


beauty is but a vain and doubtful good
a shining gloss that vadeth suddenly
a flower that dies when first it gins to bud
a brittle glass thats broken presently
a doubtful good a gloss a glass a flower
lost vaded broken dead within an hour


and as goods lost are seld or never found
as vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh
as flowers dead lie witherd on the ground
as broken glass no cement can redress
so beauty blemishd onces for ever lost
in spite of physic painting pain and cost


good night good rest ah neither be my share
she bade good night that kept my rest away
and daffd me to a cabin hangd with care
to descant on the doubts of my decay
farewell quoth she and come again tomorrow
fare well i could not for i suppd with sorrow
yet at my parting sweetly did she smile
in scorn or friendship nill i construe whether
t may be she joyd to jest at my exile
t may be again to make me wander thither
wander a word for shadows like myself
as take the pain but cannot pluck the pelf


lord how mine eyes throw gazes to the east
my heart doth charge the watch the morning rise
doth cite each moving sense from idle rest
not daring trust the office of mine eyes
while philomela sits and sings i sit and mark
and wish her lays were tuned like the lark


for she doth welcome daylight with her ditty
and drives away dark dismaldreaming night
the night so packd i post unto my pretty
heart hath his hope and eyes their wished sight
sorrow changed to solace solace mixd with sorrow
for why she sighd and bade me come tomorrow


were i with her the night would post too soon
but now are minutes added to the hours
to spite me now each minute seems a moon
yet not for me shine sun to succor flowers
pack night peep day good day of night now borrow
short night tonight and length thyself tomorrow


it was a lordings daughter the fairest one of three
that liked of her master as well as well might be
till looking on an englishman the fairst that eye could see
her fancy fell aturning


long was the combat doubtful that love with love did fight
to leave the master loveless or kill the gallant knight
to put in practise either alas it was a spite
unto the silly damsel


but one must be refused more mickle was the pain
that nothing could be used to turn them both to gain
for of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain
alas she could not help it


thus art with arms contending was victor of the day
which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away
then lullaby the learned man hath got the lady gay
for now my song is ended


on a day alack the day
love whose month was ever may
spied a blossom passing fair
playing in the wanton air
through the velvet leaves the wind
all unseen gan passage find
that the lover sick to death
wishd himself the heavens breath
air quoth he thy cheeks may blow
air would i might triumph so
but alas my hand hath sworn
neer to pluck thee from thy thorn
vow alack for youth unmeet
youth so apt to pluck a sweet
thou for whom jove would swear
juno but an ethiope were
and deny himself for jove
turning mortal for thy love


when as thine eye hath chose the dame
and stalld the deer that thou shouldst strike
let reason rule things worthy blame
as well as fancy partial might
take counsel of some wiser head
neither too young nor yet unwed


what though she strive to try her strength
and ban and brawl and say thee nay
her feeble force will yield at length
when craft hath taught her thus to say
had women been so strong as men
in faith you had not had it then


and to her will frame all thy ways
spare not to spend and chiefly there
where thy desert may merit praise
by ringing in thy ladys ear
the strongest castle tower and town
the golden bullet beats it down


serve always with assured trust
and in thy suit be humble true
unless thy lady prove unjust
press never thou to choose anew
when time shall serve be thou not slack
to proffer though she put thee back


the wiles and guiles that women work
dissembled with an outward show
the tricks and toys that in them lurk
the cock that treads them shall not know
have you not heard it said full oft
a womans nay doth stand for nought


think women still to strive with men
to sin and never for to saint
there is no heaven by holy then
when time with age doth them attaint
were kisses all the joys in bed
one woman would another wed


but soft enough too much i fear
lest that my mistress hear my song
she will not stick to round me i the ear
to teach my tongue to be so long
yet will she blush here be it said
to hear her secrets so bewrayd


live with me and be my love
and we will all the pleasures prove
that hills and valleys dales and fields
and all the craggy mountains yields


there will we sit upon the rocks
and see the shepherds feed their flocks
by shallow rivers by whose falls
melodious birds sing madrigals


there will i make thee a bed of roses
with a thousand fragrant posies
a cap of flowers and a kirtle
embroiderd all with leaves of myrtle


a belt of straw and ivy buds
with coral clasps and amber studs
and if these pleasures may thee move
then live with me and be my love


if that the world and love were young
and truth in every shepherds tongue
these pretty pleasures might me move
to live with thee and be thy love


as it fell upon a day
in the merry month of may
sitting in a pleasant shade
which a grove of myrtles made
beasts did leap and birds did sing
trees did grow and plants did spring
every thing did banish moan
save the nightingale alone
she poor bird as all forlorn
leand her breast uptill a thorn
and there sung the dolefullst ditty
that to hear it was great pity
fie fie fie now would she cry
tereu tereu by and by
that to hear her so complain
scarce i could from tears refrain
for her griefs so lively shown
made me think upon mine own
ah thought i thou mournst in vain
none takes pity on thy pain
senseless trees they cannot hear thee
ruthless beasts they will not cheer thee
king pandion he is dead
all thy friends are lappd in lead
all thy fellow birds do sing
careless of thy sorrowing
even so poor bird like thee
none alive will pity me
whilst as fickle fortune smiled
thou and i were both beguiled
every one that flatters thee
is no friend in misery
words are easy like the wind
faithful friends are hard to find
every man will be thy friend
whilst thou hast wherewith to spend
but if store of crowns be scant
no man will supply thy want
if that one be prodigal
bountiful they will him call
and with suchlike flattering
pity but he were a king
if he be addict to vice
quickly him they will entice
if to women he be bent
they have at commandement
but if fortune once do frown
then farewell his great renown
they that fawnd on him before
use his company no more
he that is thy friend indeed
he will help thee in thy need
if thou sorrow he will weep
if thou wake he cannot sleep
thus of every grief in heart
he with thee doth bear a part
these are certain signs to know
faithful friend from flattering foe


let the bird of loudest lay
on the sole arabian tree
herald sad and trumpet be
to whose sound chaste wings obey


but thou shrieking harbinger
foul precurrer of the fiend
augur of the fevers end
to this troop come thou not near


from this session interdict
every fowl of tyrant wing
save the eagle featherd king
keep the obsequy so strict


let the priest in surplice white
that defunctive music can
be the deathdivining swan
lest the requiem lack his right


and thou trebledated crow
that thy sable gender makest
with the breath thou givest and takest
mongst our mourners shalt thou go


here the anthem doth commence
love and constancy is dead
phoenix and the turtle fled
in a mutual flame from hence


so they loved as love in twain
had the essence but in one
two distincts division none
number there in love was slain


hearts remote yet not asunder
distance and no space was seen
twixt the turtle and his queen
but in them it were a wonder


so between them love did shine
that the turtle saw his right
flaming in the phoenix sight
either was the others mine


property was thus appalled
that the self was not the same
single natures double name
neither two nor one was called


reason in itself confounded
saw division grow together
to themselves yet either neither
simple were so well compounded


that it cried how true a twain
seemeth this concordant one
love hath reason reason none
if what parts can so remain


whereupon it made this threne
to the phoenix and the dove
cosupremes and stars of love
as chorus to their tragic scene


beauty truth and rarity
grace in all simplicity
here enclosed in cinders lie


death is now the phoenix nest
and the turtles loyal breast
to eternity doth rest


leaving no posterity
twas not their infirmity
it was married chastity


truth may seem but cannot be
beauty brag but tis not she
truth and beauty buried be


to this urn let those repair
that are either true or fair
for these dead birds sigh a prayer


from the besieged ardea all in post
borne by the trustless wings of false desire
lustbreathed tarquin leaves the roman host
and to collatium bears the lightless fire
which in pale embers hid lurks to aspire
and girdle with embracing flames the waist
of collatines fair love lucrece the chaste


haply that name of chaste unhappily set
this bateless edge on his keen appetite
when collatine unwisely did not let
to praise the clear unmatched red and white
which triumphd in that sky of his delight
where mortal stars as bright as heavens beauties
with pure aspects did him peculiar duties


for he the night before in tarquins tent
unlockd the treasure of his happy state
what priceless wealth the heavens had him lent
in the possession of his beauteous mate
reckoning his fortune at such highproud rate
that kings might be espoused to more fame
but king nor peer to such a peerless dame


o happiness enjoyd but of a few
and if possessd as soon decayd and done
as is the mornings silvermelting dew
against the golden splendor of the sun
an expired date cancelld ere well begun
honour and beauty in the owners arms
are weakly fortressd from a world of harms


beauty itself doth of itself persuade
the eyes of men without an orator
what needeth then apologies be made
to set forth that which is so singular
or why is collatine the publisher
of that rich jewel he should keep unknown
from thievish ears because it is his own


perchance his boast of lucrece sovereignty
suggested this proud issue of a king
for by our ears our hearts oft tainted be
perchance that envy of so rich a thing
braving compare disdainfully did sting
his highpitchd thoughts that meaner men should vaunt
that golden hap which their superiors want


but some untimely thought did instigate
his alltootimeless speed if none of those
his honour his affairs his friends his state
neglected all with swift intent he goes
to quench the coal which in his liver glows
o rash false heat wrappd in repentant cold
thy hasty spring still blasts and neer grows old


when at collatium this false lord arrived
well was he welcomed by the roman dame
within whose face beauty and virtue strived
which of them both should underprop her fame
when virtue braggd beauty would blush for shame
when beauty boasted blushes in despite
virtue would stain that oer with silver white


but beauty in that white intituled
from venus doves doth challenge that fair field
then virtue claims from beauty beautys red
which virtue gave the golden age to gild
their silver cheeks and calld it then their shield
teaching them thus to use it in the fight
when shame assaild the red should fence the white


this heraldry in lucrece face was seen
argued by beautys red and virtues white
of eithers colour was the other queen
proving from worlds minority their right
yet their ambition makes them still to fight
the sovereignty of either being so great
that oft they interchange each others seat


their silent war of lilies and of roses
which tarquin viewd in her fair faces field
in their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses
where lest between them both it should be killd
the coward captive vanquished doth yield
to those two armies that would let him go
rather than triumph in so false a foe


now thinks he that her husbands shallow tongue
the niggard prodigal that praised her so
in that high task hath done her beauty wrong
which far exceeds his barren skill to show
therefore that praise which collatine doth owe
enchanted tarquin answers with surmise
in silent wonder of stillgazing eyes


this earthly saint adored by this devil
little suspecteth the false worshipper
for unstaind thoughts do seldom dream on evil
birds never limed no secret bushes fear
so guiltless she securely gives good cheer
and reverend welcome to her princely guest
whose inward ill no outward harm expressd


for that he colourd with his high estate
hiding base sin in plaits of majesty
that nothing in him seemd inordinate
save something too much wonder of his eye
which having all all could not satisfy
but poorly rich so wanteth in his store
that cloyd with much he pineth still for more


but she that never coped with stranger eyes
could pick no meaning from their parling looks
nor read the subtleshining secrecies
writ in the glassy margents of such books
she touchd no unknown baits nor feard no hooks
nor could she moralize his wanton sight
more than his eyes were opend to the light


he stories to her ears her husbands fame
won in the fields of fruitful italy
and decks with praises collatines high name
made glorious by his manly chivalry
with bruised arms and wreaths of victory
her joy with heavedup hand she doth express
and wordless so greets heaven for his success


far from the purpose of his coming hither
he makes excuses for his being there
no cloudy show of stormy blustering weather
doth yet in his fair welkin once appear
till sable night mother of dread and fear
upon the world dim darkness doth display
and in her vaulty prison stows the day


for then is tarquin brought unto his bed
intending weariness with heavy spright
for after supper long he questioned
with modest lucrece and wore out the night
now leaden slumber with lifes strength doth fight
and every one to rest themselves betake
save thieves and cares and troubled minds that wake


as one of which doth tarquin lie revolving
the sundry dangers of his wills obtaining
yet ever to obtain his will resolving
though weakbuilt hopes persuade him to abstaining
despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining
and when great treasure is the meed proposed
though death be adjunct theres no death supposed


those that much covet are with gain so fond
for what they have not that which they possess
they scatter and unloose it from their bond
and so by hoping more they have but less
or gaining more the profit of excess
is but to surfeit and such griefs sustain
that they prove bankrupt in this poorrich gain


the aim of all is but to nurse the life
with honour wealth and ease in waning age
and in this aim there is such thwarting strife
that one for all or all for one we gage
as life for honour in fell battles rage
honour for wealth and oft that wealth doth cost
the death of all and all together lost


so that in venturing ill we leave to be
the things we are for that which we expect
and this ambitious foul infirmity
in having much torments us with defect
of that we have so then we do neglect
the thing we have and all for want of wit
make something nothing by augmenting it


such hazard now must doting tarquin make
pawning his honour to obtain his lust
and for himself himself be must forsake
then where is truth if there be no selftrust
when shall he think to find a stranger just
when he himself himself confounds betrays
to slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days


now stole upon the time the dead of night
when heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes
no comfortable star did lend his light
no noise but owls and wolves deathboding cries
now serves the season that they may surprise
the silly lambs pure thoughts are dead and still
while lust and murder wake to stain and kill


and now this lustful lord leapd from his bed
throwing his mantle rudely oer his arm
is madly tossd between desire and dread
th one sweetly flatters th other feareth harm
but honest fear bewitchd with lusts foul charm
doth too too oft betake him to retire
beaten away by brainsick rude desire


his falchion on a flint he softly smiteth
that from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly
whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth
which must be lodestar to his lustful eye
and to the flame thus speaks advisedly
as from this cold flint i enforced this fire
so lucrece must i force to my desire


here pale with fear he doth premeditate
the dangers of his loathsome enterprise
and in his inward mind he doth debate
what following sorrow may on this arise
then looking scornfully he doth despise
his naked armour of stillslaughterd lust
and justly thus controls his thoughts unjust


fair torch burn out thy light and lend it not
to darken her whose light excelleth thine
and die unhallowd thoughts before you blot
with your uncleanness that which is divine
offer pure incense to so pure a shrine
let fair humanity abhor the deed
that spots and stains loves modest snowwhite weed


o shame to knighthood and to shining arms
o foul dishonour to my households grave
o impious act including all foul harms
a martial man to be soft fancys slave
true valour still a true respect should have
then my digression is so vile so base
that it will live engraven in my face


yea though i die the scandal will survive
and be an eyesore in my golden coat
some loathsome dash the herald will contrive
to cipher me how fondly i did dote
that my posterity shamed with the note
shall curse my bones and hold it for no sin
to wish that i their father had not bin


what win i if i gain the thing i seek
a dream a breath a froth of fleeting joy
who buys a minutes mirth to wail a week
or sells eternity to get a toy
for one sweet grape who will the vine destroy
or what fond beggar but to touch the crown
would with the sceptre straight be strucken down


if collatinus dream of my intent
will he not wake and in a desperate rage
post hither this vile purpose to prevent
this siege that hath engirt his marriage
this blur to youth this sorrow to the sage
this dying virtue this surviving shame
whose crime will bear an everduring blame


o what excuse can my invention make
when thou shalt charge me with so black a deed
will not my tongue be mute my frail joints shake
mine eyes forego their light my false heart bleed
the guilt being great the fear doth still exceed
and extreme fear can neither fight nor fly
but cowardlike with trembling terror die


had collatinus killd my son or sire
or lain in ambush to betray my life
or were he not my dear friend this desire
might have excuse to work upon his wife
as in revenge or quittal of such strife
but as he is my kinsman my dear friend
the shame and fault finds no excuse nor end


shameful it is ay if the fact be known
hateful it is there is no hate in loving
ill beg her love but she is own
the worst is but denial and reproving
my will is strong past reasons weak removing
who fears a sentence or an old mans saw
shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe


thus graceless holds he disputation
tween frozen conscience and hotburning will
and with good thoughts make dispensation
urging the worser sense for vantage still
which in a moment doth confound and kill
all pure effects and doth so far proceed
that what is vile shows like a virtuous deed


quoth he she took me kindly by the hand
and gazed for tidings in my eager eyes
fearing some hard news from the warlike band
where her beloved collatinus lies
o how her fear did make her colour rise
first red as roses that on lawn we lay
then white as lawn the roses took away


and how her hand in my hand being lockd
forced it to tremble with her loyal fear
which struck her sad and then it faster rockd
until her husbands welfare she did hear
whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer
that had narcissus seen her as she stood
selflove had never drownd him in the flood


why hunt i then for colour or excuses
all orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth
poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses
love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth
affection is my captain and he leadeth
and when his gaudy banner is displayd
the coward fights and will not be dismayd


then childish fear avaunt debating die
respect and reason wait on wrinkled age
my heart shall never countermand mine eye
sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage
my part is youth and beats these from the stage
desire my pilot is beauty my prize
then who fears sinking where such treasure lies


as corn oergrown by weeds so heedful fear
is almost choked by unresisted lust
away he steals with open listening ear
full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust
both which as servitors to the unjust
so cross him with their opposite persuasion
that now he vows a league and now invasion


within his thought her heavenly image sits
and in the selfsame seat sits collatine
that eye which looks on her confounds his wits
that eye which him beholds as more divine
unto a view so false will not incline
but with a pure appeal seeks to the heart
which once corrupted takes the worser part


and therein heartens up his servile powers
who flatterd by their leaders jocund show
stuff up his lust as minutes fill up hours
and as their captain so their pride doth grow
paying more slavish tribute than they owe
by reprobate desire thus madly led
the roman lord marcheth to lucrece bed


the locks between her chamber and his will
each one by him enforced retires his ward
but as they open they all rate his ill
which drives the creeping thief to some regard
the threshold grates the door to have him heard
nightwandering weasels shriek to see him there
they fright him yet he still pursues his fear


as each unwilling portal yields him way
through little vents and crannies of the place
the wind wars with his torch to make him stay
and blows the smoke of it into his face
extinguishing his conduct in this case
but his hot heart which fond desire doth scorch
puffs forth another wind that fires the torch


and being lighted by the light he spies
lucretias glove wherein her needle sticks
he takes it from the rushes where it lies
and griping it the needle his finger pricks
as who should say this glove to wanton tricks
is not inured return again in haste
thou seest our mistress ornaments are chaste


but all these poor forbiddings could not stay him
he in the worst sense construes their denial
the doors the wind the glove that did delay him
he takes for accidental things of trial
or as those bars which stop the hourly dial
who with a lingering slay his course doth let
till every minute pays the hour his debt


so so quoth he these lets attend the time
like little frosts that sometime threat the spring
to add a more rejoicing to the prime
and give the sneaped birds more cause to sing
pain pays the income of each precious thing
huge rocks high winds strong pirates shelves and sands
the merchant fears ere rich at home he lands


now is he come unto the chamberdoor
that shuts him from the heaven of his thought
which with a yielding latch and with no more
hath barrd him from the blessed thing be sought
so from himself impiety hath wrought
that for his prey to pray he doth begin
as if the heavens should countenance his sin


but in the midst of his unfruitful prayer
having solicited th eternal power
that his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair
and they would stand auspicious to the hour
even there he starts quoth he i must deflower
the powers to whom i pray abhor this fact
how can they then assist me in the act


then love and fortune be my gods my guide
my will is backd with resolution
thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried
the blackest sin is cleard with absolution
against loves fire fears frost hath dissolution
the eye of heaven is out and misty night
covers the shame that follows sweet delight


this said his guilty hand pluckd up the latch
and with his knee the door he opens wide
the dove sleeps fast that this nightowl will catch
thus treason works ere traitors be espied
who sees the lurking serpent steps aside
but she sound sleeping fearing no such thing
lies at the mercy of his mortal sting


into the chamber wickedly he stalks
and gazeth on her yet unstained bed
the curtains being close about he walks
rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head
by their high treason is his heart misled
which gives the watchword to his hand full soon
to draw the cloud that hides the silver moon


look as the fair and fierypointed sun
rushing from forth a cloud bereaves our sight
even so the curtain drawn his eyes begun
to wink being blinded with a greater light
whether it is that she reflects so bright
that dazzleth them or else some shame supposed
but blind they are and keep themselves enclosed


o had they in that darksome prison died
then had they seen the period of their ill
then collatine again by lucrece side
in his clear bed might have reposed still
but they must ope this blessed league to kill
and holythoughted lucrece to their sight
must sell her joy her life her worlds delight


her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under
cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss
who therefore angry seems to part in sunder
swelling on either side to want his bliss
between whose hills her head entombed is
where like a virtuous monument she lies
to be admired of lewd unhallowd eyes


without the bed her other fair hand was
on the green coverlet whose perfect white
showd like an april daisy on the grass
with pearly sweat resembling dew of night
her eyes like marigolds had sheathed their light
and canopied in darkness sweetly lay
till they might open to adorn the day


her hair like golden threads playd with her breath
o modest wantons wanton modesty
showing lifes triumph in the map of death
and deaths dim look in lifes mortality
each in her sleep themselves so beautify
as if between them twain there were no strife
but that life lived in death and death in life


her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue
a pair of maiden worlds unconquered
save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew
and him by oath they truly honoured
these worlds in tarquin new ambition bred
who like a foul ursurper went about
from this fair throne to heave the owner out


what could he see but mightily he noted
what did he note but strongly he desired
what he beheld on that he firmly doted
and in his will his wilful eye he tired
with more than admiration he admired
her azure veins her alabaster skin
her coral lips her snowwhite dimpled chin


as the grim lion fawneth oer his prey
sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied
so oer this sleeping soul doth tarquin stay
his rage of lust by gazing qualified
slackd not suppressd for standing by her side
his eye which late this mutiny restrains
unto a greater uproar tempts his veins


and they like straggling slaves for pillage fighting
obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting
in bloody death and ravishment delighting
nor childrens tears nor mothers groans respecting
swell in their pride the onset still expecting
anon his beating heart alarum striking
gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking


his drumming heart cheers up his burning eye
his eye commends the leading to his hand
his hand as proud of such a dignity
smoking with pride marchd on to make his stand
on her bare breast the heart of all her land
whose ranks of blue veins as his hand did scale
left there round turrets destitute and pale


they mustering to the quiet cabinet
where their dear governess and lady lies
do tell her she is dreadfully beset
and fright her with confusion of their cries
she much amazed breaks ope her lockdup eyes
who peeping forth this tumult to behold
are by his flaming torch dimmd and controlld


imagine her as one in dead of night
from forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking
that thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite
whose grim aspect sets every joint ashaking
what terror or tis but she in worser taking
from sleep disturbed heedfully doth view
the sight which makes supposed terror true


wrappd and confounded in a thousand fears
like to a newkilld bird she trembling lies
she dares not look yet winking there appears
quickshifting antics ugly in her eyes
such shadows are the weak brains forgeries
who angry that the eyes fly from their lights
in darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights


his hand that yet remains upon her breast
rude ram to batter such an ivory wall
may feel her heartpoor citizendistressd
wounding itself to death rise up and fall
beating her bulk that his hand shakes withal
this moves in him more rage and lesser pity
to make the breach and enter this sweet city


first like a trumpet doth his tongue begin
to sound a parley to his heartless foe
who oer the white sheet peers her whiter chin
the reason of this rash alarm to know
which he by dumb demeanor seeks to show
but she with vehement prayers urgeth still
under what colour he commits this ill


thus he replies the colour in thy face
that even for anger makes the lily pale
and the red rose blush at her own disgrace
shall plead for me and tell my loving tale
under that colour am i come to scale
thy neverconquerd fort the fault is thine
for those thine eyes betray thee unto mine


thus i forestall thee if thou mean to chide
thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night
where thou with patience must my will abide
my will that marks thee for my earths delight
which i to conquer sought with all my might
but as reproof and reason beat it dead
by thy bright beauty was it newly bred


i see what crosses my attempt will bring
i know what thorns the growing rose defends
i think the honey guarded with a sting
all this beforehand counsel comprehends
but will is deaf and hears no heedful friends
only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty
and dotes on what he looks gainst law or duty


i have debated even in my soul
what wrong what shame what sorrow i shall breed
but nothing can affections course control
or stop the headlong fury of his speed
i know repentant tears ensue the deed
reproach disdain and deadly enmity
yet strive i to embrace mine infamy


this said he shakes aloft his roman blade
which like a falcon towering in the skies
coucheth the fowl below with his wings shade
whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies
so under his insulting falchion lies
harmless lucretia marking what he tells
with trembling fear as fowl hear falcons bells


lucrece quoth hethis night i must enjoy thee
if thou deny then force must work my way
for in thy bed i purpose to destroy thee
that done some worthless slave of thine ill slay
to kill thine honour with thy lifes decay
and in thy dead arms do i mean to place him
swearing i slew him seeing thee embrace him


so thy surviving husband shall remain
the scornful mark of every open eye
thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain
thy issue blurrd with nameless bastardy
and thou the author of their obloquy
shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes
and sung by children in succeeding times


but if thou yield i rest thy secret friend
the fault unknown is as a thought unacted
a little harm done to a great good end
for lawful policy remains enacted
the poisonous simple sometimes is compacted
in a pure compound being so applied
his venom in effect is purified


then for thy husband and thy childrens sake
tender my suit bequeath not to their lot
the shame that from them no device can take
the blemish that will never be forgot
worse than a slavish wipe or birthhours blot
for marks descried in mens nativity
are natures faults not their own infamy


here with a cockatrice deadkilling eye
he rouseth up himself and makes a pause
while she the picture of pure piety
like a white hind under the gripes sharp claws
pleads in a wilderness where are no laws
to the rough beast that knows no gentle right
nor aught obeys but his foul appetite


but when a blackfaced cloud the world doth threat
in his dim mist the aspiring mountains hiding
from earths dark womb some gentle gust doth get
which blows these pitchy vapours from their bidding
hindering their present fall by this dividing
so his unhallowd haste her words delays
and moody pluto winks while orpheus plays


yet foul nightwaking cat he doth but dally
while in his holdfast foot the weak mouse panteth
her sad behavior feeds his vulture folly
a swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth
his ear her prayers admits but his heart granteth
no penetrable entrance to her plaining
tears harden lust though marble wear with raining


her pitypleading eyes are sadly fixd
in the remorseless wrinkles of his face
her modest eloquence with sighs is mixd
which to her oratory adds more grace
she puts the period often from his place
and midst the sentence so her accent breaks
that twice she doth begin ere once she speaks


she conjures him by high almighty jove
by knighthood gentry and sweet friendships oath
by her untimely tears her husbands love
by holy human law and common troth
by heaven and earth and all the power of both
that to his borrowd bed he make retire
and stoop to honour not to foul desire


quoth she reward not hospitality
with such black payment as thou hast pretended
mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee
mar not the thing that cannot be amended
end thy ill aim before thy shoot be ended
he is no woodman that doth bend his bow
to strike a poor unseasonable doe


my husband is thy friend for his sake spare me
thyself art mighty for thine own sake leave me
myself a weakling do not then ensnare me
thou lookst not like deceit do not deceive me
my sighs like whirlwinds labour hence to heave thee
if ever man were moved with woman moans
be moved with my tears my sighs my groans


all which together like a troubled ocean
beat at thy rocky and wreckthreatening heart
to soften it with their continual motion
for stones dissolved to water do convert
o if no harder than a stone thou art
melt at my tears and be compassionate
soft pity enters at an iron gate


in tarquins likeness i did entertain thee
hast thou put on his shape to do him shame
to all the host of heaven i complain me
thou wrongst his honour woundst his princely name
thou art not what thou seemst and if the same
thou seemst not what thou art a god a king
for kings like gods should govern everything


how will thy shame be seeded in thine age
when thus thy vices bud before thy spring
if in thy hope thou darest do such outrage
what darest thou not when once thou art a king
o be rememberd no outrageous thing
from vassal actors can be wiped away
then kings misdeeds cannot be hid in clay


this deed will make thee only loved for fear
but happy monarchs still are feard for love
with foul offenders thou perforce must bear
when they in thee the like offences prove
if but for fear of this thy will remove
for princes are the glass the school the book
where subjects eyes do learn do read do look


and wilt thou be the school where lust shall learn
must he in thee read lectures of such shame
wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern
authority for sin warrant for blame
to privilege dishonour in thy name
thou blackst reproach against longliving laud
and makest fair reputation but a bawd


hast thou command by him that gave it thee
from a pure heart command thy rebel will
draw not thy sword to guard iniquity
for it was lent thee all that brood to kill
thy princely office how canst thou fulfil
when patternd by thy fault foul sin may say
he learnd to sin and thou didst teach the way


think but how vile a spectacle it were
to view thy present trespass in another
mens faults do seldom to themselves appear
their own transgressions partially they smother
this guilt would seem deathworthy in thy brother
o how are they wrappd in with infamies
that from their own misdeeds askance their eyes


to thee to thee my heavedup hands appeal
not to seducing lust thy rash relier
i sue for exiled majestys repeal
let him return and flattering thoughts retire
his true respect will prison false desire
and wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne
that thou shalt see thy state and pity mine


have done quoth he my uncontrolled tide
turns not but swells the higher by this let
small lights are soon blown out huge fires abide
and with the wind in greater fury fret
the petty streams that pay a daily debt
to their salt sovereign with their fresh falls haste
add to his flow but alter not his taste


thou art quoth she a sea a sovereign king
and lo there falls into thy boundless flood
black lust dishonour shame misgoverning
who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood
if all these pretty ills shall change thy good
thy sea within a puddles womb is hearsed
and not the puddle in thy sea dispersed


so shall these slaves be king and thou their slave
thou nobly base they basely dignified
thou their fair life and they thy fouler grave
thou loathed in their shame they in thy pride
the lesser thing should not the greater hide
the cedar stoops not to the base shrubs foot
but low shrubs wither at the cedars root


so let thy thoughts low vassals to thy state
no more quoth he by heaven i will not hear thee
yield to my love if not enforced hate
instead of loves coy touch shall rudely tear thee
that done despitefully i mean to bear thee
unto the base bed of some rascal groom
to be thy partner in this shameful doom


this said he sets his foot upon the light
for light and lust are deadly enemies
shame folded up in blind concealing night
when most unseen then most doth tyrannize
the wolf hath seized his prey the poor lamb cries
till with her own white fleece her voice controlld
entombs her outcry in her lips sweet fold


for with the nightly linen that she wears
he pens her piteous clamours in her head
cooling his hot face in the chastest tears
that ever modest eyes with sorrow shed
o that prone lust should stain so pure a bed
the spots whereof could weeping purify
her tears should drop on them perpetually


but she hath lost a dearer thing than life
and he hath won what he would lose again
this forced league doth force a further strife
this momentary joy breeds months of pain
this hot desire converts to cold disdain
pure chastity is rifled of her store
and lust the thief far poorer than before


look as the fullfed hound or gorged hawk
unapt for tender smell or speedy flight
make slow pursuit or altogether balk
the prey wherein by nature they delight
so surfeittaking tarquin fares this night
his taste delicious in digestion souring
devours his will that lived by foul devouring


o deeper sin than bottomless conceit
can comprehend in still imagination
drunken desire must vomit his receipt
ere he can see his own abomination
while lust is in his pride no exclamation
can curb his heat or rein his rash desire
till like a jade selfwill himself doth tire


and then with lank and lean discolourd cheek
with heavy eye knit brow and strengthless pace
feeble desire all recreant poor and meek
like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case
the flesh being proud desire doth fight with grace
for there it revels and when that decays
the guilty rebel for remission prays


so fares it with this faultful lord of rome
who this accomplishment so hotly chased
for now against himself he sounds this doom
that through the length of times he stands disgraced
besides his souls fair temple is defaced
to whose weak ruins muster troops of cares
to ask the spotted princess how she fares


she says her subjects with foul insurrection
have batterd down her consecrated wall
and by their mortal fault brought in subjection
her immortality and made her thrall
to living death and pain perpetual
which in her prescience she controlled still
but her foresight could not forestall their will


even in this thought through the dark night he stealeth
a captive victor that hath lost in gain
bearing away the wound that nothing healeth
the scar that will despite of cure remain
leaving his spoil perplexd in greater pain
she bears the load of lust he left behind
and he the burden of a guilty mind


he like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence
she like a wearied lamb lies panting there
he scowls and hates himself for his offence
she desperate with her nails her flesh doth tear
he faintly flies sneaking with guilty fear
she stays exclaiming on the direful night
he runs and chides his vanishd loathed delight


he thence departs a heavy convertite
she there remains a hopeless castaway
he in his speed looks for the morning light
she prays she never may behold the day
for day quoth she nights scapes doth open lay
and my true eyes have never practised how
to cloak offences with a cunning brow


they think not but that every eye can see
the same disgrace which they themselves behold
and therefore would they still in darkness be
to have their unseen sin remain untold
for they their guilt with weeping will unfold
and grave like water that doth eat in steel
upon my cheeks what helpless shame i feel


here she exclaims against repose and rest
and bids her eyes hereafter still be blind
she wakes her heart by beating on her breast
and bids it leap from thence where it may find
some purer chest to close so pure a mind
frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite
against the unseen secrecy of night


o comfortkilling night image of hell
dim register and notary of shame
black stage for tragedies and murders fell
vast sinconcealing chaos nurse of blame
blind muffled bawd dark harbour for defame
grim cave of death whispering conspirator
with closetongued treason and the ravisher


o hateful vaporous and foggy night
since thou art guilty of my cureless crime
muster thy mists to meet the eastern light
make war against proportiond course of time
or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
his wonted height yet ere he go to bed
knit poisonous clouds about his golden head


with rotten damps ravish the morning air
let their exhaled unwholesome breaths make sick
the life of purity the supreme fair
ere he arrive his weary noontide prick
and let thy misty vapours march so thick
that in their smoky ranks his smotherd light
may set at noon and make perpetual night


were tarquin night as he is but nights child
the silvershining queen he would distain
her twinkling handmaids too by him defiled
through nights black bosom should not peep again
so should i have copartners in my pain
and fellowship in woe doth woe assuage
as palmers chat makes short their pilgrimage


where now i have no one to blush with me
to cross their arms and hang their heads with mine
to mask their brows and hide their infamy
but i alone alone must sit and pine
seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine
mingling my talk with tears my grief with groans
poor wasting monuments of lasting moans


o night thou furnace of foulreeking smoke
let not the jealous day behold that face
which underneath thy black allhiding cloak
immodestly lies martyrd with disgrace
keep still possession of thy gloomy place
that all the faults which in thy reign are made
may likewise be sepulchred in thy shade


make me not object to the telltale day
the light will show characterd in my brow
the story of sweet chastitys decay
the impious breach of holy wedlock vow
yea the illiterate that know not how
to cipher what is writ in learned books
will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks


the nurse to still her child will tell my story
and fright her crying babe with tarquins name
the orator to deck his oratory
will couple my reproach to tarquins shame
feastfinding minstrels tuning my defame
will tie the hearers to attend each line
how tarquin wronged me i collatine


let my good name that senseless reputation
for collatines dear love be kept unspotted
if that be made a theme for disputation
the branches of another root are rotted
and undeserved reproach to him allotted
that is as clear from this attaint of mine
as i ere this was pure to collatine


o unseen shame invisible disgrace
o unfelt sore crestwounding private scar
reproach is stampd in collatinus face
and tarquins eye may read the mot afar
how he in peace is wounded not in war
alas how many bear such shameful blows
which not themselves but he that gives them knows


if collatine thine honour lay in me
from me by strong assault it is bereft
my honour lost and i a dronelike bee
have no perfection of my summer left
but robbd and ransackd by injurious theft
in thy weak hive a wandering wasp hath crept
and suckd the honey which thy chaste bee kept


yet am i guilty of thy honours wrack
yet for thy honour did i entertain him
coming from thee i could not put him back
for it had been dishonour to disdain him
besides of weariness he did complain him
and talkd of virtue o unlookdfor evil
when virtue is profaned in such a devil


why should the worm intrude the maiden bud
or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows nests
or toads infect fair founts with venom mud
or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts
or kings be breakers of their own behests
but no perfection is so absolute
that some impurity doth not pollute


the aged man that coffersup his gold
is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits
and scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold
but like stillpining tantalus he sits
and useless barns the harvest of his wits
having no other pleasure of his gain
but torment that it cannot cure his pain


so then he hath it when he cannot use it
and leaves it to be masterd by his young
who in their pride do presently abuse it
their father was too weak and they too strong
to hold their cursedblessed fortune long
the sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
even in the moment that we call them ours


unruly blasts wait on the tender spring
unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers
the adder hisses where the sweet birds sing
what virtue breeds iniquity devours
we have no good that we can say is ours
but illannexed opportunity
or kills his life or else his quality


o opportunity thy guilt is great
tis thou that executest the traitors treason
thou setst the wolf where he the lamb may get
whoever plots the sin thou pointst the season
tis thou that spurnst at right at law at reason
and in thy shady cell where none may spy him
sits sin to seize the souls that wander by him


thou makest the vestal violate her oath
thou blowst the fire when temperance is thawd
thou smotherst honesty thou murderst troth
thou foul abettor thou notorious bawd
thou plantest scandal and displacest laud
thou ravisher thou traitor thou false thief
thy honey turns to gall thy joy to grief


thy secret pleasure turns to open shame
thy private feasting to a public fast
thy smoothing titles to a ragged name
thy sugard tongue to bitter wormwood taste
thy violent vanities can never last
how comes it then vile opportunity
being so bad such numbers seek for thee


when wilt thou be the humble suppliants friend
and bring him where his suit may be obtaind
when wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end
or free that soul which wretchedness hath chaind
give physic to the sick ease to the paind
the poor lame blind halt creep cry out for thee
but they neer meet with opportunity


the patient dies while the physician sleeps
the orphan pines while the oppressor feeds
justice is feasting while the widow weeps
advice is sporting while infection breeds
thou grantst no time for charitable deeds
wrath envy treason rape and murders rages
thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages


when truth and virtue have to do with thee
a thousand crosses keep them from thy aid
they buy thy help but sin neer gives a fee
he gratis comes and thou art well appaid
as well to hear as grant what he hath said
my collatine would else have come to me
when tarquin did but he was stayd by thee


guilty thou art of murder and of theft
guilty of perjury and subornation
guilty of treason forgery and shift
guilty of incest that abomination
an accessary by thine inclination
to all sins past and all that are to come
from the creation to the general doom


misshapen time copesmate of ugly night
swift subtle post carrier of grisly care
eater of youth false slave to false delight
base watch of woes sins packhorse virtues snare
thou nursest all and murderst all that are
o hear me then injurious shifting time
be guilty of my death since of my crime


why hath thy servant opportunity
betrayd the hours thou gavest me to repose
cancelld my fortunes and enchained me
to endless date of neverending woes
times office is to fine the hate of foes
to eat up errors by opinion bred
not spend the dowry of a lawful bed


times glory is to calm contending kings
to unmask falsehood and bring truth to light
to stamp the seal of time in aged things
to wake the morn and sentinel the night
to wrong the wronger till he render right
to ruinate proud buildings with thy hours
and smear with dust their glittering golden towers


to fill with wormholes stately monuments
to feed oblivion with decay of things
to blot old books and alter their contents
to pluck the quills from ancient ravens wings
to dry the old oaks sap and cherish springs
to spoil antiquities of hammerd steel
and turn the giddy round of fortunes wheel


to show the beldam daughters of her daughter
to make the child a man the man a child
to slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter
to tame the unicorn and lion wild
to mock the subtle in themselves beguiled
to cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops
and waste huge stones with little water drops


why workst thou mischief in thy pilgrimage
unless thou couldst return to make amends
one poor retiring minute in an age
would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends
lending him wit that to bad debtors lends
o this dread night wouldst thou one hour come back
i could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack


thou ceaseless lackey to eternity
with some mischance cross tarquin in his flight
devise extremes beyond extremity
to make him curse this cursed crimeful night
let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright
and the dire thought of his committed evil
shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil


disturb his hours of rest with restless trances
afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans
let there bechance him pitiful mischances
to make him moan but pity not his moans
stone him with hardend hearts harder than stones
and let mild women to him lose their mildness
wilder to him than tigers in their wildness


let him have time to tear his curled hair
let him have time against himself to rave
let him have time of times help to despair
let him have time to live a loathed slave
let him have time a beggars orts to crave
and time to see one that by alms doth live
disdain to him disdained scraps to give


let him have time to see his friends his foes
and merry fools to mock at him resort
let him have time to mark how slow time goes
in time of sorrow and how swift and short
his time of folly and his time of sport
and ever let his unrecalling crime
have time to wail th abusing of his time


o time thou tutor both to good and bad
teach me to curse him that thou taughtst this ill
at his own shadow let the thief run mad
himself himself seek every hour to kill
such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill
for who so base would such an office have
as slanderous deathsman to so base a slave


the baser is he coming from a king
to shame his hope with deeds degenerate
the mightier man the mightier is the thing
that makes him honourd or begets him hate
for greatest scandal waits on greatest state
the moon being clouded presently is missd
but little stars may hide them when they list


the crow may bathe his coalblack wings in mire
and unperceived fly with the filth away
but if the like the snowwhite swan desire
the stain upon his silver down will stay
poor grooms are sightless night kings glorious day
gnats are unnoted wheresoeer they fly
but eagles gazed upon with every eye


out idle words servants to shallow fools
unprofitable sounds weak arbitrators
busy yourselves in skillcontending schools
debate where leisure serves with dull debaters
to trembling clients be you mediators
for me i force not argument a straw
since that my case is past the help of law


in vain i rail at opportunity
at time at tarquin and uncheerful night
in vain i cavil with mine infamy
in vain i spurn at my confirmd despite
this helpless smoke of words doth me no right
the remedy indeed to do me good
is to let forth my fouldefiled blood


poor hand why quiverst thou at this decree
honour thyself to rid me of this shame
for if i die my honour lives in thee
but if i live thou livest in my defame
since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame
and wast afeard to scratch her wicked foe
kill both thyself and her for yielding so


this said from her betumbled couch she starteth
to find some desperate instrument of death
but this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth
to make more vent for passage of her breath
which thronging through her lips so vanisheth
as smoke from aetna that in air consumes
or that which from discharged cannon fumes


in vain quoth she i live and seek in vain
some happy mean to end a hapless life
i feard by tarquins falchion to be slain
yet for the selfsame purpose seek a knife
but when i feard i was a loyal wife
so am i now o no that cannot be
of that true type hath tarquin rifled me


o that is gone for which i sought to live
and therefore now i need not fear to die
to clear this spot by death at least i give
a badge of fame to slanders livery
a dying life to living infamy
poor helpless help the treasure stoln away
to burn the guiltless casket where it lay


well well dear collatine thou shalt not know
the stained taste of violated troth
i will not wrong thy true affection so
to flatter thee with an infringed oath
this bastard graff shall never come to growth
he shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
that thou art doting father of his fruit


nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought
nor laugh with his companions at thy state
but thou shalt know thy interest was not bought
basely with gold but stoln from forth thy gate
for me i am the mistress of my fate
and with my trespass never will dispense
till life to death acquit my forced offence


i will not poison thee with my attaint
nor fold my fault in cleanlycoind excuses
my sable ground of sin i will not paint
to hide the truth of this false nights abuses
my tongue shall utter all mine eyes like sluices
as from a mountainspring that feeds a dale
shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale


by this lamenting philomel had ended
the welltuned warble of her nightly sorrow
and solemn night with slow sad gait descended
to ugly hell when lo the blushing morrow
lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow
but cloudy lucrece shames herself to see
and therefore still in night would cloisterd be


revealing day through every cranny spies
and seems to point her out where she sits weeping
to whom she sobbing speaks o eye of eyes
why pryst thou through my window leave thy peeping
mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping
brand not my forehead with thy piercing light
for day hath nought to do whats done by night


thus cavils she with every thing she sees
true grief is fond and testy as a child
who wayward once his mood with nought agrees
old woes not infant sorrows bear them mild
continuance tames the one the other wild
like an unpractised swimmer plunging still
with too much labour drowns for want of skill


so she deepdrenched in a sea of care
holds disputation with each thing she views
and to herself all sorrow doth compare
no object but her passions strength renews
and as one shifts another straight ensues
sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words
sometime tis mad and too much talk affords


the little birds that tune their mornings joy
make her moans mad with their sweet melody
for mirth doth search the bottom of annoy
sad souls are slain in merry company
grief best is pleased with griefs society
true sorrow then is feelingly sufficed
when with like semblance it is sympathized


tis double death to drown in ken of shore
he ten times pines that pines beholding food
to see the salve doth make the wound ache more
great grief grieves most at that would do it good
deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood
who being stoppd the bounding banks oerflows
grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows


you mockingbirds quoth she your tunes entomb
within your hollowswelling featherd breasts
and in my hearing be you mute and dumb
my restless discord loves no stops nor rests
a woeful hostess brooks not merry guests
relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears
distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears


come philomel that singst of ravishment
make thy sad grove in my dishevelld hair
as the dank earth weeps at thy languishment
so i at each sad strain will strain a tear
and with deep groans the diapason bear
for burdenwise ill hum on tarquin still
while thou on tereus descantst better skill


and whiles against a thorn thou bearst thy part
to keep thy sharp woes waking wretched i
to imitate thee well against my heart
will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye
who if it wink shall thereon fall and die
these means as frets upon an instrument
shall tune our heartstrings to true languishment


and for poor bird thou singst not in the day
as shaming any eye should thee behold
some dark deep desert seated from the way
that knows not parching heat nor freezing cold
will we find out and there we will unfold
to creatures stern sad tunes to change their kinds
since men prove beasts let beasts bear gentle minds


as the poor frighted deer that stands at gaze
wildly determining which way to fly
or one encompassd with a winding maze
that cannot tread the way out readily
so with herself is she in mutiny
to live or die which of the twain were better
when life is shamed and death reproachs debtor


to kill myself quoth she alack what were it
but with my body my poor souls pollution
they that lose half with greater patience bear it
than they whose whole is swallowd in confusion
that mother tries a merciless conclusion
who having two sweet babes when death takes one
will slay the other and be nurse to none


my body or my soul which was the dearer
when the one pure the other made divine
whose love of either to myself was nearer
when both were kept for heaven and collatine
ay me the bark peeld from the lofty pine
his leaves will wither and his sap decay
so must my soul her bark being peeld away


her house is sackd her quiet interrupted
her mansion batterd by the enemy
her sacred temple spotted spoild corrupted
grossly engirt with daring infamy
then let it not be calld impiety
if in this blemishd fort i make some hole
through which i may convey this troubled soul


yet die i will not till my collatine
have heard the cause of my untimely death
that he may vow in that sad hour of mine
revenge on him that made me stop my breath
my stained blood to tarquin ill bequeath
which by him tainted shall for him be spent
and as his due writ in my testament


my honour ill bequeath unto the knife
that wounds my body so dishonoured
tis honour to deprive dishonourd life
the one will live the other being dead
so of shames ashes shall my fame be bred
for in my death i murder shameful scorn
my shame so dead mine honour is newborn


dear lord of that dear jewel i have lost
what legacy shall i bequeath to thee
my resolution love shall be thy boast
by whose example thou revenged mayest be
how tarquin must be used read it in me
myself thy friend will kill myself thy foe
and for my sake serve thou false tarquin so


this brief abridgement of my will i make
my soul and body to the skies and ground
my resolution husband do thou take
mine honour be the knifes that makes my wound
my shame be his that did my fame confound
and all my fame that lives disbursed be
to those that live and think no shame of me


thou collatine shalt oversee this will
how was i overseen that thou shalt see it
my blood shall wash the slander of mine ill
my lifes foul deed my lifes fair end shall free it
faint not faint heart but stoutly say so be it
yield to my hand my hand shall conquer thee
thou dead both die and both shall victors be


this plot of death when sadly she had laid
and wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes
with untuned tongue she hoarsely calls her maid
whose swift obedience to her mistress hies
for fleetwingd duty with thoughts feathers flies
poor lucrece cheeks unto her maid seem so
as winter meads when sun doth melt their snow


her mistress she doth give demure goodmorrow
with softslow tongue true mark of modesty
and sorts a sad look to her ladys sorrow
for why her face wore sorrows livery
but durst not ask of her audaciously
why her two suns were cloudeclipsed so
nor why her fair cheeks overwashd with woe


but as the earth doth weep the sun being set
each flower moistend like a melting eye
even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet
her circled eyne enforced by sympathy
of those fair suns set in her mistress sky
who in a saltwaved ocean quench their light
which makes the maid weep like the dewy night


a pretty while these pretty creatures stand
like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling
one justly weeps the other takes in hand
no cause but company of her drops spilling
their gentle sex to weep are often willing
grieving themselves to guess at others smarts
and then they drown their eyes or break their hearts


for men have marble women waxen minds
and therefore are they formd as marble will
the weak oppressd the impression of strange kinds
is formd in them by force by fraud or skill
then call them not the authors of their ill
no more than wax shall be accounted evil
wherein is stampd the semblance of a devil


their smoothness like a goodly champaign plain
lays open all the little worms that creep
in men as in a roughgrown grove remain
cavekeeping evils that obscurely sleep
through crystal walls each little mote will peep
though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks
poor womens faces are their own faults books


no man inveigh against the witherd flower
but chide rough winter that the flower hath killd
not that devourd but that which doth devour
is worthy blame o let it not be hild
poor womens faults that they are so fulfilld
with mens abuses those proud lords to blame
make weakmade women tenants to their shame


the precedent whereof in lucrece view
assaild by night with circumstances strong
of present death and shame that might ensue
by that her death to do her husband wrong
such danger to resistance did belong
that dying fear through all her body spread
and who cannot abuse a body dead


by this mild patience bid fair lucrece speak
to the poor counterfeit of her complaining
my girl quoth she on what occasion break
those tears from thee that down thy cheeks are raining
if thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining
know gentle wench it small avails my mood
if tears could help mine own would do me good


but tell me girl when wentand there she stayd
till after a deep groantarquin from hence
madam ere i was up replied the maid
the more to blame my sluggard negligence
yet with the fault i thus far can dispense
myself was stirring ere the break of day
and ere i rose was tarquin gone away


but lady if your maid may be so bold
she would request to know your heaviness
o peace quoth lucrece if it should be told
the repetition cannot make it less
for more it is than i can well express
and that deep torture may be calld a hell
when more is felt than one hath power to tell


go get me hither paper ink and pen
yet save that labour for i have them here
what should i say one of my husbands men
bid thou be ready by and by to bear
a letter to my lord my love my dear
bid him with speed prepare to carry it
the cause craves haste and it will soon be writ


her maid is gone and she prepares to write
first hovering oer the paper with her quill
conceit and grief an eager combat fight
what wit sets down is blotted straight with will
this is too curiousgood this blunt and ill
much like a press of people at a door
throng her inventions which shall go before


at last she thus begins thou worthy lord
of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee
health to thy person next vouchsafe t afford
if ever love thy lucrece thou wilt see
some present speed to come and visit me
so i commend me from our house in grief
my woes are tedious though my words are brief


here folds she up the tenor of her woe
her certain sorrow writ uncertainly
by this short schedule collatine may know
her grief but not her griefs true quality
she dares not thereof make discovery
lest he should hold it her own gross abuse
ere she with blood had staind her staind excuse


besides the life and feeling of her passion
she hoards to spend when he is by to hear her
when sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion
of her disgrace the better so to clear her
from that suspicion which the world might bear her
to shun this blot she would not blot the letter
with words till action might become them better


to see sad sights moves more than hear them told
for then eye interprets to the ear
the heavy motion that it doth behold
when every part a part of woe doth bear
tis but a part of sorrow that we hear
deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords
and sorrow ebbs being blown with wind of words


her letter now is seald and on it writ
at ardea to my lord with more than haste
the post attends and she delivers it
charging the sourfaced groom to hie as fast
as lagging fowls before the northern blast
speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems
extremity still urgeth such extremes


the homely villain courtsies to her low
and blushing on her with a steadfast eye
receives the scroll without or yea or no
and forth with bashful innocence doth hie
but they whose guilt within their bosoms lie
imagine every eye beholds their blame
for lucrece thought he blushd to her see shame


when silly groom god wot it was defect
of spirit life and bold audacity
such harmless creatures have a true respect
to talk in deeds while others saucily
promise more speed but do it leisurely
even so this pattern of the wornout age
pawnd honest looks but laid no words to gage


his kindled duty kindled her mistrust
that two red fires in both their faces blazed
she thought he blushd as knowing tarquins lust
and blushing with him wistly on him gazed
her earnest eye did make him more amazed
the more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish
the more she thought he spied in her some blemish


but long she thinks till he return again
and yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone
the weary time she cannot entertain
for now tis stale to sigh to weep and groan
so woe hath wearied woe moan tired moan
that she her plaints a little while doth stay
pausing for means to mourn some newer way


at last she calls to mind where hangs a piece
of skilful painting made for priams troy
before the which is drawn the power of greece
for helens rape the city to destroy
threatening cloudkissing ilion with annoy
which the conceited painter drew so proud
as heaven it seemd to kiss the turrets bowd


a thousand lamentable objects there
in scorn of nature art gave lifeless life
many a dry drop seemd a weeping tear
shed for the slaughterd husband by the wife
the red blood reekd to show the painters strife
and dying eyes gleamd forth their ashy lights
like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights


there might you see the labouring pioner
begrimed with sweat and smeared all with dust
and from the towers of troy there would appear
the very eyes of men through loopholes thrust
gazing upon the greeks with little lust
such sweet observance in this work was had
that one might see those faroff eyes look sad


in great commanders grace and majesty
you might behold triumphing in their faces
in youth quick bearing and dexterity
pale cowards marching on with trembling paces
which heartless peasants did so well resemble
that one would swear he saw them quake and tremble


in ajax and ulysses o what art
of physiognomy might one behold
the face of either cipherd eithers heart
their face their manners most expressly told
in ajax eyes blunt rage and rigor rolld
but the mild glance that sly ulysses lent
showd deep regard and smiling government


there pleading might you see grave nestor stand
as twere encouraging the greeks to fight
making such sober action with his hand
that it beguiled attention charmd the sight
in speech it seemd his beard all silver white
waggd up and down and from his lips did fly
thin winding breath which purld up to the sky


about him were a press of gaping faces
which seemd to swallow up his sound advice
all jointly listening but with several graces
as if some mermaid did their ears entice
some high some low the painter was so nice
the scalps of many almost hid behind
to jump up higher seemd to mock the mind


here one mans hand leand on anothers head
his nose being shadowd by his neighbours ear
here one being throngd bears back all bolln and red
another smotherd seems to pelt and swear
and in their rage such signs of rage they bear
as but for loss of nestors golden words
it seemd they would debate with angry swords


for much imaginary work was there
conceit deceitful so compact so kind
that for achilles image stood his spear
griped in an armed hand himself behind
was left unseen save to the eye of mind
a hand a foot a face a leg a head
stood for the whole to be imagined


and from the walls of strongbesieged troy
when their brave hope bold hector marchd to field
stood many trojan mothers sharing joy
to see their youthful sons bright weapons wield
and to their hope they such odd action yield
that through their light joy seemed to appear
like bright things staind a kind of heavy fear


and from the strand of dardan where they fought
to simois reedy banks the red blood ran
whose waves to imitate the battle sought
with swelling ridges and their ranks began
to break upon the galled shore and than
retire again till meeting greater ranks
they join and shoot their foam at simois banks


to this wellpainted piece is lucrece come
to find a face where all distress is stelld
many she sees where cares have carved some
but none where all distress and dolour dwelld
till she despairing hecuba beheld
staring on priams wounds with her old eyes
which bleeding under pyrrhus proud foot lies


in her the painter had anatomized
times ruin beautys wreck and grim cares reign
her cheeks with chaps and wrinkles were disguised
of what she was no semblance did remain
her blue blood changed to black in every vein
wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed
showd life imprisond in a body dead


on this sad shadow lucrece spends her eyes
and shapes her sorrow to the beldams woes
who nothing wants to answer her but cries
and bitter words to ban her cruel foes
the painter was no god to lend her those
and therefore lucrece swears he did her wrong
to give her so much grief and not a tongue


poor instrument quoth shewithout a sound
ill tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue
and drop sweet balm in priams painted wound
and rail on pyrrhus that hath done him wrong
and with my tears quench troy that burns so long
and with my knife scratch out the angry eyes
of all the greeks that are thine enemies


show me the strumpet that began this stir
that with my nails her beauty i may tear
thy heat of lust fond paris did incur
this load of wrath that burning troy doth bear
thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here
and here in troy for trespass of thine eye
the sire the son the dame and daughter die


why should the private pleasure of some one
become the public plague of many moe
let sin alone committed light alone
upon his head that hath transgressed so
let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe
for ones offence why should so many fall
to plague a private sin in general


lo here weeps hecuba here priam dies
here manly hector faints here troilus swounds
here friend by friend in bloody channel lies
and friend to friend gives unadvised wounds
and one mans lust these many lives confounds
had doting priam chequed his sons desire
troy had been bright with fame and not with fire


here feelingly she weeps troys painted woes
for sorrow like a heavyhanging bell
once set on ringing with his own weight goes
then little strength rings out the doleful knell
so lucrece set awork sad tales doth tell
to pencilld pensiveness and colourd sorrow
she lends them words and she their looks doth borrow


she throws her eyes about the painting round
and whom she finds forlorn she doth lament
at last she sees a wretched image bound
that piteous looks to phrygian shepherds lent
his face though full of cares yet showd content
onward to troy with the blunt swains he goes
so mild that patience seemd to scorn his woes


in him the painter labourd with his skill
to hide deceit and give the harmless show
an humble gait calm looks eyes wailing still
a brow unbent that seemd to welcome woe
cheeks neither red nor pale but mingled so
that blushing red no guilty instance gave
nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have


but like a constant and confirmed devil
he entertaind a show so seeming just
and therein so ensconced his secret evil
that jealousy itself could not mistrust
falsecreeping craft and perjury should thrust
into so bright a day such blackfaced storms
or blot with hellborn sin such saintlike forms


the wellskilld workman this mild image drew
for perjured sinon whose enchanting story
the credulous old priam after slew
whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory
of richbuilt ilion that the skies were sorry
and little stars shot from their fixed places
when their glass fell wherein they viewd their faces


this picture she advisedly perused
and chid the painter for his wondrous skill
saying some shape in sinons was abused
so fair a form lodged not a mind so ill
and still on him she gazed and gazing still
such signs of truth in his plain face she spied
that she concludes the picture was belied


it cannot be quoth shethat so much guile
she would have said can lurk in such a look
but tarquins shape came in her mind the while
and from her tongue can lurk from cannot took
it cannot be she in that sense forsook
and turnd it thus it cannot be i find
but such a face should bear a wicked mind


for even as subtle sinon here is painted
so sobersad so weary and so mild
as if with grief or travail he had fainted
to me came tarquin armed so beguiled
with outward honesty but yet defiled
with inward vice as priam him did cherish
so did i tarquin so my troy did perish


look look how listening priam wets his eyes
to see those borrowd tears that sinon sheds
priam why art thou old and yet not wise
for every tear he falls a trojan bleeds
his eye drops fire no water thence proceeds
those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity
are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city


such devils steal effects from lightless hell
for sinon in his fire doth quake with cold
and in that cold hotburning fire doth dwell
these contraries such unity do hold
only to flatter fools and make them bold
so priams trust false sinons tears doth flatter
that he finds means to burn his troy with water


here all enraged such passion her assails
that patience is quite beaten from her breast
she tears the senseless sinon with her nails
comparing him to that unhappy guest
whose deed hath made herself herself detest
at last she smilingly with this gives oer
fool fool quoth she his wounds will not be sore


thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow
and time doth weary time with her complaining
she looks for night and then she longs for morrow
and both she thinks too long with her remaining
short time seems long in sorrows sharp sustaining
though woe be heavy yet it seldom sleeps
and they that watch see time how slow it creeps


which all this time hath overslippd her thought
that she with painted images hath spent
being from the feeling of her own grief brought
by deep surmise of others detriment
losing her woes in shows of discontent
it easeth some though none it ever cured
to think their dolour others have endured


but now the mindful messenger come back
brings home his lord and other company
who finds his lucrece clad in mourning black
and round about her tearstained eye
blue circles streamd like rainbows in the sky
these watergalls in her dim element
foretell new storms to those already spent


which when her sadbeholding husband saw
amazedly in her sad face he stares
her eyes though sod in tears lookd red and raw
her lively colour killd with deadly cares
he hath no power to ask her how she fares
both stood like old acquaintance in a trance
met far from home wondering each others chance


at last he takes her by the bloodless hand
and thus begins what uncouth ill event
hath thee befalln that thou dost trembling stand
sweet love what spite hath thy fair colour spent
why art thou thus attired in discontent
unmask dear dear this moody heaviness
and tell thy grief that we may give redress


three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire
ere once she can discharge one word of woe
at length addressd to answer his desire
she modestly prepares to let them know
her honour is taen prisoner by the foe
while collatine and his consorted lords
with sad attention long to hear her words


and now this pale swan in her watery nest
begins the sad dirge of her certain ending
few words quoth she shall fit the trespass best
where no excuse can give the fault amending
in me moe woes than words are now depending
and my laments would be drawn out too long
to tell them all with one poor tired tongue


then be this all the task it hath to say
dear husband in the interest of thy bed
a stranger came and on that pillow lay
where thou was wont to rest thy weary head
and what wrong else may be imagined
by foul enforcement might be done to me
from that alas thy lucrece is not free


for in the dreadful dead of dark midnight
with shining falchion in my chamber came
a creeping creature with a flaming light
and softly cried awake thou roman dame
and entertain my love else lasting shame
on thee and thine this night i will inflict
if thou my loves desire do contradict


for some hardfavourd groom of thine quoth he
unless thou yoke thy liking to my will
ill murder straight and then ill slaughter thee
and swear i found you where you did fulfil
the loathsome act of lust and so did kill
the lechers in their deed this act will be
my fame and thy perpetual infamy


with this i did begin to start and cry
and then against my heart he sets his sword
swearing unless i took all patiently
i should not live to speak another word
so should my shame still rest upon record
and never be forgot in mighty rome
th adulterate death of lucrece and her groom


mine enemy was strong my poor self weak
and far the weaker with so strong a fear
my bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak
no rightful plea might plead for justice there
his scarlet lust came evidence to swear
that my poor beauty had purloind his eyes
and when the judge is robbd the prisoner dies


o teach me how to make mine own excuse
or at the least this refuge let me find
though my gross blood be staind with this abuse
immaculate and spotless is my mind
that was not forced that never was inclined
to accessary yieldings but still pure
doth in her poisond closet yet endure


lo here the hopeless merchant of this loss
with head declined and voice dammd up with woe
with sad set eyes and wretched arms across
from lips newwaxen pale begins to blow
the grief away that stops his answer so
but wretched as he is he strives in vain
what he breathes out his breath drinks up again


as through an arch the violent roaring tide
outruns the eye that doth behold his haste
yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride
back to the strait that forced him on so fast
in rage sent out recalld in rage being past
even so his sighs his sorrows make a saw
to push grief on and back the same grief draw


which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth
and his untimely frenzy thus awaketh
dear lord thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth
another power no flood by raining slaketh
my woe too sensible thy passion maketh
more feelingpainful let it then suffice
to drown one woe one pair of weeping eyes


and for my sake when i might charm thee so
for she that was thy lucrece now attend me
be suddenly revenged on my foe
thine mine his own suppose thou dost defend me
from what is past the help that thou shalt lend me
comes all too late yet let the traitor die
for sparing justice feeds iniquity


but ere i name him you fair lords quoth she
speaking to those that came with collatine
shall plight your honourable faiths to me
with swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine
for tis a meritorious fair design
to chase injustice with revengeful arms
knights by their oaths should right poor ladies harms


at this request with noble disposition
each present lord began to promise aid
as bound in knighthood to her imposition
longing to hear the hateful foe bewrayd
but she that yet her sad task hath not said
the protestation stops o speak quoth she
how may this forced stain be wiped from me


what is the quality of mine offence
being constraind with dreadful circumstance
may my pure mind with the foul act dispense
my lowdeclined honour to advance
may any terms acquit me from this chance
the poisond fountain clears itself again
and why not i from this compelled stain


with this they all at once began to say
her bodys stain her mind untainted clears
while with a joyless smile she turns away
the face that map which deep impression bears
of hard misfortune carved in it with tears
no no quoth she no dame hereafter living
by my excuse shall claim excuses giving


here with a sigh as if her heart would break
she throws forth tarquins name he he she says
but more than he her poor tongue could not speak
till after many accents and delays
untimely breathings sick and short assays
she utters this he he fair lords tis he
that guides this hand to give this wound to me


even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
a harmful knife that thence her soul unsheathed
that blow did that it from the deep unrest
of that polluted prison where it breathed
her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeathd
her winged sprite and through her wounds doth fly
lifes lasting date from cancelld destiny


stonestill astonishd with this deadly deed
stood collatine and all his lordly crew
till lucrece father that beholds her bleed
himself on her selfslaughterd body threw
and from the purple fountain brutus drew
the murderous knife and as it left the place
her blood in poor revenge held it in chase


and bubbling from her breast it doth divide
in two slow rivers that the crimson blood
circles her body in on every side
who like a latesackd island vastly stood
bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood
some of her blood still pure and red remaind
and some lookd black and that false tarquin staind


about the mourning and congealed face
of that black blood a watery rigol goes
which seems to weep upon the tainted place
and ever since as pitying lucrece woes
corrupted blood some watery token shows
and blood untainted still doth red abide
blushing at that which is so putrified


daughter dear daughter old lucretius cries
that life was mine which thou hast here deprived
if in the child the fathers image lies
where shall i live now lucrece is unlived
thou wast not to this end from me derived
if children predecease progenitors
we are their offspring and they none of ours


poor broken glass i often did behold
in thy sweet semblance my old age new born
but now that fresh fair mirror dim and old
shows me a bareboned death by time outworn
o from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn
and shivered all the beauty of my glass
that i no more can see what once i was


o time cease thou thy course and last no longer
if they surcease to be that should survive
shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger
and leave the faltering feeble souls alive
the old bees die the young possess their hive
then live sweet lucrece live again and see
thy father die and not thy father thee


by this starts collatine as from a dream
and bids lucretius give his sorrow place
and then in keycold lucrece bleeding stream
he falls and bathes the pale fear in his face
and counterfeits to die with her a space
till manly shame bids him possess his breath
and live to be revenged on her death


the deep vexation of his inward soul
hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue
who mad that sorrow should his use control
or keep him from hearteasing words so long
begins to talk but through his lips do throng
weak words so thick come in his poor hearts aid
that no man could distinguish what he said


yet sometime tarquin was pronounced plain
but through his teeth as if the name he tore
this windy tempest till it blow up rain
held back his sorrows tide to make it more
at last it rains and busy winds give oer
then son and father weep with equal strife
who should weep most for daughter or for wife


the one doth call her his the other his
yet neither may possess the claim they lay
the father says shes mine o mine she is
replies her husband do not take away
my sorrows interest let no mourner say
he weeps for her for she was only mine
and only must be waild by collatine


o quoth lucretius i did give that life
which she too early and too late hath spilld
woe woe quoth collatine she was my wife
i owed her and tis mine that she hath killd
my daughter and my wife with clamours filld
the dispersed air who holding lucrece life
answerd their cries my daughter and my wife


brutus who pluckd the knife from lucrece side
seeing such emulation in their woe
began to clothe his wit in state and pride
burying in lucrece wound his follys show
he with the romans was esteemed so
as sillyjeering idiots are with kings
for sportive words and uttering foolish things


but now he throws that shallow habit by
wherein deep policy did him disguise
and armd his longhid wits advisedly
to cheque the tears in collatinus eyes
thou wronged lord of rome quoth be arise
let my unsounded self supposed a fool
now set thy longexperienced wit to school


why collatine is woe the cure for woe
do wounds help wounds or grief help grievous deeds
is it revenge to give thyself a blow
for his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds
such childish humour from weak minds proceeds
thy wretched wife mistook the matter so
to slay herself that should have slain her foe


courageous roman do not steep thy heart
in such relenting dew of lamentations
but kneel with me and help to bear thy part
to rouse our roman gods with invocations
that they will suffer these abominations
since rome herself in them doth stand disgraced
by our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased


now by the capitol that we adore
and by this chaste blood so unjustly staind
by heavens fair sun that breeds the fat earths store
by all our country rights in rome maintaind
and by chaste lucrece soul that late complaind
her wrongs to us and by this bloody knife
we will revenge the death of this true wife


this said he struck his hand upon his breast
and kissd the fatal knife to end his vow
and to his protestation urged the rest
who wondering at him did his words allow
then jointly to the ground their knees they bow
and that deep vow which brutus made before
he doth again repeat and that they swore


when they had sworn to this advised doom
they did conclude to bear dead lucrece thence
to show her bleeding body thorough rome
and so to publish tarquins foul offence
which being done with speedy diligence
the romans plausibly did give consent
to tarquins everlasting banishment


even as the sun with purplecolourd face
had taen his last leave of the weeping morn
rosecheekd adonis hied him to the chase
hunting he loved but love he laughd to scorn
sickthoughted venus makes amain unto him
and like a boldfaced suitor gins to woo him


thricefairer than myself thus she began
the fields chief flower sweet above compare
stain to all nymphs more lovely than a man
more white and red than doves or roses are
nature that made thee with herself at strife
saith that the world hath ending with thy life


vouchsafe thou wonder to alight thy steed
and rein his proud head to the saddlebow
if thou wilt deign this favour for thy meed
a thousand honey secrets shalt thou know
here come and sit where never serpent hisses
and being set ill smother thee with kisses


and yet not cloy thy lips with loathed satiety
but rather famish them amid their plenty
making them red and pale with fresh variety
ten kisses short as one one long as twenty
a summers day will seem an hour but short
being wasted in such timebeguiling sport


with this she seizeth on his sweating palm
the precedent of pith and livelihood
and trembling in her passion calls it balm
earths sovereign salve to do a goddess good
being so enraged desire doth lend her force
courageously to pluck him from his horse


over one arm the lusty coursers rein
under her other was the tender boy
who blushd and pouted in a dull disdain
with leaden appetite unapt to toy
she red and hot as coals of glowing fire
he red for shame but frosty in desire


the studded bridle on a ragged bough
nimbly she fastenso how quick is love
the steed is stalled up and even now
to tie the rider she begins to prove
backward she pushd him as she would be thrust
and governd him in strength though not in lust


so soon was she along as he was down
each leaning on their elbows and their hips
now doth she stroke his cheek now doth he frown
and gins to chide but soon she stops his lips
and kissing speaks with lustful language broken
if thou wilt chide thy lips shall never open


he burns with bashful shame she with her tears
doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks
then with her windy sighs and golden hairs
to fan and blow them dry again she seeks
he saith she is immodest blames her miss
what follows more she murders with a kiss


even as an empty eagle sharp by fast
tires with her beak on feathers flesh and bone
shaking her wings devouring all in haste
till either gorge be stuffd or prey be gone
even so she kissed his brow his cheek his chin
and where she ends she doth anew begin


forced to content but never to obey
panting he lies and breatheth in her face
she feedeth on the steam as on a prey
and calls it heavenly moisture air of grace
wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers
so they were dewd with such distilling showers


look how a bird lies tangled in a net
so fastend in her arms adonis lies
pure shame and awed resistance made him fret
which bred more beauty in his angry eyes
rain added to a river that is rank
perforce will force it overflow the bank


still she entreats and prettily entreats
for to a pretty ear she tunes her tale
still is he sullen still he lours and frets
twixt crimson shame and anger ashypale
being red she loves him best and being white
her best is betterd with a more delight


look how he can she cannot choose but love
and by her fair immortal hand she swears
from his soft bosom never to remove
till he take truce with her contending tears
which long have raind making her cheeks all wet
and one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt


upon this promise did he raise his chin
like a divedapper peering through a wave
who being lookd on ducks as quickly in
so offers he to give what she did crave
but when her lips were ready for his pay
he winks and turns his lips another way


never did passenger in summers heat
more thirst for drink than she for this good turn
her help she sees but help she cannot get
she bathes in water yet her fire must burn
o pity gan she cry flinthearted boy
tis but a kiss i beg why art thou coy


i have been wood as i entreat thee now
even by the stern and direful god of war
whose sinewy neck in battle neer did bow
who conquers where he comes in every jar
yet hath he been my captive and my slave
and beggd for that which thou unaskd shalt have


over my altars hath he hung his lance
his batterd shield his uncontrolled crest
and for my sake hath learnd to sport and dance
to toy to wanton dally smile and jest
scorning his churlish drum and ensign red
making my arms his field his tent my bed


thus he that overruled i overswayd
leading him prisoner in a redrose chain
strongtempered steel his stronger strength obeyd
yet was he servile to my coy disdain
o be not proud nor brag not of thy might
for mastering her that foild the god of fight


touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine
though mine be not so fair yet are they red
the kiss shall be thine own as well as mine
what seest thou in the ground hold up thy head
look in mine eyeballs there thy beauty lies
then why not lips on lips since eyes in eyes


art thou ashamed to kiss then wink again
and i will wink so shall the day seem night
love keeps his revels where they are but twain
be bold to play our sport is not in sight
these blueveind violets whereon we lean
never can blab nor know not what we mean


the tender spring upon thy tempting lip
shows thee unripe yet mayst thou well be tasted
make use of time let not advantage slip
beauty within itself should not be wasted
fair flowers that are not gatherd in their prime
rot and consume themselves in little time


were i hardfavourd foul or wrinkledold
illnurtured crooked churlish harsh in voice
oerworn despised rheumatic and cold
thicksighted barren lean and lacking juice
then mightst thou pause for then i were not for thee
but having no defects why dost abhor me


thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow
mine eyes are gray and bright and quick in turning
my beauty as the spring doth yearly grow
my flesh is soft and plump my marrow burning
my smooth moist hand were it with thy hand felt
would in thy palm dissolve or seem to melt


bid me discourse i will enchant thine ear
or like a fairy trip upon the green
or like a nymph with long dishevelld hair
dance on the sands and yet no footing seen
love is a spirit all compact of fire
not gross to sink but light and will aspire


witness this primrose bank whereon i lie
these forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me
two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky
from morn till night even where i list to sport me
is love so light sweet boy and may it be
that thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee


is thine own heart to thine own face affected
can thy right hand seize love upon thy left
then woo thyself be of thyself rejected
steal thine own freedom and complain on theft
narcissus so himself himself forsook
and died to kiss his shadow in the brook


torches are made to light jewels to wear
dainties to taste fresh beauty for the use
herbs for their smell and sappy plants to bear
things growing to themselves are growths abuse
seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty
thou wast begot to get it is thy duty


upon the earths increase why shouldst thou feed
unless the earth with thy increase be fed
by law of nature thou art bound to breed
that thine may live when thou thyself art dead
and so in spite of death thou dost survive
in that thy likeness still is left alive


by this the lovesick queen began to sweat
for where they lay the shadow had forsook them
and titan tired in the midday heat
with burning eye did hotly overlook them
wishing adonis had his team to guide
so he were like him and by venus side


and now adonis with a lazy spright
and with a heavy dark disliking eye
his louring brows oerwhelming his fair sight
like misty vapours when they blot the sky
souring his cheeks cries fie no more of love
the sun doth burn my face i must remove


ay me quoth venus young and so unkind
what bare excuses makest thou to be gone
ill sigh celestial breath whose gentle wind
shall cool the heat of this descending sun
ill make a shadow for thee of my hairs
if they burn too ill quench them with my tears


the sun that shines from heaven shines but warm
and lo i lie between that sun and thee
the heat i have from thence doth little harm
thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me
and were i not immortal life were done
between this heavenly and earthly sun


art thou obdurate flinty hard as steel
nay more than flint for stone at rain relenteth
art thou a womans son and canst not feel
what tis to love how want of love tormenteth
o had thy mother borne so hard a mind
she had not brought forth thee but died unkind


what am i that thou shouldst contemn me this
or what great danger dwells upon my suit
what were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss
speak fair but speak fair words or else be mute
give me one kiss ill give it thee again
and one for interest if thou wilt have twain


fie lifeless picture cold and senseless stone
wellpainted idol image dun and dead
statue contenting but the eye alone
thing like a man but of no woman bred
thou art no man though of a mans complexion
for men will kiss even by their own direction


this said impatience chokes her pleading tongue
and swelling passion doth provoke a pause
red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth he wrong
being judge in love she cannot right her cause
and now she weeps and now she fain would speak
and now her sobs do her intendments break


sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand
now gazeth she on him now on the ground
sometimes her arms infold him like a band
she would he will not in her arms be bound
and when from thence he struggles to be gone
she locks her lily fingers one in one


fondling she saith since i have hemmd thee here
within the circuit of this ivory pale
ill be a park and thou shalt be my deer
feed where thou wilt on mountain or in dale
graze on my lips and if those hills be dry
stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie


within this limit is relief enough
sweet bottomgrass and high delightful plain
round rising hillocks brakes obscure and rough
to shelter thee from tempest and from rain
then be my deer since i am such a park
no dog shall rouse thee though a thousand bark


at this adonis smiles as in disdain
that in each cheek appears a pretty dimple
love made those hollows if himself were slain
he might be buried in a tomb so simple
foreknowing well if there he came to lie
why there love lived and there he could not die


these lovely caves these round enchanting pits
opend their mouths to swallow venus liking
being mad before how doth she now for wits
struck dead at first what needs a second striking
poor queen of love in thine own law forlorn
to love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn


now which way shall she turn what shall she say
her words are done her woes are more increasing
the time is spent her object will away
and from her twining arms doth urge releasing
pity she cries some favour some remorse
away he springs and hasteth to his horse


but lo from forth a copse that neighbors by
a breeding jennet lusty young and proud
adonis trampling courser doth espy
and forth she rushes snorts and neighs aloud
the strongneckd steed being tied unto a tree
breaketh his rein and to her straight goes he


imperiously he leaps he neighs he bounds
and now his woven girths he breaks asunder
the bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds
whose hollow womb resounds like heavens thunder
the iron bit he crusheth tween his teeth
controlling what he was controlled with


his ears upprickd his braided hanging mane
upon his compassd crest now stand on end
his nostrils drink the air and forth again
as from a furnace vapours doth he send
his eye which scornfully glisters like fire
shows his hot courage and his high desire


sometime he trots as if he told the steps
with gentle majesty and modest pride
anon he rears upright curvets and leaps
as who should say lo thus my strength is tried
and this i do to captivate the eye
of the fair breeder that is standing by


what recketh he his riders angry stir
his flattering holla or his stand i say
what cares he now for curb or pricking spur
for rich caparisons or trapping gay
he sees his love and nothing else he sees
for nothing else with his proud sight agrees


look when a painter would surpass the life
in limning out a wellproportiond steed
his art with natures workmanship at strife
as if the dead the living should exceed
so did this horse excel a common one
in shape in courage colour pace and bone


roundhoofd shortjointed fetlocks shag and long
broad breast full eye small head and nostril wide
high crest short ears straight legs and passing strong
thin mane thick tail broad buttock tender hide
look what a horse should have he did not lack
save a proud rider on so proud a back


sometime he scuds far off and there he stares
anon he starts at stirring of a feather
to bid the wind a base he now prepares
and whether he run or fly they know not whether
for through his mane and tail the high wind sings
fanning the hairs who wave like featherd wings


he looks upon his love and neighs unto her
she answers him as if she knew his mind
being proud as females are to see him woo her
she puts on outward strangeness seems unkind
spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels
beating his kind embracements with her heels


then like a melancholy malcontent
he veils his tail that like a falling plume
cool shadow to his melting buttock lent
he stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume
his love perceiving how he is enraged
grew kinder and his fury was assuaged


his testy master goeth about to take him
when lo the unbackd breeder full of fear
jealous of catching swiftly doth forsake him
with her the horse and left adonis there
as they were mad unto the wood they hie them
outstripping crows that strive to overfly them


all swoln with chafing down adonis sits
banning his boisterous and unruly beast
and now the happy season once more fits
that lovesick love by pleading may be blest
for lovers say the heart hath treble wrong
when it is barrd the aidance of the tongue


an oven that is stoppd or river stayd
burneth more hotly swelleth with more rage
so of concealed sorrow may be said
free vent of words loves fire doth assuage
but when the hearts attorney once is mute
the client breaks as desperate in his suit


he sees her coming and begins to glow
even as a dying coal revives with wind
and with his bonnet hides his angry brow
looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind
taking no notice that she is so nigh
for all askance he holds her in his eye


o what a sight it was wistly to view
how she came stealing to the wayward boy
to note the fighting conflict of her hue
how white and red each other did destroy
but now her cheek was pale and by and by
it flashd forth fire as lightning from the sky


now was she just before him as he sat
and like a lowly lover down she kneels
with one fair hand she heaveth up his hat
her other tender hand his fair cheek feels
his tenderer cheek receives her soft hands print
as apt as newfalln snow takes any dint


o what a war of looks was then between them
her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing
his eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them
her eyes wood still his eyes disdaind the wooing
and all this dumb play had his acts made plain
with tears which choruslike her eyes did rain


full gently now she takes him by the hand
a lily prisond in a gaol of snow
or ivory in an alabaster band
so white a friend engirts so white a foe
this beauteous combat wilful and unwilling
showd like two silver doves that sit abilling


once more the engine of her thoughts began
o fairest mover on this mortal round
would thou wert as i am and i a man
my heart all whole as thine thy heart my wound
for one sweet look thy help i would assure thee
though nothing but my bodys bane would cure thee


give me my hand saith he why dost thou feel it
give me my heart saith she and thou shalt have it
o give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it
and being steeld soft sighs can never grave it
then loves deep groans i never shall regard
because adonis heart hath made mine hard


for shame he cries let go and let me go
my days delight is past my horse is gone
and tis your fault i am bereft him so
i pray you hence and leave me here alone
for all my mind my thought my busy care
is how to get my palfrey from the mare


thus she replies thy palfrey as he should
welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire
affection is a coal that must be coold
else sufferd it will set the heart on fire
the sea hath bounds but deep desire hath none
therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone


how like a jade he stood tied to the tree
servilely masterd with a leathern rein
but when he saw his love his youths fair fee
he held such petty bondage in disdain
throwing the base thong from his bending crest
enfranchising his mouth his back his breast


who sees his truelove in her naked bed
teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white
but when his glutton eye so full hath fed
his other agents aim at like delight
who is so faint that dare not be so bold
to touch the fire the weather being cold


let me excuse thy courser gentle boy
and learn of him i heartily beseech thee
to take advantage on presented joy
though i were dumb yet his proceedings teach thee
o learn to love the lesson is but plain
and once made perfect never lost again


i know not love quoth he nor will not know it
unless it be a boar and then i chase it
tis much to borrow and i will not owe it
my love to love is love but to disgrace it
for i have heard it is a life in death
that laughs and weeps and all but with a breath


who wears a garment shapeless and unfinishd
who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth
if springing things be any jot diminishd
they wither in their prime prove nothing worth
the colt thats backd and burdend being young
loseth his pride and never waxeth strong


you hurt my hand with wringing let us part
and leave this idle theme this bootless chat
remove your siege from my unyielding heart
to loves alarms it will not ope the gate
dismiss your vows your feigned tears your flattery
for where a heart is hard they make no battery


what canst thou talk quoth she hast thou a tongue
o would thou hadst not or i had no hearing
thy mermaids voice hath done me double wrong
i had my load before now pressd with bearing
melodious discord heavenly tune harshsounding
ears deepsweet music and hearts deepsore wounding


had i no eyes but ears my ears would love
that inward beauty and invisible
or were i deaf thy outward parts would move
each part in me that were but sensible
though neither eyes nor ears to hear nor see
yet should i be in love by touching thee


say that the sense of feeling were bereft me
and that i could not see nor hear nor touch
and nothing but the very smell were left me
yet would my love to thee be still as much
for from the stillitory of thy face excelling
comes breath perfumed that breedeth love by smelling


but o what banquet wert thou to the taste
being nurse and feeder of the other four
would they not wish the feast might ever last
and bid suspicion doublelock the door
lest jealousy that sour unwelcome guest
should by his stealing in disturb the feast


once more the rubycolourd portal opend
which to his speech did honey passage yield
like a red morn that ever yet betokend
wreck to the seaman tempest to the field
sorrow to shepherds woe unto the birds
gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds


this ill presage advisedly she marketh
even as the wind is hushd before it raineth
or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh
or as the berry breaks before it staineth
or like the deadly bullet of a gun
his meaning struck her ere his words begun


and at his look she flatly falleth down
for looks kill love and love by looks reviveth
a smile recures the wounding of a frown
but blessed bankrupt that by love so thriveth
the silly boy believing she is dead
claps her pale cheek till clapping makes it red


and all amazed brake off his late intent
for sharply he did think to reprehend her
which cunning love did wittily prevent
fair fall the wit that can so well defend her
for on the grass she lies as she were slain
till his breath breatheth life in her again


he wrings her nose he strikes her on the cheeks
he bends her fingers holds her pulses hard
he chafes her lips a thousand ways he seeks
to mend the hurt that his unkindness marrd
he kisses her and she by her good will
will never rise so he will kiss her still


the night of sorrow now is turnd to day
her two blue windows faintly she upheaveth
like the fair sun when in his fresh array
he cheers the morn and all the earth relieveth
and as the bright sun glorifies the sky
so is her face illumined with her eye


whose beams upon his hairless face are fixd
as if from thence they borrowd all their shine
were never four such lamps together mixd
had not his clouded with his brows repine
but hers which through the crystal tears gave light
shone like the moon in water seen by night


o where am i quoth she in earth or heaven
or in the ocean drenchd or in the fire
what hour is this or morn or weary even
do i delight to die or life desire
but now i lived and life was deaths annoy
but now i died and death was lively joy


o thou didst kill me kill me once again
thy eyes shrewd tutor that hard heart of thine
hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain
that they have murderd this poor heart of mine
and these mine eyes true leaders to their queen
but for thy piteous lips no more had seen


long may they kiss each other for this cure
o never let their crimson liveries wear
and as they last their verdure still endure
to drive infection from the dangerous year
that the stargazers having writ on death
may say the plague is banishd by thy breath


pure lips sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted
what bargains may i make still to be sealing
to sell myself i can be well contented
so thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing
which purchase if thou make for fear of slips
set thy sealmanual on my waxred lips


a thousand kisses buys my heart from me
and pay them at thy leisure one by one
what is ten hundred touches unto thee
are they not quickly told and quickly gone
say for nonpayment that the debt should double
is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble


fair queen quoth he if any love you owe me
measure my strangeness with my unripe years
before i know myself seek not to know me
no fisher but the ungrown fry forbears
the mellow plum doth fall the green sticks fast
or being early pluckd is sour to taste


look the worlds comforter with weary gait
his days hot task hath ended in the west
the owl nights herald shrieks tis very late
the sheep are gone to fold birds to their nest
and coalblack clouds that shadow heavens light
do summon us to part and bid good night


now let me say good night and so say you
if you will say so you shall have a kiss
good night quoth she and ere he says adieu
the honey fee of parting tenderd is
her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace
incorporate then they seem face grows to face


till breathless he disjoind and backward drew
the heavenly moisture that sweet coral mouth
whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew
whereon they surfeit yet complain on drouth
he with her plenty pressd she faint with dearth
their lips together glued fall to the earth


now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey
and gluttonlike she feeds yet never filleth
her lips are conquerors his lips obey
paying what ransom the insulter willeth
whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high
that she will draw his lips rich treasure dry


and having felt the sweetness of the spoil
with blindfold fury she begins to forage
her face doth reek and smoke her blood doth boil
and careless lust stirs up a desperate courage
planting oblivion beating reason back
forgetting shames pure blush and honours wrack


hot faint and weary with her hard embracing
like a wild bird being tamed with too much handling
or as the fleetfoot roe thats tired with chasing
or like the froward infant stilld with dandling
he now obeys and now no more resisteth
while she takes all she can not all she listeth


what wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering
and yields at last to every light impression
things out of hope are compassd oft with venturing
chiefly in love whose leave exceeds commission
affection faints not like a palefaced coward
but then woos best when most his choice is froward


when he did frown o had she then gave over
such nectar from his lips she had not suckd
foul words and frowns must not repel a lover
what though the rose have prickles yet tis pluckd
were beauty under twenty locks kept fast
yet love breaks through and picks them all at last


for pity now she can no more detain him
the poor fool prays her that he may depart
she is resolved no longer to restrain him
bids him farewell and look well to her heart
the which by cupids bow she doth protest
he carries thence incaged in his breast


sweet boy she says this night ill waste in sorrow
for my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch
tell me loves master shall we meet tomorrow
say shall we shall we wilt thou make the match
he tells her no tomorrow he intends
to hunt the boar with certain of his friends


the boar quoth she whereat a sudden pale
like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose
usurps her cheek she trembles at his tale
and on his neck her yoking arms she throws
she sinketh down still hanging by his neck
he on her belly falls she on her back


now is she in the very lists of love
her champion mounted for the hot encounter
all is imaginary she doth prove
he will not manage her although he mount her
that worse than tantalus is her annoy
to clip elysium and to lack her joy


even as poor birds deceived with painted grapes
do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw
even so she languisheth in her mishaps
as those poor birds that helpless berries saw
the warm effects which she in him finds missing
she seeks to kindle with continual kissing


but all in vain good queen it will not be
she hath assayd as much as may be proved
her pleading hath deserved a greater fee
shes love she loves and yet she is not loved
fie fie he says you crush me let me go
you have no reason to withhold me so


thou hadst been gone quoth she sweet boy ere this
but that thou toldst me thou wouldst hunt the boar
o be advised thou knowst not what it is
with javelins point a churlish swine to gore
whose tushes never sheathed he whetteth still
like to a mortal butcher bent to kill


on his bowback he hath a battle set
of bristly pikes that ever threat his foes
his eyes like glowworms shine when he doth fret
his snout digs sepulchres whereer he goes
being moved he strikes whateer is in his way
and whom he strikes his cruel tushes slay


his brawny sides with hairy bristles armd
are better proof than thy spears point can enter
his short thick neck cannot be easily harmd
being ireful on the lion he will venture
the thorny brambles and embracing bushes
as fearful of him part through whom he rushes


alas he nought esteems that face of thine
to which loves eyes pay tributary gazes
nor thy soft hands sweet lips and crystal eyne
whose full perfection all the world amazes
but having thee at vantagewondrous dread
would root these beauties as he roots the mead


o let him keep his loathsome cabin still
beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends
come not within his danger by thy will
they that thrive well take counsel of their friends
when thou didst name the boar not to dissemble
i feard thy fortune and my joints did tremble


didst thou not mark my face was it not white
sawst thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye
grew i not faint and fell i not downright
within my bosom whereon thou dost lie
my boding heart pants beats and takes no rest
but like an earthquake shakes thee on my breast


for where love reigns disturbing jealousy
doth call himself affections sentinel
gives false alarms suggesteth mutiny
and in a peaceful hour doth cry kill kill
distempering gentle love in his desire
as air and water do abate the fire


this sour informer this batebreeding spy
this canker that eats up loves tender spring
this carrytale dissentious jealousy
that sometime true news sometime false doth bring
knocks at my heat and whispers in mine ear
that if i love thee i thy death should fear


and more than so presenteth to mine eye
the picture of an angrychafing boar
under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie
an image like thyself all staind with gore
whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed
doth make them droop with grief and hang the head


what should i do seeing thee so indeed
that tremble at the imagination
the thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed
and fear doth teach it divination
i prophesy thy death my living sorrow
if thou encounter with the boar tomorrow


but if thou needs wilt hunt be ruled by me
uncouple at the timorous flying hare
or at the fox which lives by subtlety
or at the roe which no encounter dare
pursue these fearful creatures oer the downs
and on thy wellbreathd horse keep with thy hounds


and when thou hast on foot the purblind hare
mark the poor wretch to overshoot his troubles
how he outruns the wind and with what care
he cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles
the many musets through the which he goes
are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes


sometime he runs among a flock of sheep
to make the cunning hounds mistake their smell
and sometime where earthdelving conies keep
to stop the loud pursuers in their yell
and sometime sorteth with a herd of deer
danger deviseth shifts wit waits on fear


for there his smell with others being mingled
the hot scentsnuffing hounds are driven to doubt
ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
with much ado the cold fault cleanly out
then do they spend their mouths echo replies
as if another chase were in the skies


by this poor wat far off upon a hill
stands on his hinder legs with listening ear
to harken if his foes pursue him still
anon their loud alarums he doth hear
and now his grief may be compared well
to one sore sick that hears the passingbell


then shalt thou see the dewbedabbled wretch
turn and return indenting with the way
each envious brier his weary legs doth scratch
each shadow makes him stop each murmur stay
for misery is trodden on by many
and being low never relieved by any


lie quietly and hear a little more
nay do not struggle for thou shalt not rise
to make thee hate the hunting of the boar
unlike myself thou hearst me moralize
applying this to that and so to so
for love can comment upon every woe


where did i leave no matter where quoth he
leave me and then the story aptly ends
the night is spent why what of that quoth she
i am quoth he expected of my friends
and now tis dark and going i shall fall
in night quoth she desire sees best of all


but if thou fall o then imagine this
the earth in love with thee thy footing trips
and all is but to rob thee of a kiss
rich preys make true men thieves so do thy lips
make modest dian cloudy and forlorn
lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn


now of this dark night i perceive the reason
cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine
till forging nature be condemnd of treason
for stealing moulds from heaven that were divine
wherein she framed thee in high heavens despite
to shame the sun by day and her by night


and therefore hath she bribed the destinies
to cross the curious workmanship of nature
to mingle beauty with infirmities
and pure perfection with impure defeature
making it subject to the tyranny
of mad mischances and much misery


as burning fevers agues pale and faint
lifepoisoning pestilence and frenzies wood
the marroweating sickness whose attaint
disorder breeds by heating of the blood
surfeits imposthumes grief and damnd despair
swear natures death for framing thee so fair


and not the least of all these maladies
but in one minutes fight brings beauty under
both favour savour hue and qualities
whereat the impartial gazer late did wonder
are on the sudden wasted thawd and done
as mountainsnow melts with the midday sun


therefore despite of fruitless chastity
lovelacking vestals and selfloving nuns
that on the earth would breed a scarcity
and barren dearth of daughters and of sons
be prodigal the lamp that burns by night
dries up his oil to lend the world his light


what is thy body but a swallowing grave
seeming to bury that posterity
which by the rights of time thou needs must have
if thou destroy them not in dark obscurity
if so the world will hold thee in disdain
sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain


so in thyself thyself art made away
a mischief worse than civil homebred strife
or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay
or butchersire that reaves his son of life
foulcankering rust the hidden treasure frets
but gold thats put to use more gold begets


nay then quoth adon you will fall again
into your idle overhandled theme
the kiss i gave you is bestowd in vain
and all in vain you strive against the stream
for by this blackfaced night desires foul nurse
your treatise makes me like you worse and worse


if love have lent you twenty thousand tongues
and every tongue more moving than your own
bewitching like the wanton mermaids songs
yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown
for know my heart stands armed in mine ear
and will not let a false sound enter there


lest the deceiving harmony should run
into the quiet closure of my breast
and then my little heart were quite undone
in his bedchamber to be barrd of rest
no lady no my heart longs not to groan
but soundly sleeps while now it sleeps alone


what have you urged that i cannot reprove
the path is smooth that leadeth on to danger
i hate not love but your device in love
that lends embracements unto every stranger
you do it for increase o strange excuse
when reason is the bawd to lusts abuse


call it not love for love to heaven is fled
since sweating lust on earth usurpd his name
under whose simple semblance he hath fed
upon fresh beauty blotting it with blame
which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves
as caterpillars do the tender leaves


love comforteth like sunshine after rain
but lusts effect is tempest after sun
loves gentle spring doth always fresh remain
lusts winter comes ere summer half be done
love surfeits not lust like a glutton dies
love is all truth lust full of forged lies


more i could tell but more i dare not say
the text is old the orator too green
therefore in sadness now i will away
my face is full of shame my heart of teen
mine ears that to your wanton talk attended
do burn themselves for having so offended


with this he breaketh from the sweet embrace
of those fair arms which bound him to her breast
and homeward through the dark laund runs apace
leaves love upon her back deeply distressd
look how a bright star shooteth from the sky
so glides he in the night from venus eye


which after him she darts as one on shore
gazing upon a lateembarked friend
till the wild waves will have him seen no more
whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend
so did the merciless and pitchy night
fold in the object that did feed her sight


whereat amazed as one that unaware
hath droppd a precious jewel in the flood
or stonishd as nightwanderers often are
their light blown out in some mistrustful wood
even so confounded in the dark she lay
having lost the fair discovery of her way


and now she beats her heart whereat it groans
that all the neighbour caves as seeming troubled
make verbal repetition of her moans
passion on passion deeply is redoubled
ay me she cries and twenty times woe woe
and twenty echoes twenty times cry so


she marking them begins a wailing note
and sings extemporally a woeful ditty
how love makes young men thrall and old men dote
how love is wise in folly foolishwitty
her heavy anthem still concludes in woe
and still the choir of echoes answer so


her song was tedious and outwore the night
for lovers hours are long though seeming short
if pleased themselves others they think delight
in suchlike circumstance with suchlike sport
their copious stories oftentimes begun
end without audience and are never done


for who hath she to spend the night withal
but idle sounds resembling parasites
like shrilltongued tapsters answering every call
soothing the humour of fantastic wits
she says tis so they answer all tis so
and would say after her if she said no


lo here the gentle lark weary of rest
from his moist cabinet mounts up on high
and wakes the morning from whose silver breast
the sun ariseth in his majesty
who doth the world so gloriously behold
that cedartops and hills seem burnishd gold


venus salutes him with this fair goodmorrow
o thou clear god and patron of all light
from whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
the beauteous influence that makes him bright
there lives a son that suckd an earthly mother
may lend thee light as thou dost lend to other


this said she hasteth to a myrtle grove
musing the morning is so much oerworn
and yet she hears no tidings of her love
she hearkens for his hounds and for his horn
anon she hears them chant it lustily
and all in haste she coasteth to the cry


and as she runs the bushes in the way
some catch her by the neck some kiss her face
some twine about her thigh to make her stay
she wildly breaketh from their strict embrace
like a milch doe whose swelling dugs do ache
hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake


by this she hears the hounds are at a bay
whereat she starts like one that spies an adder
wreathed up in fatal folds just in his way
the fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder
even so the timorous yelping of the hounds
appals her senses and her spirit confounds


for now she knows it is no gentle chase
but the blunt boar rough bear or lion proud
because the cry remaineth in one place
where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud
finding their enemy to be so curst
they all strain courtesy who shall cope him first


this dismal cry rings sadly in her ear
through which it enters to surprise her heart
who overcome by doubt and bloodless fear
with coldpale weakness numbs each feeling part
like soldiers when their captain once doth yield
they basely fly and dare not stay the field


thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy
till cheering up her senses all dismayd
she tells them tis a causeless fantasy
and childish error that they are afraid
bids them leave quaking bids them fear no more
and with that word she spied the hunted boar


whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red
like milk and blood being mingled both together
a second fear through all her sinews spread
which madly hurries her she knows not whither
this way runs and now she will no further
but back retires to rate the boar for murther


a thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways
she treads the path that she untreads again
her more than haste is mated with delays
like the proceedings of a drunken brain
full of respects yet nought at all respecting
in hand with all things nought at all effecting


here kennelld in a brake she finds a hound
and asks the weary caitiff for his master
and there another licking of his wound
gainst venomd sores the only sovereign plaster
and here she meets another sadly scowling
to whom she speaks and he replies with howling


when he hath ceased his illresounding noise
another flapmouthd mourner black and grim
against the welkin volleys out his voice
another and another answer him
clapping their proud tails to the ground below
shaking their scratchd ears bleeding as they go


look how the worlds poor people are amazed
at apparitions signs and prodigies
whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed
infusing them with dreadful prophecies
so she at these sad signs draws up her breath
and sighing it again exclaims on death


hardfavourd tyrant ugly meagre lean
hateful divorce of lovethus chides she death
grimgrinning ghost earths worm what dost thou mean
to stifle beauty and to steal his breath
who when he lived his breath and beauty set
gloss on the rose smell to the violet


if he be deado no it cannot be
seeing his beauty thou shouldst strike at it
o yes it may thou hast no eyes to see
but hatefully at random dost thou hit
thy mark is feeble age but thy false dart
mistakes that aim and cleaves an infants heart


hadst thou but bid beware then he had spoke
and hearing him thy power had lost his power
the destinies will curse thee for this stroke
they bid thee crop a weed thou pluckst a flower
loves golden arrow at him should have fled
and not deaths ebon dart to strike dead


dost thou drink tears that thou provokest such weeping
what may a heavy groan advantage thee
why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping
those eyes that taught all other eyes to see
now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour
since her best work is ruind with thy rigour


here overcome as one full of despair
she vaild her eyelids who like sluices stopt
the crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair
in the sweet channel of her bosom dropt
but through the floodgates breaks the silver rain
and with his strong course opens them again


o how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow
her eyes seen in the tears tears in her eye
both crystals where they viewd each others sorrow
sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry
but like a stormy day now wind now rain
sighs dry her cheeks tears make them wet again


variable passions throng her constant woe
as striving who should best become her grief
all entertaind each passion labours so
that every present sorrow seemeth chief
but none is best then join they all together
like many clouds consulting for foul weather


by this far off she hears some huntsman hollo
a nurses song neer pleased her babe so well
the dire imagination she did follow
this sound of hope doth labour to expel
for now reviving joy bids her rejoice
and flatters her it is adonis voice


whereat her tears began to turn their tide
being prisond in her eye like pearls in glass
yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside
which her cheek melts as scorning it should pass
to wash the foul face of the sluttish ground
who is but drunken when she seemeth drownd


o hardbelieving love how strange it seems
not to believe and yet too credulous
thy weal and woe are both of them extremes
despair and hope makes thee ridiculous
the one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely
in likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly


now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought
adonis lives and death is not to blame
it was not she that calld him allto naught
now she adds honours to his hateful name
she clepes him king of graves and grave for kings
imperious supreme of all mortal things


no no quoth she sweet death i did but jest
yet pardon me i felt a kind of fear
when as i met the boar that bloody beast
which knows no pity but is still severe
then gentle shadowtruth i must confess
i raild on thee fearing my loves decease


tis not my fault the boar provoked my tongue
be wreakd on him invisible commander
tis he foul creature that hath done thee wrong
i did but act hes author of thy slander
grief hath two tongues and never woman yet
could rule them both without ten womens wit


thus hoping that adonis is alive
her rash suspect she doth extenuate
and that his beauty may the better thrive
with death she humbly doth insinuate
tells him of trophies statues tombs and stories
his victories his triumphs and his glories


o jove quoth she how much a fool was i
to be of such a weak and silly mind
to wail his death who lives and must not die
till mutual overthrow of mortal kind
for he being dead with him is beauty slain
and beauty dead black chaos comes again


fie fie fond love thou art so full of fear
as one with treasure laden hemmd thieves
trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear
thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves
even at this word she hears a merry horn
whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn


as falcon to the lure away she flies
the grass stoops not she treads on it so light
and in her haste unfortunately spies
the foul boars conquest on her fair delight
which seen her eyes as murderd with the view
like stars ashamed of day themselves withdrew


or as the snail whose tender horns being hit
shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain
and there all smotherd up in shade doth sit
long after fearing to creep forth again
so at his bloody view her eyes are fled
into the deep dark cabins of her head


where they resign their office and their light
to the disposing of her troubled brain
who bids them still consort with ugly night
and never wound the heart with looks again
who like a king perplexed in his throne
by their suggestion gives a deadly groan


whereat each tributary subject quakes
as when the wind imprisond in the ground
struggling for passage earths foundation shakes
which with cold terror doth mens minds confound
this mutiny each part doth so surprise
that from their dark beds once more leap her eyes


and being opend threw unwilling light
upon the wide wound that the boar had trenchd
in his soft flank whose wonted lily white
with purple tears that his wound wept was drenchd
no flower was nigh no grass herb leaf or weed
but stole his blood and seemd with him to bleed


this solemn sympathy poor venus noteth
over one shoulder doth she hang her head
dumbly she passions franticly she doteth
she thinks he could not die he is not dead
her voice is stopt her joints forget to bow
her eyes are mad that they have wept til now


upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly
that her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three
and then she reprehends her mangling eye
that makes more gashes where no breach should be
his face seems twain each several limb is doubled
for oft the eye mistakes the brain being troubled


my tongue cannot express my grief for one
and yet quoth she behold two adons dead
my sighs are blown away my salt tears gone
mine eyes are turnd to fire my heart to lead
heavy hearts lead melt at mine eyes red fire
so shall i die by drops of hot desire


alas poor world what treasure hast thou lost
what face remains alive thats worth the viewing
whose tongue is music now what canst thou boast
of things long since or any thing ensuing
the flowers are sweet their colours fresh and trim
but truesweet beauty lived and died with him


bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear
nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you
having no fair to lose you need not fear
the sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you
but when adonis lived sun and sharp air
lurkd like two thieves to rob him of his fair


and therefore would he put his bonnet on
under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep
the wind would blow it off and being gone
play with his locks then would adonis weep
and straight in pity of his tender years
they both would strive who first should dry his tears


to see his face the lion walkd along
behind some hedge because he would not fear him
to recreate himself when he hath sung
the tiger would be tame and gently hear him
if he had spoke the wolf would leave his prey
and never fright the silly lamb that day


when he beheld his shadow in the brook
the fishes spread on it their golden gills
when he was by the birds such pleasure took
that some would sing some other in their bills
would bring him mulberries and ripered cherries
he fed them with his sight they him with berries


but this foul grim and urchinsnouted boar
whose downward eye still looketh for a grave
neer saw the beauteous livery that he wore
witness the entertainment that he gave
if he did see his face why then i know
he thought to kiss him and hath killd him so


tis true tis true thus was adonis slain
he ran upon the boar with his sharp spear
who did not whet his teeth at him again
but by a kiss thought to persuade him there
and nuzzling in his flank the loving swine
sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin


had i been toothd like him i must confess
with kissing him i should have killd him first
but he is dead and never did he bless
my youth with his the more am i accurst
with this she falleth in the place she stood
and stains her face with his congealed blood


she looks upon his lips and they are pale
she takes him by the hand and that is cold
she whispers in his ears a heavy tale
as if they heard the woeful words she told
she lifts the cofferlids that close his eyes
where lo two lamps burnt out in darkness lies


two glasses where herself herself beheld
a thousand times and now no more reflect
their virtue lost wherein they late excelld
and every beauty robbd of his effect
wonder of time quoth she this is my spite
that thou being dead the day should yet be light


since thou art dead lo here i prophesy
sorrow on love hereafter shall attend
it shall be waited on with jealousy
find sweet beginning but unsavoury end
neer settled equally but high or low
that all loves pleasure shall not match his woe


it shall be fickle false and full of fraud
bud and be blasted in a breathingwhile
the bottom poison and the top oerstrawd
with sweets that shall the truest sight beguile
the strongest body shall it make most weak
strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak


it shall be sparing and too full of riot
teaching decrepit age to tread the measures
the staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet
pluck down the rich enrich the poor with treasures
it shall be ragingmad and sillymild
make the young old the old become a child


it shall suspect where is no cause of fear
it shall not fear where it should most mistrust
it shall be merciful and too severe
and most deceiving when it seems most just
perverse it shall be where it shows most toward
put fear to valour courage to the coward


it shall be cause of war and dire events
and set dissension twixt the son and sire
subject and servile to all discontents
as dry combustious matter is to fire
sith in his prime death doth my love destroy
they that love best their loves shall not enjoy


by this the boy that by her side lay killd
was melted like a vapour from her sight
and in his blood that on the ground lay spilld
a purple flower sprung up chequerd with white
resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood
which in round drops upon their whiteness stood


she bows her head the newsprung flower to smell
comparing it to her adonis breath
and says within her bosom it shall dwell
since he himself is reft from her by death
she crops the stalk and in the breach appears
green dropping sap which she compares to tears


poor flower quoth she this was thy fathers guise
sweet issue of a more sweetsmelling sire
for every little grief to wet his eyes
to grow unto himself was his desire
and so tis thine but know it is as good
to wither in my breast as in his blood


here was thy fathers bed here in my breast
thou art the next of blood and tis thy right
lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest
my throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night
there shall not be one minute in an hour
wherein i will not kiss my sweet loves flower


thus weary of the world away she hies
and yokes her silver doves by whose swift aid
their mistress mounted through the empty skies
in her light chariot quickly is conveyd
holding their course to paphos where their queen
means to immure herself and not be seen


from fairest creatures we desire increase
that thereby beautys rose might never die
but as the riper should by time decease
his tender heir might bear his memory
but thou contracted to thine own bright eyes
feedst thy lightst flame with self substantial fuel
making a famine where abundance lies
thyself thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel
thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament
and only herald to the gaudy spring
within thine own bud buriest thy content
and tender churl makest waste in niggarding
pity the world or else this glutton be
to eat the worlds due by the grave and thee


when forty winters shall beseige thy brow
and dig deep trenches in thy beautys field
thy youths proud livery so gazed on now
will be a tatterd weed of small worth held
then being askd where all thy beauty lies
where all the treasure of thy lusty days
to say within thine own deep sunken eyes
were an all eating shame and thriftless praise
how much more praise deserved thy beautys use
if thou couldst answer this fair child of mine
shall sum my count and make my old excuse
proving his beauty by succession thine
this were to be new made when thou art old
and see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold


look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
now is the time that face should form another
whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest
thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother
for where is she so fair whose uneard womb
disdains the tillage of thy husbandry
or who is he so fond will be the tomb
of his self love to stop posterity
thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee
calls back the lovely april of her prime
so thou through windows of thine age shall see
despite of wrinkles this thy golden time
but if thou live rememberd not to be
die single and thine image dies with thee


unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend
upon thyself thy beautys legacy
natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend
and being frank she lends to those are free
then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse
the bounteous largess given thee to give
profitless usurer why dost thou use
so great a sum of sums yet canst not live
for having traffic with thyself alone
thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive
then how when nature calls thee to be gone
what acceptable audit canst thou leave
thy unused beauty must be tombd with thee
which used lives th executor to be


those hours that with gentle work did frame
the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
will play the tyrants to the very same
and that unfair which fairly doth excel
for never resting time leads summer on
to hideous winter and confounds him there
sap chequed with frost and lusty leaves quite gone
beauty oersnowd and bareness every where
then were not summers distillation left
a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass
beautys effect with beauty were bereft
nor it nor no remembrance what it was
but flowers distilld though they with winter meet
leese but their show their substance still lives sweet


then let not winters ragged hand deface
in thee thy summer ere thou be distilld
make sweet some vial treasure thou some place
with beautys treasure ere it be self killd
that use is not forbidden usury
which happies those that pay the willing loan
thats for thyself to breed another thee
or ten times happier be it ten for one
ten times thyself were happier than thou art
if ten of thine ten times refigured thee
then what could death do if thou shouldst depart
leaving thee living in posterity
be not self willd for thou art much too fair
to be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir


lo in the orient when the gracious light
lifts up his burning head each under eye
doth homage to his new appearing sight
serving with looks his sacred majesty
and having climbd the steep up heavenly hill
resembling strong youth in his middle age
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still
attending on his golden pilgrimage
but when from highmost pitch with weary car
like feeble age he reeleth from the day
the eyes fore duteous now converted are
from his low tract and look another way
so thou thyself out going in thy noon
unlookd on diest unless thou get a son


music to hear why hearst thou music sadly
sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy
why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly
or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy
if the true concord of well tuned sounds
by unions married do offend thine ear
they do but sweetly chide thee who confounds
in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear
mark how one string sweet husband to another
strikes each in each by mutual ordering
resembling sire and child and happy mother
who all in one one pleasing note do sing
whose speechless song being many seeming one
sings this to thee thou single wilt prove none


is it for fear to wet a widows eye
that thou consumest thyself in single life
ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die
the world will wail thee like a makeless wife
the world will be thy widow and still weep
that thou no form of thee hast left behind
when every private widow well may keep
by childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind
look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it
but beautys waste hath in the world an end
and kept unused the user so destroys it
no love toward others in that bosom sits
that on himself such murderous shame commits


for shame deny that thou bearst love to any
who for thyself art so unprovident
grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many
but that thou none lovest is most evident
for thou art so possessd with murderous hate
that gainst thyself thou stickst not to conspire
seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
which to repair should be thy chief desire
o change thy thought that i may change my mind
shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love
be as thy presence is gracious and kind
or to thyself at least kind hearted prove
make thee another self for love of me
that beauty still may live in thine or thee


as fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growest
in one of thine from that which thou departest
and that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest
thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest
herein lives wisdom beauty and increase
without this folly age and cold decay
if all were minded so the times should cease
and threescore year would make the world away
let those whom nature hath not made for store
harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish
look whom she best endowd she gave the more
which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish
she carved thee for her seal and meant thereby
thou shouldst print more not let that copy die


when i do count the clock that tells the time
and see the brave day sunk in hideous night
when i behold the violet past prime
and sable curls all silverd oer with white
when lofty trees i see barren of leaves
which erst from heat did canopy the herd
and summers green all girded up in sheaves
borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
then of thy beauty do i question make
that thou among the wastes of time must go
since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
and die as fast as they see others grow
and nothing gainst times scythe can make defence
save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence


o that you were yourself but love you are
no longer yours than you yourself here live
against this coming end you should prepare
and your sweet semblance to some other give
so should that beauty which you hold in lease
find no determination then you were
yourself again after yourselfs decease
when your sweet issue your sweet form should bear
who lets so fair a house fall to decay
which husbandry in honour might uphold
against the stormy gusts of winters day
and barren rage of deaths eternal cold
o none but unthrifts dear my love you know
you had a father let your son say so


not from the stars do i my judgment pluck
and yet methinks i have astronomy
but not to tell of good or evil luck
of plagues of dearths or seasons quality
nor can i fortune to brief minutes tell
pointing to each his thunder rain and wind
or say with princes if it shall go well
by oft predict that i in heaven find
but from thine eyes my knowledge i derive
and constant stars in them i read such art
as truth and beauty shall together thrive
if from thyself to store thou wouldst convert
or else of thee this i prognosticate
thy end is truths and beautys doom and date


when i consider every thing that grows
holds in perfection but a little moment
that this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
whereon the stars in secret influence comment
when i perceive that men as plants increase
cheered and chequed even by the self same sky
vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease
and wear their brave state out of memory
then the conceit of this inconstant stay
sets you most rich in youth before my sight
where wasteful time debateth with decay
to change your day of youth to sullied night
and all in war with time for love of you
as he takes from you i engraft you new


but wherefore do not you a mightier way
make war upon this bloody tyrant time
and fortify yourself in your decay
with means more blessed than my barren rhyme
now stand you on the top of happy hours
and many maiden gardens yet unset
with virtuous wish would bear your living flowers
much liker than your painted counterfeit
so should the lines of life that life repair
which this times pencil or my pupil pen
neither in inward worth nor outward fair
can make you live yourself in eyes of men
to give away yourself keeps yourself still
and you must live drawn by your own sweet skill


who will believe my verse in time to come
if it were filld with your most high deserts
though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb
which hides your life and shows not half your parts
if i could write the beauty of your eyes
and in fresh numbers number all your graces
the age to come would say this poet lies
such heavenly touches neer touchd earthly faces
so should my papers yellowd with their age
be scornd like old men of less truth than tongue
and your true rights be termd a poets rage
and stretched metre of an antique song
but were some child of yours alive that time
you should live twice in it and in my rhyme


shall i compare thee to a summers day
thou art more lovely and more temperate
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may
and summers lease hath all too short a date
sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines
and often is his gold complexion dimmd
and every fair from fair sometime declines
by chance or natures changing course untrimmd
but thy eternal summer shall not fade
nor lose possession of that fair thou owest
nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade
when in eternal lines to time thou growest
so long as men can breathe or eyes can see
so long lives this and this gives life to thee


devouring time blunt thou the lions paws
and make the earth devour her own sweet brood
pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws
and burn the long lived phoenix in her blood
make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets
and do whateer thou wilt swift footed time
to the wide world and all her fading sweets
but i forbid thee one most heinous crime
o carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow
nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen
him in thy course untainted do allow
for beautys pattern to succeeding men
yet do thy worst old time despite thy wrong
my love shall in my verse ever live young


a womans face with natures own hand painted
hast thou the master mistress of my passion
a womans gentle heart but not acquainted
with shifting change as is false womens fashion
an eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling
gilding the object whereupon it gazeth
a man in hue all hues in his controlling
much steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth
and for a woman wert thou first created
till nature as she wrought thee fell a doting
and by addition me of thee defeated
by adding one thing to my purpose nothing
but since she prickd thee out for womens pleasure
mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure


so is it not with me as with that muse
stirrd by a painted beauty to his verse
who heaven itself for ornament doth use
and every fair with his fair doth rehearse
making a couplement of proud compare
with sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems
with aprils first born flowers and all things rare
that heavens air in this huge rondure hems
o let me true in love but truly write
and then believe me my love is as fair
as any mothers child though not so bright
as those gold candles fixd in heavens air
let them say more than like of hearsay well
i will not praise that purpose not to sell


my glass shall not persuade me i am old
so long as youth and thou are of one date
but when in thee times furrows i behold
then look i death my days should expiate
for all that beauty that doth cover thee
is but the seemly raiment of my heart
which in thy breast doth live as thine in me
how can i then be elder than thou art
o therefore love be of thyself so wary
as i not for myself but for thee will
bearing thy heart which i will keep so chary
as tender nurse her babe from faring ill
presume not on thy heart when mine is slain
thou gavest me thine not to give back again


as an unperfect actor on the stage
who with his fear is put besides his part
or some fierce thing replete with too much rage
whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart
so i for fear of trust forget to say
the perfect ceremony of loves rite
and in mine own loves strength seem to decay
oercharged with burden of mine own loves might
o let my books be then the eloquence
and dumb presagers of my speaking breast
who plead for love and look for recompense
more than that tongue that more hath more expressd
o learn to read what silent love hath writ
to hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit


mine eye hath playd the painter and hath stelld
thy beautys form in table of my heart
my body is the frame wherein tis held
and perspective it is the painters art
for through the painter must you see his skill
to find where your true image pictured lies
which in my bosoms shop is hanging still
that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes
now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done
mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me
are windows to my breast where through the sun
delights to peep to gaze therein on thee
yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art
they draw but what they see know not the heart


let those who are in favour with their stars
of public honour and proud titles boast
whilst i whom fortune of such triumph bars
unlookd for joy in that i honour most
great princes favourites their fair leaves spread
but as the marigold at the suns eye
and in themselves their pride lies buried
for at a frown they in their glory die
the painful warrior famoused for fight
after a thousand victories once foild
is from the book of honour razed quite
and all the rest forgot for which he toild
then happy i that love and am beloved
where i may not remove nor be removed


lord of my love to whom in vassalage
thy merit hath my duty strongly knit
to thee i send this written embassage
to witness duty not to show my wit
duty so great which wit so poor as mine
may make seem bare in wanting words to show it
but that i hope some good conceit of thine
in thy souls thought all naked will bestow it
till whatsoever star that guides my moving
points on me graciously with fair aspect
and puts apparel on my tatterd loving
to show me worthy of thy sweet respect
then may i dare to boast how i do love thee
till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me


weary with toil i haste me to my bed
the dear repose for limbs with travel tired
but then begins a journey in my head
to work my mind when bodys works expired
for then my thoughts from far where i abide
intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee
and keep my drooping eyelids open wide
looking on darkness which the blind do see
save that my souls imaginary sight
presents thy shadow to my sightless view
which like a jewel hung in ghastly night
makes black night beauteous and her old face new
lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind
for thee and for myself no quiet find


how can i then return in happy plight
that am debarrd the benefit of rest
when days oppression is not eased by night
but day by night and night by day oppressd
and each though enemies to eithers reign
do in consent shake hands to torture me
the one by toil the other to complain
how far i toil still farther off from thee
i tell the day to please them thou art bright
and dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven
so flatter i the swart complexiond night
when sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even
but day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
and night doth nightly make griefs strength seem stronger


when in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes
i all alone beweep my outcast state
and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries
and look upon myself and curse my fate
wishing me like to one more rich in hope
featured like him like him with friends possessd
desiring this mans art and that mans scope
with what i most enjoy contented least
yet in these thoughts myself almost despising
haply i think on thee and then my state
like to the lark at break of day arising
from sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate
for thy sweet love rememberd such wealth brings
that then i scorn to change my state with kings


when to the sessions of sweet silent thought
i summon up remembrance of things past
i sigh the lack of many a thing i sought
and with old woes new wail my dear times waste
then can i drown an eye unused to flow
for precious friends hid in deaths dateless night
and weep afresh loves long since cancelld woe
and moan the expense of many a vanishd sight
then can i grieve at grievances foregone
and heavily from woe to woe tell oer
the sad account of fore bemoaned moan
which i new pay as if not paid before
but if the while i think on thee dear friend
all losses are restored and sorrows end


thy bosom is endeared with all hearts
which i by lacking have supposed dead
and there reigns love and all loves loving parts
and all those friends which i thought buried
how many a holy and obsequious tear
hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye
as interest of the dead which now appear
but things removed that hidden in thee lie
thou art the grave where buried love doth live
hung with the trophies of my lovers gone
who all their parts of me to thee did give
that due of many now is thine alone
their images i loved i view in thee
and thou all they hast all the all of me


if thou survive my well contented day
when that churl death my bones with dust shall cover
and shalt by fortune once more re survey
these poor rude lines of thy deceased lover
compare them with the bettering of the time
and though they be outstrippd by every pen
reserve them for my love not for their rhyme
exceeded by the height of happier men
o then vouchsafe me but this loving thought
had my friends muse grown with this growing age
a dearer birth than this his love had brought
to march in ranks of better equipage
but since he died and poets better prove
theirs for their style ill read his for his love


full many a glorious morning have i seen
flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye
kissing with golden face the meadows green
gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
anon permit the basest clouds to ride
with ugly rack on his celestial face
and from the forlorn world his visage hide
stealing unseen to west with this disgrace
even so my sun one early morn did shine
with all triumphant splendor on my brow
but out alack he was but one hour mine
the region cloud hath maskd him from me now
yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth
suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth


why didst thou promise such a beauteous day
and make me travel forth without my cloak
to let base clouds oertake me in my way
hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke
tis not enough that through the cloud thou break
to dry the rain on my storm beaten face
for no man well of such a salve can speak
that heals the wound and cures not the disgrace
nor can thy shame give physic to my grief
though thou repent yet i have still the loss
the offenders sorrow lends but weak relief
to him that bears the strong offences cross
ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds
and they are rich and ransom all ill deeds


no more be grieved at that which thou hast done
roses have thorns and silver fountains mud
clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun
and loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud
all men make faults and even i in this
authorizing thy trespass with compare
myself corrupting salving thy amiss
excusing thy sins more than thy sins are
for to thy sensual fault i bring in sense
thy adverse party is thy advocate
and gainst myself a lawful plea commence
such civil war is in my love and hate
that i an accessary needs must be
to that sweet thief which sourly robs from me


let me confess that we two must be twain
although our undivided loves are one
so shall those blots that do with me remain
without thy help by me be borne alone
in our two loves there is but one respect
though in our lives a separable spite
which though it alter not loves sole effect
yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight
i may not evermore acknowledge thee
lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame
nor thou with public kindness honour me
unless thou take that honour from thy name
but do not so i love thee in such sort
as thou being mine mine is thy good report


as a decrepit father takes delight
to see his active child do deeds of youth
so i made lame by fortunes dearest spite
take all my comfort of thy worth and truth
for whether beauty birth or wealth or wit
or any of these all or all or more
entitled in thy parts do crowned sit
i make my love engrafted to this store
so then i am not lame poor nor despised
whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
that i in thy abundance am sufficed
and by a part of all thy glory live
look what is best that best i wish in thee
this wish i have then ten times happy me


how can my muse want subject to invent
while thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse
thine own sweet argument too excellent
for every vulgar paper to rehearse
o give thyself the thanks if aught in me
worthy perusal stand against thy sight
for whos so dumb that cannot write to thee
when thou thyself dost give invention light
be thou the tenth muse ten times more in worth
than those old nine which rhymers invocate
and he that calls on thee let him bring forth
eternal numbers to outlive long date
if my slight muse do please these curious days
the pain be mine but thine shall be the praise


o how thy worth with manners may i sing
when thou art all the better part of me
what can mine own praise to mine own self bring
and what is t but mine own when i praise thee
even for this let us divided live
and our dear love lose name of single one
that by this separation i may give
that due to thee which thou deservest alone
o absence what a torment wouldst thou prove
were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
to entertain the time with thoughts of love
which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive
and that thou teachest how to make one twain
by praising him here who doth hence remain


take all my loves my love yea take them all
what hast thou then more than thou hadst before
no love my love that thou mayst true love call
all mine was thine before thou hadst this more
then if for my love thou my love receivest
i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest
but yet be blamed if thou thyself deceivest
by wilful taste of what thyself refusest
i do forgive thy robbery gentle thief
although thou steal thee all my poverty
and yet love knows it is a greater grief
to bear loves wrong than hates known injury
lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows
kill me with spites yet we must not be foes


those petty wrongs that liberty commits
when i am sometime absent from thy heart
thy beauty and thy years full well befits
for still temptation follows where thou art
gentle thou art and therefore to be won
beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed
and when a woman woos what womans son
will sourly leave her till she have prevailed
ay me but yet thou mightest my seat forbear
and chide try beauty and thy straying youth
who lead thee in their riot even there
where thou art forced to break a twofold truth
hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee
thine by thy beauty being false to me


that thou hast her it is not all my grief
and yet it may be said i loved her dearly
that she hath thee is of my wailing chief
a loss in love that touches me more nearly
loving offenders thus i will excuse ye
thou dost love her because thou knowst i love her
and for my sake even so doth she abuse me
suffering my friend for my sake to approve her
if i lose thee my loss is my loves gain
and losing her my friend hath found that loss
both find each other and i lose both twain
and both for my sake lay on me this cross
but heres the joy my friend and i are one
sweet flattery then she loves but me alone


when most i wink then do mine eyes best see
for all the day they view things unrespected
but when i sleep in dreams they look on thee
and darkly bright are bright in dark directed
then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright
how would thy shadows form form happy show
to the clear day with thy much clearer light
when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so
how would i say mine eyes be blessed made
by looking on thee in the living day
when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay
all days are nights to see till i see thee
and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me


if the dull substance of my flesh were thought
injurious distance should not stop my way
for then despite of space i would be brought
from limits far remote where thou dost stay
no matter then although my foot did stand
upon the farthest earth removed from thee
for nimble thought can jump both sea and land
as soon as think the place where he would be
but ah thought kills me that i am not thought
to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone
but that so much of earth and water wrought
i must attend times leisure with my moan
receiving nought by elements so slow
but heavy tears badges of eithers woe


the other two slight air and purging fire
are both with thee wherever i abide
the first my thought the other my desire
these present absent with swift motion slide
for when these quicker elements are gone
in tender embassy of love to thee
my life being made of four with two alone
sinks down to death oppressd with melancholy
until lifes composition be recured
by those swift messengers returnd from thee
who even but now come back again assured
of thy fair health recounting it to me
this told i joy but then no longer glad
i send them back again and straight grow sad


mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
how to divide the conquest of thy sight
mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar
my heart mine eye the freedom of that right
my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie
a closet never pierced with crystal eyes
but the defendant doth that plea deny
and says in him thy fair appearance lies
to cide this title is impanneled
a quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart
and by their verdict is determined
the clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part
as thus mine eyes due is thy outward part
and my hearts right thy inward love of heart


betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took
and each doth good turns now unto the other
when that mine eye is famishd for a look
or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother
with my loves picture then my eye doth feast
and to the painted banquet bids my heart
another time mine eye is my hearts guest
and in his thoughts of love doth share a part
so either by thy picture or my love
thyself away art resent still with me
for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move
and i am still with them and they with thee
or if they sleep thy picture in my sight
awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight


how careful was i when i took my way
each trifle under truest bars to thrust
that to my use it might unused stay
from hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust
but thou to whom my jewels trifles are
most worthy of comfort now my greatest grief
thou best of dearest and mine only care
art left the prey of every vulgar thief
thee have i not lockd up in any chest
save where thou art not though i feel thou art
within the gentle closure of my breast
from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part
and even thence thou wilt be stoln i fear
for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear


against that time if ever that time come
when i shall see thee frown on my defects
when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum
calld to that audit by advised respects
against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye
when love converted from the thing it was
shall reasons find of settled gravity
against that time do i ensconce me here
within the knowledge of mine own desert
and this my hand against myself uprear
to guard the lawful reasons on thy part
to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws
since why to love i can allege no cause


how heavy do i journey on the way
when what i seek my weary travels end
doth teach that ease and that repose to say
thus far the miles are measured from thy friend
the beast that bears me tired with my woe
plods dully on to bear that weight in me
as if by some instinct the wretch did know
his rider loved not speed being made from thee
the bloody spur cannot provoke him on
that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide
which heavily he answers with a groan
more sharp to me than spurring to his side
for that same groan doth put this in my mind
my grief lies onward and my joy behind


thus can my love excuse the slow offence
of my dull bearer when from thee i speed
from where thou art why should i haste me thence
till i return of posting is no need
o what excuse will my poor beast then find
when swift extremity can seem but slow
then should i spur though mounted on the wind
in winged speed no motion shall i know
then can no horse with my desire keep pace
therefore desire of perfectst love being made
shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race
but love for love thus shall excuse my jade
since from thee going he went wilful slow
towards thee ill run and give him leave to go


so am i as the rich whose blessed key
can bring him to his sweet up locked treasure
the which he will not every hour survey
for blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure
therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare
since seldom coming in the long year set
like stones of worth they thinly placed are
or captain jewels in the carcanet
so is the time that keeps you as my chest
or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide
to make some special instant special blest
by new unfolding his imprisond pride
blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope
being had to triumph being lackd to hope


what is your substance whereof are you made
that millions of strange shadows on you tend
since every one hath every one one shade
and you but one can every shadow lend
describe adonis and the counterfeit
is poorly imitated after you
on helens cheek all art of beauty set
and you in grecian tires are painted new
speak of the spring and foison of the year
the one doth shadow of your beauty show
the other as your bounty doth appear
and you in every blessed shape we know
in all external grace you have some part
but you like none none you for constant heart


o how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
by that sweet ornament which truth doth give
the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem
for that sweet odour which doth in it live
the canker blooms have full as deep a dye
as the perfumed tincture of the roses
hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
when summers breath their masked buds discloses
but for their virtue only is their show
they live unwood and unrespected fade
die to themselves sweet roses do not so
of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made
and so of you beauteous and lovely youth
when that shall fade my verse distills your truth


not marble nor the gilded monuments
of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme
but you shall shine more bright in these contents
than unswept stone besmeard with sluttish time
when wasteful war shall statues overturn
and broils root out the work of masonry
nor mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn
the living record of your memory
gainst death and all oblivious enmity
shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room
even in the eyes of all posterity
that wear this world out to the ending doom
so till the judgment that yourself arise
you live in this and dwell in lovers eyes


sweet love renew thy force be it not said
thy edge should blunter be than appetite
which but to day by feeding is allayd
to morrow sharpend in his former might
so love be thou although to day thou fill
thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness
to morrow see again and do not kill
the spirit of love with a perpetual dullness
let this sad interim like the ocean be
which parts the shore where two contracted new
come daily to the banks that when they see
return of love more blest may be the view
else call it winter which being full of care
makes summers welcome thrice more wishd more rare


being your slave what should i do but tend
upon the hours and times of your desire
i have no precious time at all to spend
nor services to do till you require
nor dare i chide the world without end hour
whilst i my sovereign watch the clock for you
nor think the bitterness of absence sour
when you have bid your servant once adieu
nor dare i question with my jealous thought
where you may be or your affairs suppose
but like a sad slave stay and think of nought
save where you are how happy you make those
so true a fool is love that in your will
though you do any thing he thinks no ill


that god forbid that made me first your slave
i should in thought control your times of pleasure
or at your hand the account of hours to crave
being your vassal bound to stay your leisure
o let me suffer being at your beck
the imprisond absence of your liberty
and patience tame to sufferance bide each cheque
without accusing you of injury
be where you list your charter is so strong
that you yourself may privilege your time
to what you will to you it doth belong
yourself to pardon of self doing crime
i am to wait though waiting so be hell
not blame your pleasure be it ill or well


if there be nothing new but that which is
hath been before how are our brains beguiled
which labouring for invention bear amiss
the second burden of a former child
o that record could with a backward look
even of five hundred courses of the sun
show me your image in some antique book
since mind at first in character was done
that i might see what the old world could say
to this composed wonder of your frame
whether we are mended or whether better they
or whether revolution be the same
o sure i am the wits of former days
to subjects worse have given admiring praise


like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
so do our minutes hasten to their end
each changing place with that which goes before
in sequent toil all forwards do contend
nativity once in the main of light
crawls to maturity wherewith being crownd
crooked elipses gainst his glory fight
and time that gave doth now his gift confound
time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
and delves the parallels in beautys brow
feeds on the rarities of natures truth
and nothing stands but for his scythe to mow
and yet to times in hope my verse shall stand
praising thy worth despite his cruel hand


is it thy will thy image should keep open
my heavy eyelids to the weary night
dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken
while shadows like to thee do mock my sight
is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee
so far from home into my deeds to pry
to find out shames and idle hours in me
the scope and tenor of thy jealousy
o no thy love though much is not so great
it is my love that keeps mine eye awake
mine own true love that doth my rest defeat
to play the watchman ever for thy sake
for thee watch i whilst thou dost wake elsewhere
from me far off with others all too near


sin of self love possesseth all mine eye
and all my soul and all my every part
and for this sin there is no remedy
it is so grounded inward in my heart
methinks no face so gracious is as mine
no shape so true no truth of such account
and for myself mine own worth do define
as i all other in all worths surmount
but when my glass shows me myself indeed
beated and choppd with tannd antiquity
mine own self love quite contrary i read
self so self loving were iniquity
tis thee myself that for myself i praise
painting my age with beauty of thy days


against my love shall be as i am now
with times injurious hand crushd and oer worn
when hours have draind his blood and filld his brow
with lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn
hath travelld on to ages steepy night
and all those beauties whereof now hes king
are vanishing or vanishd out of sight
stealing away the treasure of his spring
for such a time do i now fortify
against confounding ages cruel knife
that he shall never cut from memory
my sweet loves beauty though my lovers life
his beauty shall in these black lines be seen
and they shall live and he in them still green


when i have seen by times fell hand defaced
the rich proud cost of outworn buried age
when sometime lofty towers i see down razed
and brass eternal slave to mortal rage
when i have seen the hungry ocean gain
advantage on the kingdom of the shore
and the firm soil win of the watery main
increasing store with loss and loss with store
when i have seen such interchange of state
or state itself confounded to decay
ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate
that time will come and take my love away
this thought is as a death which cannot choose
but weep to have that which it fears to lose


since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea
but sad mortality oer sways their power
how with this rage shall beauty hold a plea
whose action is no stronger than a flower
o how shall summers honey breath hold out
against the wreckful siege of battering days
when rocks impregnable are not so stout
nor gates of steel so strong but time decays
o fearful meditation where alack
shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid
or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back
or who his spoil of beauty can forbid
o none unless this miracle have might
that in black ink my love may still shine bright


tired with all these for restful death i cry
as to behold desert a beggar born
and needy nothing trimmd in jollity
and purest faith unhappily forsworn
and guilded honour shamefully misplaced
and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted
and right perfection wrongfully disgraced
and strength by limping sway disabled
and art made tongue tied by authority
and folly doctor like controlling skill
and simple truth miscalld simplicity
and captive good attending captain ill
tired with all these from these would i be gone
save that to die i leave my love alone


ah wherefore with infection should he live
and with his presence grace impiety
that sin by him advantage should achieve
and lace itself with his society
why should false painting imitate his cheek
and steal dead seeing of his living hue
why should poor beauty indirectly seek
roses of shadow since his rose is true
why should he live now nature bankrupt is
beggard of blood to blush through lively veins
for she hath no exchequer now but his
and proud of many lives upon his gains
o him she stores to show what wealth she had
in days long since before these last so bad


thus is his cheek the map of days outworn
when beauty lived and died as flowers do now
before the bastard signs of fair were born
or durst inhabit on a living brow
before the golden tresses of the dead
the right of sepulchres were shorn away
to live a second life on second head
ere beautys dead fleece made another gay
in him those holy antique hours are seen
without all ornament itself and true
making no summer of anothers green
robbing no old to dress his beauty new
and him as for a map doth nature store
to show false art what beauty was of yore


those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view
want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend
all tongues the voice of souls give thee that due
uttering bare truth even so as foes commend
thy outward thus with outward praise is crownd
but those same tongues that give thee so thine own
in other accents do this praise confound
by seeing farther than the eye hath shown
they look into the beauty of thy mind
and that in guess they measure by thy deeds
then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind
to thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds
but why thy odour matcheth not thy show
the solve is this that thou dost common grow


that thou art blamed shall not be thy defect
for slanders mark was ever yet the fair
the ornament of beauty is suspect
a crow that flies in heavens sweetest air
so thou be good slander doth but approve
thy worth the greater being wood of time
for canker vice the sweetest buds doth love
and thou presentst a pure unstained prime
thou hast passd by the ambush of young days
either not assaild or victor being charged
yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise
to tie up envy evermore enlarged
if some suspect of ill maskd not thy show
then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe


no longer mourn for me when i am dead
then you shall hear the surly sullen bell
give warning to the world that i am fled
from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell
nay if you read this line remember not
the hand that writ it for i love you so
that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
if thinking on me then should make you woe
o if i say you look upon this verse
when i perhaps compounded am with clay
do not so much as my poor name rehearse
but let your love even with my life decay
lest the wise world should look into your moan
and mock you with me after i am gone


o lest the world should task you to recite
what merit lived in me that you should love
after my death dear love forget me quite
for you in me can nothing worthy prove
unless you would devise some virtuous lie
to do more for me than mine own desert
and hang more praise upon deceased i
than niggard truth would willingly impart
o lest your true love may seem false in this
that you for love speak well of me untrue
my name be buried where my body is
and live no more to shame nor me nor you
for i am shamed by that which i bring forth
and so should you to love things nothing worth


that time of year thou mayst in me behold
when yellow leaves or none or few do hang
upon those boughs which shake against the cold
bare ruind choirs where late the sweet birds sang
in me thou seest the twilight of such day
as after sunset fadeth in the west
which by and by black night doth take away
deaths second self that seals up all in rest
in me thou seest the glowing of such fire
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie
as the death bed whereon it must expire
consumed with that which it was nourishd by
this thou perceivest which makes thy love more strong
to love that well which thou must leave ere long


but be contented when that fell arrest
without all bail shall carry me away
my life hath in this line some interest
which for memorial still with thee shall stay
when thou reviewest this thou dost review
the very part was consecrate to thee
the earth can have but earth which is his due
my spirit is thine the better part of me
so then thou hast but lost the dregs of life
the prey of worms my body being dead
the coward conquest of a wretchs knife
too base of thee to be remembered
the worth of that is that which it contains
and that is this and this with thee remains


so are you to my thoughts as food to life
or as sweet seasond showers are to the ground
and for the peace of you i hold such strife
as twixt a miser and his wealth is found
now proud as an enjoyer and anon
doubting the filching age will steal his treasure
now counting best to be with you alone
then betterd that the world may see my pleasure
sometime all full with feasting on your sight
and by and by clean starved for a look
possessing or pursuing no delight
save what is had or must from you be took
thus do i pine and surfeit day by day
or gluttoning on all or all away


why is my verse so barren of new pride
so far from variation or quick change
why with the time do i not glance aside
to new found methods and to compounds strange
why write i still all one ever the same
and keep invention in a noted weed
that every word doth almost tell my name
showing their birth and where they did proceed
o know sweet love i always write of you
and you and love are still my argument
so all my best is dressing old words new
spending again what is already spent
for as the sun is daily new and old
so is my love still telling what is told


thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear
thy dial how thy precious minutes waste
the vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear
and of this book this learning mayst thou taste
the wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
of mouthed graves will give thee memory
thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know
times thievish progress to eternity
look what thy memory can not contain
commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find
those children nursed deliverd from thy brain
to take a new acquaintance of thy mind
these offices so oft as thou wilt look
shall profit thee and much enrich thy book


so oft have i invoked thee for my muse
and found such fair assistance in my verse
as every alien pen hath got my use
and under thee their poesy disperse
thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
and heavy ignorance aloft to fly
have added feathers to the learneds wing
and given grace a double majesty
yet be most proud of that which i compile
whose influence is thine and born of thee
in others works thou dost but mend the style
and arts with thy sweet graces graced be
but thou art all my art and dost advance
as high as learning my rude ignorance


whilst i alone did call upon thy aid
my verse alone had all thy gentle grace
but now my gracious numbers are decayd
and my sick muse doth give another place
i grant sweet love thy lovely argument
deserves the travail of a worthier pen
yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
he robs thee of and pays it thee again
he lends thee virtue and he stole that word
from thy behavior beauty doth he give
and found it in thy cheek he can afford
no praise to thee but what in thee doth live
then thank him not for that which he doth say
since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay


o how i faint when i of you do write
knowing a better spirit doth use your name
and in the praise thereof spends all his might
to make me tongue tied speaking of your fame
but since your worth wide as the ocean is
the humble as the proudest sail doth bear
my saucy bark inferior far to his
on your broad main doth wilfully appear
your shallowest help will hold me up afloat
whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride
or being wreckd i am a worthless boat
he of tall building and of goodly pride
then if he thrive and i be cast away
the worst was this my love was my decay


or i shall live your epitaph to make
or you survive when i in earth am rotten
from hence your memory death cannot take
although in me each part will be forgotten
your name from hence immortal life shall have
though i once gone to all the world must die
the earth can yield me but a common grave
when you entombed in mens eyes shall lie
your monument shall be my gentle verse
which eyes not yet created shall oer read
and tongues to be your being shall rehearse
when all the breathers of this world are dead
you still shall live such virtue hath my pen
where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men


i grant thou wert not married to my muse
and therefore mayst without attaint oerlook
the dedicated words which writers use
of their fair subject blessing every book
thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue
finding thy worth a limit past my praise
and therefore art enforced to seek anew
some fresher stamp of the time bettering days
and do so love yet when they have devised
what strained touches rhetoric can lend
thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
in true plain words by thy true telling friend
and their gross painting might be better used
where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused


i never saw that you did painting need
and therefore to your fair no painting set
i found or thought i found you did exceed
the barren tender of a poets debt
and therefore have i slept in your report
that you yourself being extant well might show
how far a modern quill doth come too short
speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow
this silence for my sin you did impute
which shall be most my glory being dumb
for i impair not beauty being mute
when others would give life and bring a tomb
there lives more life in one of your fair eyes
than both your poets can in praise devise


who is it that says most which can say more
than this rich praise that you alone are you
in whose confine immured is the store
which should example where your equal grew
lean penury within that pen doth dwell
that to his subject lends not some small glory
but he that writes of you if he can tell
that you are you so dignifies his story
let him but copy what in you is writ
not making worse what nature made so clear
and such a counterpart shall fame his wit
making his style admired every where
you to your beauteous blessings add a curse
being fond on praise which makes your praises worse


my tongue tied muse in manners holds her still
while comments of your praise richly compiled
reserve their character with golden quill
and precious phrase by all the muses filed
i think good thoughts whilst other write good words
and like unletterd clerk still cry amen
to every hymn that able spirit affords
in polishd form of well refined pen
hearing you praised i say tis so tis true
and to the most of praise add something more
but that is in my thought whose love to you
though words come hindmost holds his rank before
then others for the breath of words respect
me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect


was it the proud full sail of his great verse
bound for the prize of all too precious you
that did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse
making their tomb the womb wherein they grew
was it his spirit by spirits taught to write
above a mortal pitch that struck me dead
no neither he nor his compeers by night
giving him aid my verse astonished
he nor that affable familiar ghost
which nightly gulls him with intelligence
as victors of my silence cannot boast
i was not sick of any fear from thence
but when your countenance filld up his line
then lackd i matter that enfeebled mine


farewell thou art too dear for my possessing
and like enough thou knowst thy estimate
the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing
my bonds in thee are all determinate
for how do i hold thee but by thy granting
and for that riches where is my deserving
the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting
and so my patent back again is swerving
thyself thou gavest thy own worth then not knowing
or me to whom thou gavest it else mistaking
so thy great gift upon misprision growing
comes home again on better judgment making
thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter
in sleep a king but waking no such matter


when thou shalt be disposed to set me light
and place my merit in the eye of scorn
upon thy side against myself ill fight
and prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn
with mine own weakness being best acquainted
upon thy part i can set down a story
of faults conceald wherein i am attainted
that thou in losing me shalt win much glory
and i by this will be a gainer too
for bending all my loving thoughts on thee
the injuries that to myself i do
doing thee vantage double vantage me
such is my love to thee i so belong
that for thy right myself will bear all wrong


say that thou didst forsake me for some fault
and i will comment upon that offence
speak of my lameness and i straight will halt
against thy reasons making no defence
thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill
to set a form upon desired change
as ill myself disgrace knowing thy will
i will acquaintance strangle and look strange
be absent from thy walks and in my tongue
thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell
lest i too much profane should do it wrong
and haply of our old acquaintance tell
for thee against myself ill vow debate
for i must neer love him whom thou dost hate


then hate me when thou wilt if ever now
now while the world is bent my deeds to cross
join with the spite of fortune make me bow
and do not drop in for an after loss
ah do not when my heart hath scoped this sorrow
come in the rearward of a conquerd woe
give not a windy night a rainy morrow
to linger out a purposed overthrow
if thou wilt leave me do not leave me last
when other petty griefs have done their spite
but in the onset come so shall i taste
at first the very worst of fortunes might
and other strains of woe which now seem woe
compared with loss of thee will not seem so


some glory in their birth some in their skill
some in their wealth some in their bodies force
some in their garments though new fangled ill
some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse
and every humour hath his adjunct pleasure
wherein it finds a joy above the rest
but these particulars are not my measure
all these i better in one general best
thy love is better than high birth to me
richer than wealth prouder than garments cost
of more delight than hawks or horses be
and having thee of all mens pride i boast
wretched in this alone that thou mayst take
all this away and me most wretched make


but do thy worst to steal thyself away
for term of life thou art assured mine
and life no longer than thy love will stay
for it depends upon that love of thine
then need i not to fear the worst of wrongs
when in the least of them my life hath end
i see a better state to me belongs
than that which on thy humour doth depend
thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind
since that my life on thy revolt doth lie
o what a happy title do i find
happy to have thy love happy to die
but whats so blessed fair that fears no blot
thou mayst be false and yet i know it not


so shall i live supposing thou art true
like a deceived husband so loves face
may still seem love to me though alterd new
thy looks with me thy heart in other place
for there can live no hatred in thine eye
therefore in that i cannot know thy change
in manys looks the false hearts history
is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange
but heaven in thy creation did decree
that in thy face sweet love should ever dwell
whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be
thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell
how like eves apple doth thy beauty grow
if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show


they that have power to hurt and will do none
that do not do the thing they most do show
who moving others are themselves as stone
unmoved cold and to temptation slow
they rightly do inherit heavens graces
and husband natures riches from expense
they are the lords and owners of their faces
others but stewards of their excellence
the summers flower is to the summer sweet
though to itself it only live and die
but if that flower with base infection meet
the basest weed outbraves his dignity
for sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds
lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds


how sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
which like a canker in the fragrant rose
doth spot the beauty of thy budding name
o in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose
that tongue that tells the story of thy days
making lascivious comments on thy sport
cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise
naming thy name blesses an ill report
o what a mansion have those vices got
which for their habitation chose out thee
where beautys veil doth cover every blot
and all things turn to fair that eyes can see
take heed dear heart of this large privilege
the hardest knife ill used doth lose his edge


some say thy fault is youth some wantonness
some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport
both grace and faults are loved of more and less
thou makest faults graces that to thee resort
as on the finger of a throned queen
the basest jewel will be well esteemd
so are those errors that in thee are seen
to truths translated and for true things deemd
how many lambs might the stem wolf betray
if like a lamb he could his looks translate
how many gazers mightst thou lead away
if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state
but do not so i love thee in such sort
as thou being mine mine is thy good report


how like a winter hath my absence been
from thee the pleasure of the fleeting year
what freezings have i felt what dark days seen
what old decembers bareness every where
and yet this time removed was summers time
the teeming autumn big with rich increase
bearing the wanton burden of the prime
like widowd wombs after their lords decease
yet this abundant issue seemd to me
but hope of orphans and unfatherd fruit
for summer and his pleasures wait on thee
and thou away the very birds are mute
or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer
that leaves look pale dreading the winters near


from you have i been absent in the spring
when proud pied april dressd in all his trim
hath put a spirit of youth in every thing
that heavy saturn laughd and leapd with him
yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
of different flowers in odour and in hue
could make me any summers story tell
or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew
nor did i wonder at the lilys white
nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose
they were but sweet but figures of delight
drawn after you you pattern of all those
yet seemd it winter still and you away
as with your shadow i with these did play


the forward violet thus did i chide
sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells
if not from my loves breath the purple pride
which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
in my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyed
the lily i condemned for thy hand
and buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair
the roses fearfully on thorns did stand
one blushing shame another white despair
a third nor red nor white had stoln of both
and to his robbery had annexd thy breath
but for his theft in pride of all his growth
a vengeful canker eat him up to death
more flowers i noted yet i none could see
but sweet or colour it had stoln from thee


where art thou muse that thou forgetst so long
to speak of that which gives thee all thy might
spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song
darkening thy power to lend base subjects light
return forgetful muse and straight redeem
in gentle numbers time so idly spent
sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
and gives thy pen both skill and argument
rise resty muse my loves sweet face survey
if time have any wrinkle graven there
if any be a satire to decay
and make times spoils despised every where
give my love fame faster than time wastes life
so thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife


o truant muse what shall be thy amends
for thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed
both truth and beauty on my love depends
so dost thou too and therein dignified
make answer muse wilt thou not haply say
truth needs no colour with his colour fixd
beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay
but best is best if never intermixd
because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb
excuse not silence so fort lies in thee
to make him much outlive a gilded tomb
and to be praised of ages yet to be
then do thy office muse i teach thee how
to make him seem long hence as he shows now


my love is strengthend though more weak in seeming
i love not less though less the show appear
that love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
the owners tongue doth publish every where
our love was new and then but in the spring
when i was wont to greet it with my lays
as philomel in summers front doth sing
and stops her pipe in growth of riper days
not that the summer is less pleasant now
than when her mournful hymns did hush the night
but that wild music burthens every bough
and sweets grown common lose their dear delight
therefore like her i sometime hold my tongue
because i would not dull you with my song


alack what poverty my muse brings forth
that having such a scope to show her pride
the argument all bare is of more worth
than when it hath my added praise beside
o blame me not if i no more can write
look in your glass and there appears a face
that over goes my blunt invention quite
dulling my lines and doing me disgrace
were it not sinful then striving to mend
to mar the subject that before was well
for to no other pass my verses tend
than of your graces and your gifts to tell
and more much more than in my verse can sit
your own glass shows you when you look in it


to me fair friend you never can be old
for as you were when first your eye i eyed
such seems your beauty still three winters cold
have from the forests shook three summers pride
three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turnd
in process of the seasons have i seen
three april perfumes in three hot junes burnd
since first i saw you fresh which yet are green
ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand
steal from his figure and no pace perceived
so your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand
hath motion and mine eye may be deceived
for fear of which hear this thou age unbred
ere you were born was beautys summer dead


let not my love be calld idolatry
nor my beloved as an idol show
since all alike my songs and praises be
to one of one still such and ever so
kind is my love to day to morrow kind
still constant in a wondrous excellence
therefore my verse to constancy confined
one thing expressing leaves out difference
fair kind and true is all my argument
fair kind and true varying to other words
and in this change is my invention spent
three themes in one which wondrous scope affords
fair kind and true have often lived alone
which three till now never kept seat in one


when in the chronicle of wasted time
i see descriptions of the fairest wights
and beauty making beautiful old rhyme
in praise of ladies dead and lovely knights
then in the blazon of sweet beautys best
of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow
i see their antique pen would have expressd
even such a beauty as you master now
so all their praises are but prophecies
of this our time all you prefiguring
and for they lookd but with divining eyes
they had not skill enough your worth to sing
for we which now behold these present days
had eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise


not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul
of the wide world dreaming on things to come
can yet the lease of my true love control
supposed as forfeit to a confined doom
the mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
and the sad augurs mock their own presage
incertainties now crown themselves assured
and peace proclaims olives of endless age
now with the drops of this most balmy time
my love looks fresh and death to me subscribes
since spite of him ill live in this poor rhyme
while he insults oer dull and speechless tribes
and thou in this shalt find thy monument
when tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent


whats in the brain that ink may character
which hath not figured to thee my true spirit
whats new to speak what new to register
that may express my love or thy dear merit
nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine
i must each day say oer the very same
counting no old thing old thou mine i thine
even as when first i hallowd thy fair name
so that eternal love in loves fresh case
weighs not the dust and injury of age
nor gives to necessary wrinkles place
but makes antiquity for aye his page
finding the first conceit of love there bred
where time and outward form would show it dead


o never say that i was false of heart
though absence seemd my flame to qualify
as easy might i from myself depart
as from my soul which in thy breast doth lie
that is my home of love if i have ranged
like him that travels i return again
just to the time not with the time exchanged
so that myself bring water for my stain
never believe though in my nature reignd
all frailties that besiege all kinds of blood
that it could so preposterously be staind
to leave for nothing all thy sum of good
for nothing this wide universe i call
save thou my rose in it thou art my all


alas tis true i have gone here and there
and made myself a motley to the view
gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear
made old offences of affections new
most true it is that i have lookd on truth
askance and strangely but by all above
these blenches gave my heart another youth
and worse essays proved thee my best of love
now all is done have what shall have no end
mine appetite i never more will grind
on newer proof to try an older friend
a god in love to whom i am confined
then give me welcome next my heaven the best
even to thy pure and most most loving breast


o for my sake do you with fortune chide
the guilty goddess of my harmful deeds
that did not better for my life provide
than public means which public manners breeds
thence comes it that my name receives a brand
and almost thence my nature is subdued
to what it works in like the dyers hand
pity me then and wish i were renewd
whilst like a willing patient i will drink
potions of eisel gainst my strong infection
no bitterness that i will bitter think
nor double penance to correct correction
pity me then dear friend and i assure ye
even that your pity is enough to cure me


your love and pity doth the impression fill
which vulgar scandal stampd upon my brow
for what care i who calls me well or ill
so you oer green my bad my good allow
you are my all the world and i must strive
to know my shames and praises from your tongue
none else to me nor i to none alive
that my steeld sense or changes right or wrong
in so profound abysm i throw all care
of others voices that my adders sense
to critic and to flatterer stopped are
mark how with my neglect i do dispense
you are so strongly in my purpose bred
that all the world besides methinks are dead


since i left you mine eye is in my mind
and that which governs me to go about
doth part his function and is partly blind
seems seeing but effectually is out
for it no form delivers to the heart
of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch
of his quick objects hath the mind no part
nor his own vision holds what it doth catch
for if it see the rudest or gentlest sight
the most sweet favour or deformedst creature
the mountain or the sea the day or night
the crow or dove it shapes them to your feature
incapable of more replete with you
my most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue


or whether doth my mind being crownd with you
drink up the monarchs plague this flattery
or whether shall i say mine eye saith true
and that your love taught it this alchemy
to make of monsters and things indigest
such cherubins as your sweet self resemble
creating every bad a perfect best
as fast as objects to his beams assemble
otis the first tis flattery in my seeing
and my great mind most kingly drinks it up
mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing
and to his palate doth prepare the cup
if it be poisond tis the lesser sin
that mine eye loves it and doth first begin


those lines that i before have writ do lie
even those that said i could not love you dearer
yet then my judgment knew no reason why
my most full flame should afterwards burn clearer
but reckoning time whose milliond accidents
creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings
tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents
divert strong minds to the course of altering things
alas why fearing of times tyranny
might i not then say now i love you best
when i was certain oer incertainty
crowning the present doubting of the rest
love is a babe then might i not say so
to give full growth to that which still doth grow


let me not to the marriage of true minds
admit impediments love is not love
which alters when it alteration finds
or bends with the remover to remove
o no it is an ever fixed mark
that looks on tempests and is never shaken
it is the star to every wandering bark
whose worths unknown although his height be taken
loves not times fool though rosy lips and cheeks
within his bending sickles compass come
love alters not with his brief hours and weeks
but bears it out even to the edge of doom
if this be error and upon me proved
i never writ nor no man ever loved


accuse me thus that i have scanted all
wherein i should your great deserts repay
forgot upon your dearest love to call
whereto all bonds do tie me day by day
that i have frequent been with unknown minds
and given to time your own dear purchased right
that i have hoisted sail to all the winds
which should transport me farthest from your sight
book both my wilfulness and errors down
and on just proof surmise accumulate
bring me within the level of your frown
but shoot not at me in your wakend hate
since my appeal says i did strive to prove
the constancy and virtue of your love


like as to make our appetites more keen
with eager compounds we our palate urge
as to prevent our maladies unseen
we sicken to shun sickness when we purge
even so being tuff of your neer cloying sweetness
to bitter sauces did i frame my feeding
and sick of welfare found a kind of meetness
to be diseased ere that there was true needing
thus policy in love to anticipate
the ills that were not grew to faults assured
and brought to medicine a healthful state
which rank of goodness would by ill be cured
but thence i learn and find the lesson true
drugs poison him that so fell sick of you


what potions have i drunk of siren tears
distilld from limbecks foul as hell within
applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears
still losing when i saw myself to win
what wretched errors hath my heart committed
whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never
how have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
in the distraction of this madding fever
o benefit of ill now i find true
that better is by evil still made better
and ruind love when it is built anew
grows fairer than at first more strong far greater
so i return rebuked to my content
and gain by ill thrice more than i have spent


that you were once unkind befriends me now
and for that sorrow which i then did feel
needs must i under my transgression bow
unless my nerves were brass or hammerd steel
for if you were by my unkindness shaken
as i by yours youve passd a hell of time
and i a tyrant have no leisure taken
to weigh how once i suffered in your crime
o that our night of woe might have rememberd
my deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits
and soon to you as you to me then tenderd
the humble slave which wounded bosoms fits
but that your trespass now becomes a fee
mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me


tis better to be vile than vile esteemd
when not to be receives reproach of being
and the just pleasure lost which is so deemd
not by our feeling but by others seeing
for why should others false adulterate eyes
give salutation to my sportive blood
or on my frailties why are frailer spies
which in their wills count bad what i think good
no i am that i am and they that level
at my abuses reckon up their own
i may be straight though they themselves be bevel
by their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown
unless this general evil they maintain
all men are bad and in their badness reign


thy gift thy tables are within my brain
full characterd with lasting memory
which shall above that idle rank remain
beyond all date even to eternity
or at the least so long as brain and heart
have faculty by nature to subsist
till each to razed oblivion yield his part
of thee thy record never can be missd
that poor retention could not so much hold
nor need i tallies thy dear love to score
therefore to give them from me was i bold
to trust those tables that receive thee more
to keep an adjunct to remember thee
were to import forgetfulness in me


no time thou shalt not boast that i do change
thy pyramids built up with newer might
to me are nothing novel nothing strange
they are but dressings of a former sight
our dates are brief and therefore we admire
what thou dost foist upon us that is old
and rather make them born to our desire
than think that we before have heard them told
thy registers and thee i both defy
not wondering at the present nor the past
for thy records and what we see doth lie
made more or less by thy continual haste
this i do vow and this shall ever be
i will be true despite thy scythe and thee


if my dear love were but the child of state
it might for fortunes bastard be unfatherd
as subject to times love or to times hate
weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gatherd
no it was builded far from accident
it suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls
under the blow of thralled discontent
whereto the inviting time our fashion calls
it fears not policy that heretic
which works on leases of short numberd hours
but all alone stands hugely politic
that it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers
to this i witness call the fools of time
which die for goodness who have lived for crime


were t aught to me i bore the canopy
with my extern the outward honouring
or laid great bases for eternity
which prove more short than waste or ruining
have i not seen dwellers on form and favour
lose all and more by paying too much rent
for compound sweet forgoing simple savour
pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent
no let me be obsequious in thy heart
and take thou my oblation poor but free
which is not mixd with seconds knows no art
but mutual render only me for thee
hence thou subornd informer a true soul
when most impeachd stands least in thy control


o thou my lovely boy who in thy power
dost hold times fickle glass his sickle hour
who hast by waning grown and therein showst
thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst
if nature sovereign mistress over wrack
as thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back
she keeps thee to this purpose that her skill
may time disgrace and wretched minutes kill
yet fear her o thou minion of her pleasure
she may detain but not still keep her treasure
her audit though delayd answerd must be
and her quietus is to render thee


in the old age black was not counted fair
or if it were it bore not beautys name
but now is black beautys successive heir
and beauty slanderd with a bastard shame
for since each hand hath put on natures power
fairing the foul with arts false borrowd face
sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower
but is profaned if not lives in disgrace
therefore my mistress brows are raven black
her eyes so suited and they mourners seem
at such who not born fair no beauty lack
slandering creation with a false esteem
yet so they mourn becoming of their woe
that every tongue says beauty should look so


how oft when thou my music music playst
upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
with thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst
the wiry concord that mine ear confounds
do i envy those jacks that nimble leap
to kiss the tender inward of thy hand
whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap
at the woods boldness by thee blushing stand
to be so tickled they would change their state
and situation with those dancing chips
oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait
making dead wood more blest than living lips
since saucy jacks so happy are in this
give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss


the expense of spirit in a waste of shame
is lust in action and till action lust
is perjured murderous bloody full of blame
savage extreme rude cruel not to trust
enjoyd no sooner but despised straight
past reason hunted and no sooner had
past reason hated as a swallowd bait
on purpose laid to make the taker mad
mad in pursuit and in possession so
had having and in quest to have extreme
a bliss in proof and proved a very woe
before a joy proposed behind a dream
all this the world well knows yet none knows well
to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell


my mistress eyes are nothing like the sun
coral is far more red than her lips red
if snow be white why then her breasts are dun
if hairs be wires black wires grow on her head
i have seen roses damaskd red and white
but no such roses see i in her cheeks
and in some perfumes is there more delight
than in the breath that from my mistress reeks
i love to hear her speak yet well i know
that music hath a far more pleasing sound
i grant i never saw a goddess go
my mistress when she walks treads on the ground
and yet by heaven i think my love as rare
as any she belied with false compare


thou art as tyrannous so as thou art
as those whose beauties proudly make them cruel
for well thou knowst to my dear doting heart
thou art the fairest and most precious jewel
yet in good faith some say that thee behold
thy face hath not the power to make love groan
to say they err i dare not be so bold
although i swear it to myself alone
and to be sure that is not false i swear
a thousand groans but thinking on thy face
one on anothers neck do witness bear
thy black is fairest in my judgments place
in nothing art thou black save in thy deeds
and thence this slander as i think proceeds


thine eyes i love and they as pitying me
knowing thy heart torments me with disdain
have put on black and loving mourners be
looking with pretty ruth upon my pain
and truly not the morning sun of heaven
better becomes the grey cheeks of the east
nor that full star that ushers in the even
doth half that glory to the sober west
as those two mourning eyes become thy face
o let it then as well beseem thy heart
to mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace
and suit thy pity like in every part
then will i swear beauty herself is black
and all they foul that thy complexion lack


beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
for that deep wound it gives my friend and me
ist not enough to torture me alone
but slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be
me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken
and my next self thou harder hast engrossd
of him myself and thee i am forsaken
a torment thrice threefold thus to be crossd
prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward
but then my friends heart let my poor heart bail
whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard
thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol
and yet thou wilt for i being pent in thee
perforce am thine and all that is in me


so now i have confessd that he is thine
and i myself am mortgaged to thy will
myself ill forfeit so that other mine
thou wilt restore to be my comfort still
but thou wilt not nor he will not be free
for thou art covetous and he is kind
he learnd but surety like to write for me
under that bond that him as fast doth bind
the statute of thy beauty thou wilt take
thou usurer that putst forth all to use
and sue a friend came debtor for my sake
so him i lose through my unkind abuse
him have i lost thou hast both him and me
he pays the whole and yet am i not free


whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will
and will to boot and will in overplus
more than enough am i that vex thee still
to thy sweet will making addition thus
wilt thou whose will is large and spacious
not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine
shall will in others seem right gracious
and in my will no fair acceptance shine
the sea all water yet receives rain still
and in abundance addeth to his store
so thou being rich in will add to thy will
one will of mine to make thy large will more
let no unkind no fair beseechers kill
think all but one and me in that one will


if thy soul cheque thee that i come so near
swear to thy blind soul that i was thy will
and will thy soul knows is admitted there
thus far for love my love suit sweet fulfil
will will fulfil the treasure of thy love
ay fill it full with wills and my will one
in things of great receipt with ease we prove
among a number one is reckond none
then in the number let me pass untold
though in thy stores account i one must be
for nothing hold me so it please thee hold
that nothing me a something sweet to thee
make but my name thy love and love that still
and then thou lovest me for my name is will


thou blind fool love what dost thou to mine eyes
that they behold and see not what they see
they know what beauty is see where it lies
yet what the best is take the worst to be
if eyes corrupt by over partial looks
be anchord in the bay where all men ride
why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks
whereto the judgment of my heart is tied
why should my heart think that a several plot
which my heart knows the wide worlds common place
or mine eyes seeing this say this is not
to put fair truth upon so foul a face
in things right true my heart and eyes have erred
and to this false plague are they now transferrd


when my love swears that she is made of truth
i do believe her though i know she lies
that she might think me some untutord youth
unlearned in the worlds false subtleties
thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
although she knows my days are past the best
simply i credit her false speaking tongue
on both sides thus is simple truth suppressd
but wherefore says she not she is unjust
and wherefore say not i that i am old
o loves best habit is in seeming trust
and age in love loves not to have years told
therefore i lie with her and she with me
and in our faults by lies we flatterd be


o call not me to justify the wrong
that thy unkindness lays upon my heart
wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue
use power with power and slay me not by art
tell me thou lovest elsewhere but in my sight
dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside
what needst thou wound with cunning when thy might
is more than my oer pressd defense can bide
let me excuse thee ah my love well knows
her pretty looks have been mine enemies
and therefore from my face she turns my foes
that they elsewhere might dart their injuries
yet do not so but since i am near slain
kill me outright with looks and rid my pain


be wise as thou art cruel do not press
my tongue tied patience with too much disdain
lest sorrow lend me words and words express
the manner of my pity wanting pain
if i might teach thee wit better it were
though not to love yet love to tell me so
as testy sick men when their deaths be near
no news but health from their physicians know
for if i should despair i should grow mad
and in my madness might speak ill of thee
now this ill wresting world is grown so bad
mad slanderers by mad ears believed be
that i may not be so nor thou belied
bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide


in faith i do not love thee with mine eyes
for they in thee a thousand errors note
but tis my heart that loves what they despise
who in despite of view is pleased to dote
nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted
nor tender feeling to base touches prone
nor taste nor smell desire to be invited
to any sensual feast with thee alone
but my five wits nor my five senses can
dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee
who leaves unswayd the likeness of a man
thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be
only my plague thus far i count my gain
that she that makes me sin awards me pain


love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate
hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving
o but with mine compare thou thine own state
and thou shalt find it merits not reproving
or if it do not from those lips of thine
that have profaned their scarlet ornaments
and seald false bonds of love as oft as mine
robbd others beds revenues of their rents
be it lawful i love thee as thou lovest those
whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee
root pity in thy heart that when it grows
thy pity may deserve to pitied be
if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide
by self example mayst thou be denied


lo as a careful housewife runs to catch
one of her featherd creatures broke away
sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
in pursuit of the thing she would have stay
whilst her neglected child holds her in chase
cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
to follow that which flies before her face
not prizing her poor infants discontent
so runnst thou after that which flies from thee
whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind
but if thou catch thy hope turn back to me
and play the mothers part kiss me be kind
so will i pray that thou mayst have thy will
if thou turn back and my loud crying still


two loves i have of comfort and despair
which like two spirits do suggest me still
the better angel is a man right fair
the worser spirit a woman colourd ill
to win me soon to hell my female evil
tempteth my better angel from my side
and would corrupt my saint to be a devil
wooing his purity with her foul pride
and whether that my angel be turnd fiend
suspect i may but not directly tell
but being both from me both to each friend
i guess one angel in anothers hell
yet this shall i neer know but live in doubt
till my bad angel fire my good one out


those lips that loves own hand did make
breathed forth the sound that said i hate
to me that languishd for her sake
but when she saw my woeful state
straight in her heart did mercy come
chiding that tongue that ever sweet
was used in giving gentle doom
and taught it thus anew to greet
i hate she alterd with an end
that followd it as gentle day
doth follow night who like a fiend
from heaven to hell is flown away
i hate from hate away she threw
and saved my life saying not you


poor soul the centre of my sinful earth
these rebel powers that thee array
why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth
painting thy outward walls so costly gay
why so large cost having so short a lease
dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend
shall worms inheritors of this excess
eat up thy charge is this thy bodys end
then soul live thou upon thy servants loss
and let that pine to aggravate thy store
buy terms divine in selling hours of dross
within be fed without be rich no more
so shalt thou feed on death that feeds on men
and death once dead theres no more dying then


my love is as a fever longing still
for that which longer nurseth the disease
feeding on that which doth preserve the ill
the uncertain sickly appetite to please
my reason the physician to my love
angry that his prescriptions are not kept
hath left me and i desperate now approve
desire is death which physic did except
past cure i am now reason is past care
and frantic mad with evermore unrest
my thoughts and my discourse as madmens are
at random from the truth vainly expressd
for i have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright
who art as black as hell as dark as night


o me what eyes hath love put in my head
which have no correspondence with true sight
or if they have where is my judgment fled
that censures falsely what they see aright
if that be fair whereon my false eyes dote
what means the world to say it is not so
if it be not then love doth well denote
loves eye is not so true as all mens no
how can it o how can loves eye be true
that is so vexd with watching and with tears
no marvel then though i mistake my view
the sun itself sees not till heaven clears
o cunning love with tears thou keepst me blind
lest eyes well seeing thy foul faults should find


canst thou o cruel say i love thee not
when i against myself with thee partake
do i not think on thee when i forgot
am of myself all tyrant for thy sake
who hateth thee that i do call my friend
on whom frownst thou that i do fawn upon
nay if thou lourst on me do i not spend
revenge upon myself with present moan
what merit do i in myself respect
that is so proud thy service to despise
when all my best doth worship thy defect
commanded by the motion of thine eyes
but love hate on for now i know thy mind
those that can see thou lovest and i am blind


o from what power hast thou this powerful might
with insufficiency my heart to sway
to make me give the lie to my true sight
and swear that brightness doth not grace the day
whence hast thou this becoming of things ill
that in the very refuse of thy deeds
there is such strength and warrantize of skill
that in my mind thy worst all best exceeds
who taught thee how to make me love thee more
the more i hear and see just cause of hate
o though i love what others do abhor
with others thou shouldst not abhor my state
if thy unworthiness raised love in me
more worthy i to be beloved of thee


love is too young to know what conscience is
yet who knows not conscience is born of love
then gentle cheater urge not my amiss
lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove
for thou betraying me i do betray
my nobler part to my gross bodys treason
my soul doth tell my body that he may
triumph in love flesh stays no father reason
but rising at thy name doth point out thee
as his triumphant prize proud of this pride
he is contented thy poor drudge to be
to stand in thy affairs fall by thy side
no want of conscience hold it that i call
her love for whose dear love i rise and fall


in loving thee thou knowst i am forsworn
but thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing
in act thy bed vow broke and new faith torn
in vowing new hate after new love bearing
but why of two oaths breach do i accuse thee
when i break twenty i am perjured most
for all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
and all my honest faith in thee is lost
for i have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness
oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy
and to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness
or made them swear against the thing they see
for i have sworn thee fair more perjured i
to swear against the truth so foul a lie


cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep
a maid of dians this advantage found
and his love kindling fire did quickly steep
in a cold valley fountain of that ground
which borrowd from this holy fire of love
a dateless lively heat still to endure
and grew a seething bath which yet men prove
against strange maladies a sovereign cure
but at my mistress eye loves brand new fired
the boy for trial needs would touch my breast
i sick withal the help of bath desired
and thither hied a sad distemperd guest
but found no cure the bath for my help lies
where cupid got new fire my mistress eyes


the little love god lying once asleep
laid by his side his heart inflaming brand
whilst many nymphs that vowd chaste life to keep
came tripping by but in her maiden hand
the fairest votary took up that fire
which many legions of true hearts had warmd
and so the general of hot desire
was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmd
this brand she quenched in a cool well by
which from loves fire took heat perpetual
growing a bath and healthful remedy
for men diseased but i my mistress thrall
came there for cure and this by that i prove
loves fire heats water water cools not love


i weep for adonaishe is dead
oh weep for adonais though our tears
thaw not the frost which binds so dear a head
and thou sad hour selected from all years
to mourn our loss rouse thy obscure compeers
and teach them thine own sorrow say with me
died adonais till the future dares
forget the past his fate and fame shall be
an echo and a light unto eternity


where wert thou mighty mother when he lay
when thy son lay pierced by the shaft which flies
in darkness where was lorn urania
when adonais died with veiled eyes
mid listening echoes in her paradise
she sate while one with soft enamoured breath
rekindled all the fading melodies
with which like flowers that mock the corse beneath
he had adorned and hid the coming bulk of death


oh weep for adonaishe is dead
wake melancholy mother wake and weep
yet wherefore quench within their burning bed
thy fiery tears and let thy loud heart keep
like his a mute and uncomplaining sleep
for he is gone where all things wise and fair
descend oh dream not that the amorous deep
will yet restore him to the vital air
death feeds on his mute voice and laughs at our despair


most musical of mourners weep again
lament anew uraniahe died
who was the sire of an immortal strain
blind old and lonely when his countrys pride
the priest the slave and the liberticide
trampled and mocked with many a loathed rite
of lust and blood he went unterrified
into the gulf of death but his clear sprite
yet reigns oer earth the third among the sons of light


most musical of mourners weep anew
not all to that bright station dared to climb
and happier they their happiness who knew
whose tapers yet burn through that night of time
in which suns perished others more sublime
struck by the envious wrath of man or god
have sunk extinct in their refulgent prime
and some yet live treading the thorny road
which leads through toil and hate to fames serene abode


but now thy youngest dearest one has perished
the nursling of thy widowhood who grew
like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherished
and fed with true love tears instead of dew
most musical of mourners weep anew
thy extreme hope the loveliest and the last
the bloom whose petals nipt before they blew
died on the promise of the fruit is waste
the broken lily liesthe storm is overpast


to that high capital where kingly death
keeps his pale court in beauty and decay
he came and bought with price of purest breath
a grave among the eternalcome away
haste while the vault of blue italian day
is yet his fitting charnelroof while still
he lies as if in dewy sleep he lay
awake him not surely he takes his fill
of deep and liquid rest forgetful of all ill


he will awake no more oh never more
within the twilight chamber spreads apace
the shadow of white death and at the door
invisible corruption waits to trace
his extreme way to her dim dwellingplace
the eternal hunger sits but pity and awe
soothe her pale rage nor dares she to deface
so fair a prey till darkness and the law
of change shall oer his sleep the mortal curtain draw


oh weep for adonaisthe quick dreams
the passionwinged ministers of thought
who were his flocks whom near the living streams
of his young spirit he fed and whom he taught
the love which was its music wander not
wander no more from kindling brain to brain
but droop there whence they sprung and mourn their lot
round the cold heart where after their sweet pain
they neer will gather strength or find a home again


and one with trembling hands clasps his cold head
and fans him with her moonlight wings and cries
our love our hope our sorrow is not dead
see on the silken fringe of his faint eyes
like dew upon a sleeping flower there lies
a tear some dream has loosened from his brain
lost angel of a ruined paradise
she knew not twas her ownas with no stain
she faded like a cloud which had outwept its rain


one from a lucid urn of starry dew
washed his light limbs as if embalming them
another dipt her profuse locks and threw
the wreath upon him like an anadem
which frozen tears instead of pearls begem
another in her wilful grief would break
her bow and winged reeds as if to stem
a greater loss with one which was more weak
and dull the barbed fire against his frozen cheek


another splendour on his mouth alit
that mouth whence it was wont to draw the breath
which gave it strength to pierce the guarded wit
and pass into the panting heart beneath
with lightning and with music the damp death
quenched its caress upon his icy lips
and as a dying meteor stains a wreath
of moonlight vapour which the cold night clips
it flushed through his pale limbs and passed to its eclipse


and others camedesires and adorations
winged persuasions and veiled destinies
splendours and glooms and glimmering incarnations
of hopes and fears and twilight phantasies
and sorrow with her family of sighs
and pleasure blind with tears led by the gleam
of her own dying smile instead of eyes
came in slow pompthe moving pomp might seem
like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream


all he had loved and moulded into thought
from shape and hue and odour and sweet sound
lamented adonais morning sought
her eastern watchtower and her hair unbound
wet with the tears which should adorn the ground
dimmed the aerial eyes that kindle day
afar the melancholy thunder moaned
pale ocean in unquiet slumber lay
and the wild winds flew round sobbing in their dismay


lost echo sits amid the voiceless mountains
and feeds her grief with his remembered lay
and will no more reply to winds or fountains
or amorous birds perched on the young green spray
or herdsmans horn or bell at closing day
since she can mimic not his lips more dear
than those for whose disdain she pined away
into a shadow of all soundsa drear
murmur between their songs is all the woodmen hear


grief made the young spring wild and she threw down
her kindling buds as if she autumn were
or they dead leaves since her delight is flown
for whom should she have waked the sullen year
to phoebus was not hyacinth so dear
nor to himself narcissus as to both
thou adonais wan they stand and sere
amid the faint companions of their youth
with dew all turned to tearsodour to sighing ruth


thy spirits sister the lorn nightingale
mourns not her mate with such melodious pain
not so the eagle who like thee could scale
heaven and could nourish in the suns domain
her mighty young with morning doth complain
soaring and screaming round her empty nest
as albion wails for thee the curse of cain
light on his head who pierced thy innocent breast
and scared the angel soul that was its earthly guest


ah woe is me winter is come and gone
but grief returns with the revolving year
the airs and streams renew their joyous tone
the ants the bees the swallows reappear
fresh leaves and flowers deck the dead seasons bier
the amorous birds now pair in every brake
and build their mossy homes in field and brere
and the green lizard and the golden snake
like unimprisoned flames out of their trance awake


through wood and stream and field and hill and ocean
a quickening life from the earths heart has burst
as it has ever done with change and motion
from the great morning of the world when first
god dawned on chaos in its steam immersed
the lamps of heaven flash with a softer light
all baser things pant with lifes sacred thirst
diffuse themselves and spend in loves delight
the beauty and the joy of their renewed might


the leprous corpse touched by this spirit tender
exhales itself in flowers of gentle breath
like incarnations of the stars when splendour
is changed to fragrance they illumine death
and mock the merry worm that wakes beneath
nought we know dies shall that alone which knows
be as a sword consumed before the sheath
by sightless lightning th intense atom glows
a moment then is quenched in a most cold repose


alas that all we loved of him should be
but for our grief as if it had not been
and grief itself be mortal woe is me
whence are we and why are we of what scene
the actors or spectators great and mean
meet massed in death who lends what life must borrow
as long as skies are blue and fields are green
evening must usher night night urge the morrow
month follow month with woe and year wake year to sorrow


_he_ will awake no more oh never more
wake thou cried misery childless mother rise
out of thy sleep and slake in thy hearts core
a wound more fierce than his with tears and sighs
and all the dreams that watched uranias eyes
and all the echoes whom their sisters song
had held in holy silence cried arise
swift as a thought by the snake memory stung
from her ambrosial rest the fading splendour sprung


she rose like an autumnal night that springs
out of the east and follows wild and drear
the golden day which on eternal wings
even as a ghost abandoning a bier
had left the earth a corpse sorrow and fear
so struck so roused so rapt urania
so saddened round her like an atmosphere
of stormy mist so swept her on her way
even to the mournful place where adonais lay


out of her secret paradise she sped
through camps and cities rough with stone and steel
and human hearts which to her aery tread
yielding not wounded the invisible
palms of her tender feet whereer they fell
and barbed tongues and thoughts more sharp than they
rent the soft form they never could repel
whose sacred blood like the young tears of may
paved with eternal flowers that undeserving way


in the deathchamber for a moment death
shamed by the presence of that living might
blushed to annihilation and the breath
revisited those lips and lifes pale light
flashed through those limbs so late her dear delight
leave me not wild and drear and comfortless
as silent lightning leaves the starless night
leave me not cried urania her distress
roused death death rose and smiled and met her vain caress


stay yet awhile speak to me once again
kiss me so long but as a kiss may live
and in my heartless breast and burning brain
that word that kiss shall all thoughts else survive
with food of saddest memory kept alive
now thou art dead as if it were a part
of thee my adonais i would give
all that i am to be as thou now art
but i am chained to time and cannot thence depart


o gentle child beautiful as thou wert
why didst thou leave the trodden paths of men
too soon and with weak hands though mighty heart
dare the unpastured dragon in his den
defenceless as thou wert oh where was then
wisdom the mirrored shield or scorn the spear
or hadst thou waited the full cycle when
thy spirit should have filled its crescent sphere
the monsters of lifes waste had fled from thee like deer


the herded wolves bold only to pursue
the obscene ravens clamorous oer the dead
the vultures to the conquerors banner true
who feed where desolation first has fed
and whose wings rain contagionhow they fled
when like apollo from his golden bow
the pythian of the age one arrow sped
and smiledthe spoilers tempt no second blow
they fawn on the proud feet that spurn them lying low


the sun comes forth and many reptiles spawn
he sets and each ephemeral insect then
is gathered into death without a dawn
and the immortal stars awake again
so is it in the world of living men
a godlike mind soars forth in its delight
making earth bare and veiling heaven and when
it sinks the swarms that dimmed or shared its light
leave to its kindred lamps the spirits awful night


thus ceased she and the mountain shepherds came
their garlands sere their magic mantles rent
the pilgrim of eternity whose fame
over his living head like heaven is bent
an early but enduring monument
came veiling all the lightnings of his song
in sorrow from her wilds ierne sent
the sweetest lyrist of her saddest wrong
and love taught grief to fall like music from his tongue


midst others of less note came one frail form
a phantom among men companionless
as the last cloud of an expiring storm
whose thunder is its knell he as i guess
had gazed on natures naked loveliness
actaeonlike and now he fled astray
with feeble steps oer the worlds wilderness
and his own thoughts along that rugged way
pursued like raging hounds their father and their prey


a pardlike spirit beautiful and swift
a love in desolation maskeda power
girt round with weakness it can scarce uplift
the weight of the superincumbent hour
it is a dying lamp a falling shower
a breaking billoweven whilst we speak
is it not broken on the withering flower
the killing sun smiles brightly on a cheek
the life can burn in blood even while the heart may break


his head was bound with pansies overblown
and faded violets white and pied and blue
and a light spear topped with a cypress cone
round whose rude shaft dark ivy tresses grew
yet dripping with the forests noonday dew
vibrated as the everbeating heart
shook the weak hand that grasped it of that crew
he came the last neglected and apart
a herdabandoned deer struck by the hunters dart


all stood aloof and at his partial moan
smiled through their tears well knew that gentle band
who in anothers fate now wept his own
as in the accents of an unknown land
he sang new sorrow sad urania scanned
the strangers mien and murmured who art thou
he answered not but with a sudden hand
made bare his branded and ensanguined brow
which was like cains or christsoh that it should be so


what softer voice is hushed over the dead
athwart what brow is that dark mantle thrown
what form leans sadly oer the white deathbed
in mockery of monumental stone
the heavy heart heaving without a moan
if it be he who gentlest of the wise
taught soothed loved honoured the departed one
let me not vex with inharmonious sighs
the silence of that hearts accepted sacrifice


our adonais has drunk poisonoh
what deaf and viperous murderer could crown
lifes early cup with such a draught of woe
the nameless worm would now itself disown
it felt yet could escape the magic tone
whose prelude held all envy hate and wrong
but what was howling in one breast alone
silent with expectation of the song
whose masters hand is cold whose silver lyre unstrung


live thou whose infamy is not thy fame
live fear no heavier chastisement from me
thou noteless blot on a remembered name
but be thyself and know thyself to be
and ever at thy season be thou free
to spill the venom when thy fangs oerflow
remorse and selfcontempt shall cling to thee
hot shame shall burn upon thy secret brow
and like a beaten hound tremble thou shaltas now


nor let us weep that our delight is fled
far from these carrion kites that scream below
he wakes or sleeps with the enduring dead
thou canst not soar where he is sitting now
dust to the dust but the pure spirit shall flow
back to the burning fountain whence it came
a portion of the eternal which must glow
through time and change unquenchably the same
whilst thy cold embers choke the sordid hearth of shame


peace peace he is not dead he doth not sleep
he hath awakened from the dream of life
tis we who lost in stormy visions keep
with phantoms an unprofitable strife
and in mad trance strike with our spirits knife
invulnerable nothings _we_ decay
like corpses in a charnel fear and grief
convulse us and consume us day by day
and cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay


he has outsoared the shadow of our night
envy and calumny and hate and pain
and that unrest which men miscall delight
can touch him not and torture not again
from the contagion of the worlds slow stain
he is secure and now can never mourn
a heart grown cold a head grown grey in vain
nor when the spirits self has ceased to burn
with sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn


he lives he wakestis death is dead not he
mourn not for adonaisthou young dawn
turn all thy dew to splendour for from thee
the spirit thou lamentest is not gone
ye caverns and ye forests cease to moan
cease ye faint flowers and fountains and thou air
which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrown
oer the abandoned earth now leave it bare
even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair


he is made one with nature there is heard
his voice in all her music from the moan
of thunder to the song of nights sweet bird
he is a presence to be felt and known
in darkness and in light from herb and stone
spreading itself whereer that power may move
which has withdrawn his being to its own
which wields the world with never wearied love
sustains it from beneath and kindles it above


he is a portion of the loveliness
which once he made more lovely he doth bear
his part while the one spirits plastic stress
sweeps through the dull dense world compelling there
all new successions to the forms they wear
torturing th unwilling dross that checks its flight
to its own likeness as each mass may bear
and bursting in its beauty and its might
from trees and beasts and men into the heavens light


the splendours of the firmament of time
may be eclipsed but are extinguished not
like stars to their appointed height they climb
and death is a low mist which cannot blot
the brightness it may veil when lofty thought
lifts a young heart above its mortal lair
and love and life contend in it for what
shall be its earthly doom the dead live there
and move like winds of light on dark and stormy air


the inheritors of unfulfilled renown
rose from their thrones built beyond mortal thought
far in the unapparent chatterton
rose pale his solemn agony had not
yet faded from him sidney as he fought
and as he fell and as he lived and loved
sublimely mild a spirit without spot
arose and lucan by his death approved
oblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reproved


and many more whose names on earth are dark
but whose transmitted effluence cannot die
so long as fire outlives the parent spark
rose robed in dazzling immortality
thou art become as one of us they cry
it was for thee yon kingless sphere has long
swung blind in unascended majesty
silent alone amid an heaven of song
assume thy winged throne thou vesper of our throng


who mourns for adonais oh come forth
fond wretch and know thyself and him aright
clasp with thy panting soul the pendulous earth
as from a centre dart thy spirits light
beyond all worlds until its spacious might
satiate the void circumference then shrink
even to a point within our day and night
and keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink
when hope has kindled hope and lured thee to the brink


or go to rome which is the sepulchre
oh not of him but of our joy tis nought
that ages empires and religions there
lie buried in the ravage they have wrought
for such as he can lendthey borrow not
glory from those who made the world their prey
and he is gathered to the kings of thought
who waged contention with their times decay
and of the past are all that cannot pass away


go thou to romeat once the paradise
the grave the city and the wilderness
and where its wrecks like shattered mountains rise
and flowering weeds and fragrant copses dress
the bones of desolations nakedness
pass till the spirit of the spot shall lead
thy footsteps to a slope of green access
where like an infants smile over the dead
a light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread


and grey walls moulder round on which dull time
feeds like slow fire upon a hoary brand
and one keen pyramid with wedge sublime
pavilioning the dust of him who planned
this refuge for his memory doth stand
like flame transformed to marble and beneath
a field is spread on which a newer band
have pitched in heavens smile their camp of death
welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguished breath


here pause these graves are all too young as yet
to have outgrown the sorrow which consigned
its charge to each and if the seal is set
here on one fountain of a mourning mind
break it not thou too surely shalt thou find
thine own well full if thou returnest home
of tears and gall from the worlds bitter wind
seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb
what adonais is why fear we to become


the one remains the many change and pass
heavens light for ever shines earths shadows fly
life like a dome of manycoloured glass
stains the white radiance of eternity
until death tramples it to fragmentsdie
if thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek
follow where all is fledromes azure sky
flowers ruins statues music words are weak
the glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak


why linger why turn back why shrink my heart
thy hopes are gone before from all things here
they have departed thou shouldst now depart
a light is past from the revolving year
and man and woman and what still is dear
attracts to crush repels to make thee wither
the soft sky smiles the low wind whispers near
tis adonais calls oh hasten thither
no more let life divide what death can join together


that light whose smile kindles the universe
that beauty in which all things work and move
that benediction which the eclipsing curse
of birth can quench not that sustaining love
which through the web of being blindly wove
by man and beast and earth and air and sea
burns bright or dim as each are mirrors of
the fire for which all thirst now beams on me
consuming the last clouds of cold mortality


the breath whose might i have invoked in song
descends on me my spirits bark is driven
far from the shore far from the trembling throng
whose sails were never to the tempest given
the massy earth and sphered skies are riven
i am borne darkly fearfully afar
whilst burning through the inmost veil of heaven
the soul of adonais like a star
beacons from the abode where the eternal are


so now my summertask is ended mary
and i return to thee mine own hearts home
as to his queen some victor knight of faery
earning bright spoils for her enchanted dome
nor thou disdain that ere my fame become
a star among the stars of mortal night
if it indeed may cleave its natal gloom
its doubtful promise thus i would unite
with thy beloved name thou child of love and light


the toil which stole from thee so many an hour
is endedand the fruit is at thy feet
no longer where the woods to frame a bower
with interlaced branches mix and meet
or where with sound like many voices sweet
waterfalls leap among wild islands green
which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat
of mossgrown trees and weeds shall i be seen
but beside thee where still my heart has ever been


thoughts of great deeds were mine dear friend when first
the clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass
i do remember well the hour which burst
my spirits sleep a fresh maydawn it was
when i walked forth upon the glittering grass
and wept i knew not why until there rose
from the near schoolroom voices that alas
were but one echo from a world of woes
the harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes


and then i clasped my hands and looked around
but none was near to mock my streaming eyes
which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground
so without shame i spakei will be wise
and just and free and mild if in me lies
such power for i grow weary to behold
the selfish and the strong still tyrannise
without reproach or check i then controlled
my tears my heart grew calm and i was meek and bold


and from that hour did i with earnest thought
heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore
yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught
i cared to learn but from that secret store
wrought linked armour for my soul before
it might walk forth to war among mankind
thus power and hope were strengthened more and more
within me till there came upon my mind
a sense of loneliness a thirst with which i pined


alas that love should be a blight and snare
to those who seek all sympathies in one
such once i sought in vain then black despair
the shadow of a starless night was thrown
over the world in which i moved alone
yet never found i one not false to me
hard hearts and cold like weights of icy stone
which crushed and withered mine that could not be
aught but a lifeless clod until revived by thee


thou friend whose presence on my wintry heart
fell like bright spring upon some herbless plain
how beautiful and calm and free thou wert
in thy young wisdom when the mortal chain
of custom thou didst burst and rend in twain
and walked as free as light the clouds among
which many an envious slave then breathed in vain
from his dim dungeon and my spirit sprung
to meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long


no more alone through the worlds wilderness
although i trod the paths of high intent
i journeyed now no more companionless
where solitude is like despair i went
there is the wisdom of a stern content
when poverty can blight the just and good
when infamy dares mock the innocent
and cherished friends turn with the multitude
to trample this was ours and we unshaken stood


now has descended a serener hour
and with inconstant fortune friends return
though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power
which sayslet scorn be not repaid with scorn
and from thy side two gentle babes are born
to fill our home with smiles and thus are we
most fortunate beneath lifes beaming morn
and these delights and thou have been to me
the parents of the song i consecrate to thee


is it that now my inexperienced fingers
but strike the prelude of a loftier strain
or must the lyre on which my spirit lingers
soon pause in silence neer to sound again
though it might shake the anarch customs reign
and charm the minds of men to truths own sway
holier than was amphions i would fain
reply in hopebut i am worn away
and death and love are yet contending for their prey


and what art thou i know but dare not speak
time may interpret to his silent years
yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek
and in the light thine ample forehead wears
and in thy sweetest smiles and in thy tears
and in thy gentle speech a prophecy
is whispered to subdue my fondest fears
and through thine eyes even in thy soul i see
a lamp of vestal fire burning internally


they say that thou wert lovely from thy birth
of glorious parents thou aspiring child
i wonder notfor one then left this earth
whose life was like a setting planet mild
which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled
of its departing glory still her fame
shines on thee through the tempests dark and wild
which shake these latter days and thou canst claim
the shelter from thy sire of an immortal name


one voice came forth from many a mighty spirit
which was the echo of three thousand years
and the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it
as some lone man who in a desert hears
the music of his homeunwonted fears
fell on the pale oppressors of our race
and faith and custom and lowthoughted cares
like thunderstricken dragons for a space
left the torn human heart their food and dwellingplace


truths deathless voice pauses among mankind
if there must be no response to my cry
if men must rise and stamp with fury blind
on his pure name who loves themthou and i
sweet friend can look from our tranquillity
like lamps into the worlds tempestuous night
two tranquil stars while clouds are passing by
which wrap them from the foundering seamans sight
that burn from year to year with unextinguished light


when the last hope of trampled france had failed
like a brief dream of unremaining glory
from visions of despair i rose and scaled
the peak of an aerial promontory
whose caverned base with the vexed surge was hoary
and saw the golden dawn break forth and waken
each cloud and every wavebut transitory
the calm for sudden the firm earth was shaken
as if by the last wreck its frame were overtaken


so as i stood one blast of muttering thunder
burst in far peals along the waveless deep
when gathering fast around above and under
long trains of tremulous mist began to creep
until their complicating lines did steep
the orient sun in shadownot a sound
was heard one horrible repose did keep
the forests and the floods and all around
darkness more dread than night was poured upon the ground


hark tis the rushing of a wind that sweeps
earth and the ocean see the lightnings yawn
deluging heaven with fire and the lashed deeps
glitter and boil beneath it rages on
one mighty stream whirlwind and waves upthrown
lightning and hail and darkness eddying by
there is a pausethe seabirds that were gone
into their caves to shriek come forth to spy
what calm has falln on earth what light is in the sky


for where the irresistible storm had cloven
that fearful darkness the blue sky was seen
fretted with many a fair cloud interwoven
most delicately and the ocean green
beneath that opening spot of blue serene
quivered like burning emerald calm was spread
on all below but far on high between
earth and the upper air the vast clouds fled
countless and swift as leaves on autumns tempest shed


for ever as the war became more fierce
between the whirlwinds and the rack on high
that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce
the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie
far deep and motionless while through the sky
the pallid semicircle of the moon
passed on in slow and moving majesty
its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon
but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon


i could not choose but gaze a fascination
dwelt in that moon and sky and clouds which drew
my fancy thither and in expectation
of what i knew not i remainedthe hue
of the white moon amid that heaven so blue
suddenly stained with shadow did appear
a speck a cloud a shape approaching grew
like a great ship in the suns sinking sphere
beheld afar at sea and swift it came anear


even like a bark which from a chasm of mountains
dark vast and overhanging on a river
which there collects the strength of all its fountains
comes forth whilst with the speed its frame doth quiver
sails oars and stream tending to one endeavour
so from that chasm of light a winged form
on all the winds of heaven approaching ever
floated dilating as it came the storm
pursued it with fierce blasts and lightnings swift and warm


a course precipitous of dizzy speed
suspending thought and breath a monstrous sight
for in the air do i behold indeed
an eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight
and now relaxing its impetuous flight
before the aerial rock on which i stood
the eagle hovering wheeled to left and right
and hung with lingering wings over the flood
and startled with its yells the wide airs solitude


a shaft of light upon its wings descended
and every golden feather gleamed therein
feather and scale inextricably blended
the serpents mailed and manycoloured skin
shone through the plumes its coils were twined within
by many a swoln and knotted fold and high
and far the neck receding lithe and thin
sustained a crested head which warily
shifted and glanced before the eagles steadfast eye


around around in ceaseless circles wheeling
with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed
incessantlysometimes on high concealing
its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed
drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed
and casting back its eager head with beak
and talon unremittingly assailed
the wreathed serpent who did ever seek
upon his enemys heart a mortal wound to wreak


what life what power was kindled and arose
within the sphere of that appalling fray
for from the encounter of those wondrous foes
a vapour like the seas suspended spray
hung gathered in the void air far away
floated the shattered plumes bright scales did leap
whereer the eagles talons made their way
like sparks into the darknessas they sweep
blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep


swift chances in that combatmany a check
and many a change a dark and wild turmoil
sometimes the snake around his enemys neck
locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil
until the eagle faint with pain and toil
remitted his strong flight and near the sea
languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil
his adversary who then reared on high
his red and burning crest radiant with victory


then on the white edge of the bursting surge
where they had sunk together would the snake
relax his suffocating grasp and scourge
the wind with his wild writhings for to break
that chain of torment the vast bird would shake
the strength of his unconquerable wings
as in despair and with his sinewy neck
dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings
then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs


wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength
thus long but unprevailingthe event
of that portentous fight appeared at length
until the lamp of day was almost spent
it had endured when lifeless stark and rent
hung high that mighty serpent and at last
fell to the sea while oer the continent
with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed
heavily borne away on the exhausted blast


and with it fled the tempest so that ocean
and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere
only twas strange to see the red commotion
of waves like mountains oer the sinking sphere
of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear
amid the calm down the steep path i wound
to the seashorethe evening was most clear
and beautiful and there the sea i found
calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound


there was a woman beautiful as morning
sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand
of the waste seafair as one flower adorning
an icy wilderness each delicate hand
lay crossed upon her bosom and the band
of her dark hair had falln and so she sate
looking upon the waves on the bare strand
upon the seamark a small boat did wait
fair as herself like love by hope left desolate


it seemed that this fair shape had looked upon
that unimaginable fight and now
that her sweet eyes were weary of the sun
as brightly it illustrated her woe
for in the tears which silently to flow
paused not its lustre hung she watching aye
the foamwreaths which the faint tide wove below
upon the spangled sands groaned heavily
and after every groan looked up over the sea


and when she saw the wounded serpent make
his path between the waves her lips grew pale
parted and quivered the tears ceased to break
from her immovable eyes no voice of wail
escaped her but she rose and on the gale
loosening her starbright robe and shadowy hair
poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale
that opened to the ocean caught it there
and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air


she spake in language whose strange melody
might not belong to earth i heard alone
what made its music more melodious be
the pity and the love of every tone
but to the snake those accents sweet were known
his native tongue and hers nor did he beat
the hoar spray idly then but winding on
through the green shadows of the waves that meet
near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet


then on the sands the woman sate again
and wept and clasped her hands and all between
renewed the unintelligible strain
of her melodious voice and eloquent mien
and she unveiled her bosom and the green
and glancing shadows of the sea did play
oer its marmoreal depthone moment seen
for ere the next the serpent did obey
her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay


then she arose and smiled on me with eyes
serene yet sorrowing like that planet fair
while yet the daylight lingereth in the skies
which cleaves with arrowy beams the darkred air
and said to grieve is wise but the despair
was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep
this shalt thou know and more if thou dost dare
with me and with this serpent oer the deep
a voyage divine and strange companionship to keep


her voice was like the wildest saddest tone
yet sweet of some loved voice heard long ago
i wept shall this fair woman all alone
over the sea with that fierce serpent go
his head is on her heart and who can know
how soon he may devour his feeble prey
such were my thoughts when the tide gan to flow
and that strange boat like the moons shade did sway
amid reflected stars that in the waters lay


a boat of rare device which had no sail
but its own curved prow of thin moonstone
wrought like a web of texture fine and frail
to catch those gentlest winds which are not known
to breathe but by the steady speed alone
with which it cleaves the sparkling sea and now
we are embarkedthe mountains hang and frown
over the starry deep that gleams below
a vast and dim expanse as oer the waves we go


and as we sailed a strange and awful tale
that woman told like such mysterious dream
as makes the slumberers cheek with wonder pale
twas midnight and around a shoreless stream
wide ocean rolled when that majestic theme
shrined in her heart found utterance and she bent
her looks on mine those eyes a kindling beam
of love divine into my spirit sent
and ere her lips could move made the air eloquent


speak not to me but hear much shalt thou learn
much must remain unthought and more untold
in the dark futures everflowing urn
know then that from the depth of ages old
two powers oer mortal things dominion hold
ruling the world with a divided lot
immortal allpervading manifold
twin genii equal godswhen life and thought
sprang forth they burst the womb of inessential nought


the earliest dweller of the world alone
stood on the verge of chaos lo afar
oer the wide wild abyss two meteors shone
sprung from the depth of its tempestuous jar
a bloodred comet and the morning star
mingling their beams in combatas he stood
all thoughts within his mind waged mutual war
in dreadful sympathywhen to the flood
that fair star fell he turned and shed his brothers blood


thus evil triumphed and the spirit of evil
one power of many shapes which none may know
one shape of many names the fiend did revel
in victory reigning oer a world of woe
for the new race of man went to and fro
famished and homeless loathed and loathing wild
and hating goodfor his immortal foe
he changed from starry shape beauteous and mild
to a dire snake with man and beast unreconciled


the darkness lingering oer the dawn of things
was evils breath and life this made him strong
to soar aloft with overshadowing wings
and the great spirit of good did creep among
the nations of mankind and every tongue
cursed and blasphemed him as he passed for none
knew good from evil though their names were hung
in mockery oer the fane where many a groan
as king and lord and god the conquering fiend did own


the fiend whose name was legion death decay
earthquake and blight and want and madness pale
winged and wan diseases an array
numerous as leaves that strew the autumnal gale
poison a snake in flowers beneath the veil
of food and mirth hiding his mortal head
and without whom all these might nought avail
fear hatred faith and tyranny who spread
those subtle nets which snare the living and the dead


his spirit is their power and they his slaves
in air and light and thought and language dwell
and keep their state from palaces to graves
in all resorts of meninvisible
but when in ebon mirror nightmare fell
to tyrant or impostor bids them rise
black winged demon formswhom from the hell
his reign and dwelling beneath nether skies
he loosens to their dark and blasting ministries


in the worlds youth his empire was as firm
as its foundationssoon the spirit of good
though in the likeness of a loathsome worm
sprang from the billows of the formless flood
which shrank and fled and with that fiend of blood
renewed the doubtful warthrones then first shook
and earths immense and trampled multitude
in hope on their own powers began to look
and fear the demon pale his sanguine shrine forsook


then greece arose and to its bards and sages
in dream the goldenpinioned genii came
even where they slept amid the night of ages
steeping their hearts in the divinest flame
which thy breath kindled power of holiest name
and oft in cycles since when darkness gave
new weapons to thy foe their sunlike fame
upon the combat shonea light to save
like paradise spread forth beyond the shadowy grave


such is this conflictwhen mankind doth strive
with its oppressors in a strife of blood
or when free thoughts like lightnings are alive
and in each bosom of the multitude
justice and truth with customs hydra brood
wage silent war when priests and kings dissemble
in smiles or frowns their fierce disquietude
when round pure hearts a host of hopes assemble
the snake and eagle meetthe worlds foundations tremble


thou hast beheld that fightwhen to thy home
thou dost return steep not its hearth in tears
though thou mayst hear that earth is now become
the tyrants garbage which to his compeers
the vile reward of their dishonoured years
he will dividing givethe victor fiend
omnipotent of yore now quails and fears
his triumph dearly won which soon will lend
an impulse swift and sure to his approaching end


list stranger list mine is an human form
like that thou wearesttouch meshrink not now
my hand thou feelst is not a ghosts but warm
with human bloodtwas many years ago
since first my thirsting soul aspired to know
the secrets of this wondrous world when deep
my heart was pierced with sympathy for woe
which could not be mine own and thought did keep
in dream unnatural watch beside an infants sleep


woe could not be mine own since far from men
i dwelt a free and happy orphan child
by the seashore in a deep mountain glen
and near the waves and through the forests wild
i roamed to storm and darkness reconciled
for i was calm while tempest shook the sky
but when the breathless heavens in beauty smiled
i wept sweet tears yet too tumultuously
for peace and clasped my hands aloft in ecstasy


these were forebodings of my fatebefore
a womans heart beat in my virgin breast
it had been nurtured in divinest lore
a dying poet gave me books and blessed
with wild but holy talk the sweet unrest
in which i watched him as he died away
a youth with hoary haira fleeting guest
of our lone mountains and this lore did sway
my spirit like a storm contending there alway


thus the dark tale which history doth unfold
i knew but not methinks as others know
for they weep not and wisdom had unrolled
the clouds which hide the gulf of mortal woe
to few can she that warning vision show
for i loved all things with intense devotion
so that when hopes deep source in fullest flow
like earthquake did uplift the stagnant ocean
of human thoughtsmine shook beneath the wide emotion


when first the living blood through all these veins
kindled a thought in sense great france sprang forth
and seized as if to break the ponderous chains
which bind in woe the nations of the earth
i saw and started from my cottagehearth
and to the clouds and waves in tameless gladness
shrieked till they caught immeasurable mirth
and laughed in light and music soon sweet madness
was poured upon my heart a soft and thrilling sadness


deep slumber fell on memy dreams were fire
soft and delightful thoughts did rest and hover
like shadows oer my brain and strange desire
the tempest of a passion raging over
my tranquil soul its depths with light did cover
which passed and calm and darkness sweeter far
camethen i loved but not a human lover
for when i rose from sleep the morning star
shone through the woodbinewreaths which round my casement were


twas like an eye which seemed to smile on me
i watched till by the sun made pale it sank
under the billows of the heaving sea
but from its beams deep love my spirit drank
and to my brain the boundless world now shrank
into one thoughtone imageyes for ever
even like the dayspring poured on vapours dank
the beams of that one star did shoot and quiver
through my benighted mindand were extinguished never


the day passed thus at night methought in dream
a shape of speechless beauty did appear
it stood like light on a careering stream
of golden clouds which shook the atmosphere
a winged youth his radiant brow did wear
the morning star a wild dissolving bliss
over my frame he breathed approaching near
and bent his eyes of kindling tenderness
near mine and on my lips impressed a lingering kiss


and said a spirit loves thee mortal maiden
how wilt thou prove thy worth then joy and sleep
together fled my soul was deeply laden
and to the shore i went to muse and weep
but as i moved over my heart did creep
a joy less soft but more profound and strong
than my sweet dream and it forbade to keep
the path of the seashore that spirits tongue
seemed whispering in my heart and bore my steps along


how to that vast and peopled city led
which was a field of holy warfare then
i walked among the dying and the dead
and shared in fearless deeds with evil men
calm as an angel in the dragons den
how i braved death for liberty and truth
and spurned at peace and power and fameand when
those hopes had lost the glory of their youth
how sadly i returnedmight move the hearers ruth


warm tears throng fast the tale may not be said
know then that when this grief had been subdued
i was not left like others cold and dead
the spirit whom i loved in solitude
sustained his child the tempestshaken wood
the waves the fountains and the hush of night
these were his voice and well i understood
his smile divine when the calm sea was bright
with silent stars and heaven was breathless with delight


in lonely glens amid the roar of rivers
when the dim nights were moonless have i known
joys which no tongue can tell my pale lip quivers
when thought revisits themknow thou alone
that after many wondrous years were flown
i was awakened by a shriek of woe
and over me a mystic robe was thrown
by viewless hands and a bright star did glow
before my stepsthe snake then met his mortal foe


thou fearest not then the serpent on thy heart
fear it she said with brief and passionate cry
and spake no more that silence made me start
i looked and we were sailing pleasantly
swift as a cloud between the sea and sky
beneath the rising moon seen far away
mountains of ice like sapphire piled on high
hemming the horizon round in silence lay
on the still watersthese we did approach alway


and swift and swifter grew the vessels motion
so that a dizzy trance fell on my brain
wild music woke me we had passed the ocean
which girds the pole natures remotest reign
and we glode fast oer a pellucid plain
of waters azure with the noontide day
ethereal mountains shone arounda fane
stood in the midst girt by green isles which lay
on the blue sunny deep resplendent far away


it was a temple such as mortal hand
has never built nor ecstasy nor dream
reared in the cities of enchanted land
twas likest heaven ere yet days purple stream
ebbs oer the western forest while the gleam
of the unrisen moon among the clouds
is gatheringwhen with many a golden beam
the thronging constellations rush in crowds
paving with fire the sky and the marmoreal floods


like what may be conceived of this vast dome
when from the depths which thought can seldom pierce
genius beholds it rise his native home
girt by the deserts of the universe
yet nor in paintings light or mightier verse
or sculptures marble language can invest
that shape to mortal sensesuch glooms immerse
that incommunicable sight and rest
upon the labouring brain and overburdened breast


winding among the lawny islands fair
whose blosmy forests starred the shadowy deep
the wingless boat paused where an ivory stair
its fretwork in the crystal sea did steep
encircling that vast fanes aerial heap
we disembarked and through a portal wide
we passedwhose roof of moonstone carved did keep
a glimmering oer the forms on every side
sculptures like life and thought immovable deepeyed


we came to a vast hall whose glorious roof
was diamond which had drunk the lightnings sheen
in darkness and now poured it through the woof
of spellinwoven clouds hung there to screen
its blinding splendourthrough such veil was seen
that work of subtlest power divine and rare
orb above orb with starry shapes between
and horned moons and meteors strange and fair
on nightblack columns poisedone hollow hemisphere


ten thousand columns in that quivering light
distinctbetween whose shafts wound far away
the long and labyrinthine aislesmore bright
with their own radiance than the heaven of day
and on the jasper walls around there lay
paintings the poesy of mightiest thought
which did the spirits history display
a tale of passionate change divinely taught
which in their winged dance unconscious genii wrought


beneath there sate on many a sapphire throne
the great who had departed from mankind
a mighty senatesome whose white hair shone
like mountain snow mild beautiful and blind
some female forms whose gestures beamed with mind
and ardent youths and children bright and fair
and some had lyres whose strings were intertwined
with pale and clinging flames which ever there
waked faint yet thrilling sounds that pierced the crystal air


one seat was vacant in the midst a throne
reared on a pyramid like sculptured flame
distinct with circling steps which rested on
their own deep firesoon as the woman came
into that hall she shrieked the spirits name
and fell and vanished slowly from the sight
darkness arose from her dissolving frame
which gathering filled that dome of woven light
blotting its sphered stars with supernatural night


then first two glittering lights were seen to glide
in circles on the amethystine floor
small serpent eyes trailing from side to side
like meteors on a rivers grassy shore
they round each other rolled dilating more
and morethen rose commingling into one
one clear and mighty planet hanging oer
a cloud of deepest shadow which was thrown
athwart the glowing steps and the crystalline throne


the cloud which rested on that cone of flame
was cloven beneath the planet sate a form
fairer than tongue can speak or thought may frame
the radiance of whose limbs roselike and warm
flowed forth and did with softest light inform
the shadowy dome the sculptures and the state
of those assembled shapeswith clinging charm
sinking upon their hearts and mine he sate
majestic yet most mildcalm yet compassionate


wonder and joy a passing faintness threw
over my browa hand supported me
whose touch was magic strength an eye of blue
looked into mine like moonlight soothingly
and a voice saidthou must a listener be
this daytwo mighty spirits now return
like birds of calm from the worlds raging sea
they pour fresh light from hopes immortal urn
a tale of human powerdespair notlist and learn


i looked and lo one stood forth eloquently
his eyes were dark and deep and the clear brow
which shadowed them was like the morning sky
the cloudless heaven of spring when in their flow
through the bright air the soft winds as they blow
wake the green worldhis gestures did obey
the oracular mind that made his features glow
and where his curved lips halfopen lay
passions divinest stream had made impetuous way


beneath the darkness of his outspread hair
he stood thus beautiful but there was one
who sate beside him like his shadow there
and held his handfar lovelier she was known
to be thus fair by the few lines alone
which through her floating locks and gathered cloak
glances of souldissolving glory shone
none else beheld her eyesin him they woke
memories which found a tongue as thus he silence broke


the starlight smile of children the sweet looks
of women the fair breast from which i fed
the murmur of the unreposing brooks
and the green light which shifting overhead
some tangled bower of vines around me shed
the shells on the seasand and the wild flowers
the lamplight through the rafters cheerly spread
and on the twining flaxin lifes young hours
these sights and sounds did nurse my spirits folded powers


in argolis beside the echoing sea
such impulses within my mortal frame
arose and they were dear to memory
like tokens of the deadbut others came
soon in another shape the wondrous fame
of the past world the vital words and deeds
of minds whom neither time nor change can tame
traditions dark and old whence evil creeds
start forth and whose dim shade a stream of poison feeds


i heard as all have heard the various story
of human life and wept unwilling tears
feeble historians of its shame and glory
false disputants on all its hopes and fears
victims who worshipped ruin chroniclers
of daily scorn and slaves who loathed their state
yet flattering power had given its ministers
a throne of judgement in the gravetwas fate
that among such as these my youth should seek its mate


the land in which i lived by a fell bane
was withered up tyrants dwelt side by side
and stabled in our homesuntil the chain
stifled the captives cry and to abide
that blasting curse men had no shameall vied
in evil slave and despot fear with lust
strange fellowship through mutual hate had tied
like two dark serpents tangled in the dust
which on the paths of men their mingling poison thrust


earth our bright home its mountains and its waters
and the ethereal shapes which are suspended
over its green expanse and those fair daughters
the clouds of sun and ocean who have blended
the colours of the air since first extended
it cradled the young world none wandered forth
to see or feel a darkness had descended
on every heart the light which shows its worth
must among gentle thoughts and fearless take its birth


this vital world this home of happy spirits
was as a dungeon to my blasted kind
all that despair from murdered hope inherits
they sought and in their helpless misery blind
a deeper prison and heavier chains did find
and stronger tyrantsa dark gulf before
the realm of a stern ruler yawned behind
terror and time conflicting drove and bore
on their tempestuous flood the shrieking wretch from shore


out of that oceans wrecks had guilt and woe
framed a dark dwelling for their homeless thought
and starting at the ghosts which to and fro
glide oer its dim and gloomy strand had brought
the worship thence which they each other taught
well might men loathe their life well might they turn
even to the ills again from which they sought
such refuge after deathwell might they learn
to gaze on this fair world with hopeless unconcern


for they all pined in bondage body and soul
tyrant and slave victim and torturer bent
before one power to which supreme control
over their will by their own weakness lent
made all its many names omnipotent
all symbols of things evil all divine
and hymns of blood or mockery which rent
the air from all its fanes did intertwine
impostures impious toils round each discordant shrine


i heard as all have heard lifes various story
and in no careless heart transcribed the tale
but from the sneers of men who had grown hoary
in shame and scorn from groans of crowds made pale
by famine from a mothers desolate wail
oer her polluted child from innocent blood
poured on the earth and brows anxious and pale
with the hearts warfare did i gather food
to feed my many thoughtsa tameless multitude


i wandered through the wrecks of days departed
far by the desolated shore when even
oer the still sea and jagged islets darted
the light of moonrise in the northern heaven
among the clouds near the horizon driven
the mountains lay beneath one planet pale
around me broken tombs and columns riven
looked vast in twilight and the sorrowing gale
waked in those ruins gray its everlasting wail


i knew not who had framed these wonders then
nor had i heard the story of their deeds
but dwellings of a race of mightier men
and monuments of less ungentle creeds
tell their own tale to him who wisely heeds
the language which they speak and now to me
the moonlight making pale the blooming weeds
the bright stars shining in the breathless sea
interpreted those scrolls of mortal mystery


such man has been and such may yet become
ay wiser greater gentler even than they
who on the fragments of yon shattered dome
have stamped the sign of poweri felt the sway
of the vast stream of ages bear away
my floating thoughtsmy heart beat loud and fast
even as a storm let loose beneath the ray
of the still moon my spirit onward passed
beneath truths steady beams upon its tumult cast


it shall be thus no more too long too long
sons of the glorious dead have ye lain bound
in darkness and in ruinhope is strong
justice and truth their winged child have found
awake arise until the mighty sound
of your career shall scatter in its gust
the thrones of the oppressor and the ground
hide the last altars unregarded dust
whose idol has so long betrayed your impious trust


it must be soi will arise and waken
the multitude and like a sulphurous hill
which on a sudden from its snows has shaken
the swoon of ages it shall burst and fill
the world with cleansing fire it must it will
it may not be restrainedand who shall stand
amid the rocking earthquake steadfast still
but laon on high freedoms desert land
a tower whose marble walls the leagued storms withstand


one summer night in commune with the hope
thus deeply fed amid those ruins gray
i watched beneath the dark skys starry cope
and ever from that hour upon me lay
the burden of this hope and night or day
in vision or in dream clove to my breast
among mankind or when gone far away
to the lone shores and mountains twas a guest
which followed where i fled and watched when i did rest


these hopes found words through which my spirit sought
to weave a bondage of such sympathy
as might create some response to the thought
which ruled me nowand as the vapours lie
bright in the outspread mornings radiancy
so were these thoughts invested with the light
of language and all bosoms made reply
on which its lustre streamed wheneer it might
through darkness wide and deep those tranced spirits smite


yes many an eye with dizzy tears was dim
and oft i thought to clasp my own hearts brother
when i could feel the listeners senses swim
and hear his breath its own swift gaspings smother
even as my words evoked themand another
and yet another i did fondly deem
felt that we all were sons of one great mother
and the cold truth such sad reverse did seem
as to awake in grief from some delightful dream


yes oft beside the ruined labyrinth
which skirts the hoary caves of the green deep
did laon and his friend on one gray plinth
round whose worn base the wild waves hiss and leap
resting at eve a lofty converse keep
and that this friend was false may now be said
calmlythat he like other men could weep
tears which are lies and could betray and spread
snares for that guileless heart which for his own had bled


then had no great aim recompensed my sorrow
i must have sought dark respite from its stress
in dreamless rest in sleep that sees no morrow
for to tread lifes dismaying wilderness
without one smile to cheer one voice to bless
amid the snares and scoffs of human kind
is hardbut i betrayed it not nor less
with love that scorned return sought to unbind
the interwoven clouds which make its wisdom blind


with deathless minds which leave where they have passed
a path of light my soul communion knew
till from that glorious intercourse at last
as from a mine of magic store i drew
words which were weaponsround my heart there grew
the adamantine armour of their power
and from my fancy wings of golden hue
sprang forthyet not alone from wisdoms tower
a minister of truth these plumes young laon bore


an orphan with my parents lived whose eyes
were lodestars of delight which drew me home
when i might wander forth nor did i prize
aught human thing beneath heavens mighty dome
beyond this child so when sad hours were come
and baffled hope like ice still clung to me
since kin were cold and friends had now become
heartless and false i turned from all to be
cythna the only source of tears and smiles to thee


what wert thou then a child most infantine
yet wandering far beyond that innocent age
in all but its sweet looks and mien divine
even then methought with the worlds tyrant rage
a patient warfare thy young heart did wage
when those soft eyes of scarcely conscious thought
some tale or thine own fancies would engage
to overflow with tears or converse fraught
with passion oer their depths its fleeting light had wrought


she moved upon this earth a shape of brightness
a power that from its objects scarcely drew
one impulse of her beingin her lightness
most like some radiant cloud of morning dew
which wanders through the waste airs pathless blue
to nourish some far desert she did seem
beside me gathering beauty as she grew
like the bright shade of some immortal dream
which walks when tempest sleeps the wave of lifes dark stream


as mine own shadow was this child to me
a second self far dearer and more fair
which clothed in undissolving radiancy
all those steep paths which languor and despair
of human things had made so dark and bare
but which i trod alonenor till bereft
of friends and overcome by lonely care
knew i what solace for that loss was left
though by a bitter wound my trusting heart was cleft


once she was dear now she was all i had
to love in human lifethis playmate sweet
this child of twelve years oldso she was made
my sole associate and her willing feet
wandered with mine where earth and ocean meet
beyond the aereal mountains whose vast cells
the unreposing billows ever beat
through forests wild and old and lawny dells
where boughs of incense droop over the emerald wells


and warm and light i felt her clasping hand
when twined in mine she followed where i went
through the lone paths of our immortal land
it had no waste but some memorial lent
which strung me to my toilsome monument
vital with mind then cythna by my side
until the bright and beaming day were spent
would rest with looks entreating to abide
too earnest and too sweet ever to be denied


and soon i could not have refused herthus
for ever day and night we two were neer
parted but when brief sleep divided us
and when the pauses of the lulling air
of noon beside the sea had made a lair
for her soothed senses in my arms she slept
and i kept watch over her slumbers there
while as the shifting visions over her swept
amid her innocent rest by turns she smiled and wept


and in the murmur of her dreams was heard
sometimes the name of laonsuddenly
she would arise and like the secret bird
whom sunset wakens fill the shore and sky
with her sweet accents a wild melody
hymns which my soul had woven to freedom strong
the source of passion whence they rose to be
triumphant strains which like a spirits tongue
to the enchanted waves that child of glory sung


her white arms lifted through the shadowy stream
of her loose hair oh excellently great
seemed to me then my purpose the vast theme
of those impassioned songs when cythna sate
amid the calm which rapture doth create
after its tumult her heart vibrating
her spirit oer the oceans floating state
from her deep eyes far wandering on the wing
of visions that were mine beyond its utmost spring


for before cythna loved it had my song
peopled with thoughts the boundless universe
a mighty congregation which were strong
whereer they trod the darkness to disperse
the cloud of that unutterable curse
which clings upon mankindall things became
slaves to my holy and heroic verse
earth sea and sky the planets life and fame
and fate or whateer else binds the worlds wondrous frame


and this beloved child thus felt the sway
of my conceptions gathering like a cloud
the very wind on which it rolls away
hers too were all my thoughts ere yet endowed
with music and with light their fountains flowed
in poesy and her still and earnest face
pallid with feelings which intensely glowed
within was turned on mine with speechless grace
watching the hopes which there her heart had learned to trace


in me communion with this purest being
kindled intenser zeal and made me wise
in knowledge which in hers mine own mind seeing
left in the human world few mysteries
how without fear of evil or disguise
was cythnawhat a spirit strong and mild
which death or pain or peril could despise
yet melt in tenderness what genius wild
yet mighty was enclosed within one simple child


new lore was thisold age with its gray hair
and wrinkled legends of unworthy things
and icy sneers is nought it cannot dare
to burst the chains which life for ever flings
on the entangled souls aspiring wings
so is it cold and cruel and is made
the careless slave of that dark power which brings
evil like blight on man who still betrayed
laughs oer the grave in which his living hopes are laid


nor are the strong and the severe to keep
the empire of the world thus cythna taught
even in the visions of her eloquent sleep
unconscious of the power through which she wrought
the woof of such intelligible thought
as from the tranquil strength which cradled lay
in her smilepeopled rest my spirit sought
why the deceiver and the slave has sway
oer heralds so divine of truths arising day


within that fairest form the female mind
untainted by the poison clouds which rest
on the dark world a sacred home did find
but else from the wide earths maternal breast
victorious evil which had dispossessed
all native power had those fair children torn
and made them slaves to soothe his vile unrest
and minister to lust its joys forlorn
till they had learned to breathe the atmosphere of scorn


this misery was but coldly felt till she
became my only friend who had endued
my purpose with a wider sympathy
thus cythna mourned with me the servitude
in which the half of humankind were mewed
victims of lust and hate the slaves of slaves
she mourned that grace and power were thrown as food
to the hyena lust who among graves
over his loathed meal laughing in agony raves


and i still gazing on that glorious child
even as these thoughts flushed oer hercythna sweet
well with the world art thou unreconciled
never will peace and human nature meet
till free and equal man and woman greet
domestic peace and ere this power can make
in human hearts its calm and holy seat
this slavery must be brokenas i spake
from cythnas eyes a light of exultation brake


she replied earnestlyit shall be mine
this taskmine laonthou hast much to gain
nor wilt thou at poor cythnas pride repine
if she should lead a happy female train
to meet thee over the rejoicing plain
when myriads at thy call shall throng around
the golden citythen the child did strain
my arm upon her tremulous heart and wound
her own about my neck till some reply she found


i smiled and spake notwherefore dost thou smile
at what i say laon i am not weak
and though my cheek might become pale the while
with thee if thou desirest will i seek
through their array of banded slaves to wreak
ruin upon the tyrants i had thought
it was more hard to turn my unpractised cheek
to scorn and shame and this beloved spot
and thee o dearest friend to leave and murmur not


whence came i what i am thou laon knowest
how a young child should thus undaunted be
methinks it is a power which thou bestowest
through which i seek by most resembling thee
so to become most good and great and free
yet far beyond this oceans utmost roar
in towers and huts are many like to me
who could they see thine eyes or feel such lore
as i have learnt from them like me would fear no more


thinkst thou that i shall speak unskilfully
and none will heed me i remember now
how once a slave in tortures doomed to die
was saved because in accents sweet and low
he sung a song his judge loved long ago
as he was led to deathall shall relent
who hear metears as mine have flowed shall flow
hearts beat as mine now beats with such intent
as renovates the world a will omnipotent


yes i will tread prides golden palaces
through penurys roofless huts and squalid cells
will i descend whereer in abjectness
woman with some vile slave her tyrant dwells
there with the music of thine own sweet spells
will disenchant the captives and will pour
for the despairing from the crystal wells
of thy deep spirit reasons mighty lore
and power shall then abound and hope arise once more


can man be free if woman be a slave
chain one who lives and breathes this boundless air
to the corruption of a closed grave
can they whose mates are beasts condemned to bear
scorn heavier far than toil or anguish dare
to trample their oppressors in their home
among their babes thou knowest a curse would wear
the shape of womanhoary crime would come
behind and fraud rebuild religions tottering dome


i am a childi would not yet depart
when i go forth alone bearing the lamp
aloft which thou hast kindled in my heart
millions of slaves from many a dungeon damp
shall leap in joy as the benumbing cramp
of ages leaves their limbsno ill may harm
thy cythna evertruth its radiant stamp
has fixed as an invulnerable charm
upon her childrens brow dark falsehood to disarm


wait yet awhile for the appointed day
thou wilt depart and i with tears shall stand
watching thy dim sail skirt the ocean gray
amid the dwellers of this lonely land
i shall remain aloneand thy command
shall then dissolve the worlds unquiet trance
and multitudinous as the desert sand
borne on the storm its millions shall advance
thronging round thee the light of their deliverance


then like the forests of some pathless mountain
which from remotest glens two warring winds
involve in fire which not the loosened fountain
of broadest floods might quench shall all the kinds
of evil catch from our uniting minds
the spark which must consume themcythna then
will have cast off the impotence that binds
her childhood now and through the paths of men
will pass as the charmed bird that haunts the serpents den


we parto laon i must dare nor tremble
to meet those looks no moreoh heavy stroke
sweet brother of my soul can i dissemble
the agony of this thoughtas thus she spoke
the gathered sobs her quivering accents broke
and in my arms she hid her beating breast
i remained still for tearssudden she woke
as one awakes from sleep and wildly pressed
my bosom her whole frame impetuously possessed


we part to meet againbut yon blue waste
yon desert wide and deep holds no recess
within whose happy silence thus embraced
we might survive all ills in one caress
nor doth the gravei fear tis passionless
nor yon cold vacant heavenwe meet again
within the minds of men whose lips shall bless
our memory and whose hopes its light retain
when these dissevered bones are trodden in the plain


i could not speak though she had ceased for now
the fountains of her feeling swift and deep
seemed to suspend the tumult of their flow
so we arose and by the starlight steep
went homewardneither did we speak nor weep
but pale were calm with passionthus subdued
like evening shades that oer the mountains creep
we moved towards our home where in this mood
each from the other sought refuge in solitude


what thoughts had sway oer cythnas lonely slumber
that night i know not but my own did seem
as if they might ten thousand years outnumber
of waking life the visions of a dream
which hid in one dim gulf the troubled stream
of mind a boundless chaos wild and vast
whose limits yet were never memorys theme
and i lay struggling as its whirlwinds passed
sometimes for rapture sick sometimes for pain aghast


two hours whose mighty circle did embrace
more time than might make gray the infant world
rolled thus a weary and tumultuous space
when the third came like mist on breezes curled
from my dim sleep a shadow was unfurled
methought upon the threshold of a cave
i sate with cythna drooping briony pearled
with dew from the wild streamlets shattered wave
hung where we sate to taste the joys which nature gave


we lived a day as we were wont to live
but nature had a robe of glory on
and the bright air oer every shape did weave
intenser hues so that the herbless stone
the leafless bough among the leaves alone
had being clearer than its own could be
and cythnas pure and radiant self was shown
in this strange vision so divine to me
that if i loved before now love was agony


morn fled noon came evening then night descended
and we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere
of the calm moonwhen suddenly was blended
with our repose a nameless sense of fear
and from the cave behind i seemed to hear
sounds gathering upwardsaccents incomplete
and stifled shrieksand now more near and near
a tumult and a rush of thronging feet
the caverns secret depths beneath the earth did beat


the scene was changed and away away away
through the air and over the sea we sped
and cythna in my sheltering bosom lay
and the winds bore methrough the darkness spread
around the gaping earth then vomited
legions of foul and ghastly shapes which hung
upon my flight and ever as we fled
they plucked at cythnasoon to me then clung
a sense of actual things those monstrous dreams among


and i lay struggling in the impotence
of sleep while outward life had burst its bound
though still deluded strove the tortured sense
to its dire wanderings to adapt the sound
which in the light of morn was poured around
our dwelling breathless pale and unaware
i rose and all the cottage crowded found
with armed men whose glittering swords were bare
and whose degraded limbs the tyrants garb did wear


and ere with rapid lips and gathered brow
i could demand the causea feeble shriek
it was a feeble shriek faint far and low
arrested memy mien grew calm and meek
and grasping a small knife i went to seek
that voice among the crowdtwas cythnas cry
beneath most calm resolve did agony wreak
its whirlwind rageso i passed quietly
till i beheld where bound that dearest child did lie


i started to behold her for delight
and exultation and a joyance free
solemn serene and lofty filled the light
of the calm smile with which she looked on me
so that i feared some brainless ecstasy
wrought from that bitter woe had wildered her
farewell farewell she said as i drew nigh
at first my peace was marred by this strange stir
now i am calm as truthits chosen minister


look not so laonsay farewell in hope
these bloody men are but the slaves who bear
their mistress to her taskit was my scope
the slavery where they drag me now to share
and among captives willing chains to wear
awhilethe rest thou knowestreturn dear friend
let our first triumph trample the despair
which would ensnare us now for in the end
in victory or in death our hopes and fears must blend


these words had fallen on my unheeding ear
whilst i had watched the motions of the crew
with seemingcareless glance not many were
around her for their comrades just withdrew
to guard some other victimso i drew
my knife and with one impulse suddenly
all unaware three of their number slew
and grasped a fourth by the throat and with loud cry
my countrymen invoked to death or liberty


what followed then i know notfor a stroke
on my raised arm and naked head came down
filling my eyes with bloodwhen i awoke
i felt that they had bound me in my swoon
and up a rock which overhangs the town
by the steep path were bearing me below
the plain was filled with slaughteroverthrown
the vineyards and the harvests and the glow
of blazing roofs shone far oer the white oceans flow


upon that rock a mighty column stood
whose capital seemed sculptured in the sky
which to the wanderers oer the solitude
of distant seas from ages long gone by
had made a landmark oer its height to fly
scarcely the cloud the vulture or the blast
has powerand when the shades of evening lie
on earth and ocean its carved summits cast
the sunken daylight far through the aerial waste


they bore me to a cavern in the hill
beneath that column and unbound me there
and one did strip me stark and one did fill
a vessel from the putrid pool one bare
a lighted torch and four with friendless care
guided my steps the cavernpaths along
then up a steep and dark and narrow stair
we wound until the torchs fiery tongue
amid the gushing day beamless and pallid hung


they raised me to the platform of the pile
that columns dizzy heightthe grate of brass
through which they thrust me open stood the while
as to its ponderous and suspended mass
with chains which eat into the flesh alas
with brazen links my naked limbs they bound
the grate as they departed to repass
with horrid clangour fell and the far sound
of their retiring steps in the dense gloom was drowned


the noon was calm and brightaround that column
the overhanging sky and circling sea
spread forth in silentness profound and solemn
the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me
so that i knew not my own misery
the islands and the mountains in the day
like clouds reposed afar and i could see
the town among the woods below that lay
and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay


it was so calm that scarce the feathery weed
sown by some eagle on the topmost stone
swayed in the airso bright that noon did breed
no shadow in the sky beside mine own
mine and the shadow of my chain alone
below the smoke of roofs involved in flame
rested like night all else was clearly shown
in that broad glare yet sound to me none came
but of the living blood that ran within my frame


the peace of madness fled and ah too soon
a ship was lying on the sunny main
its sails were flagging in the breathless noon
its shadow lay beyondthat sight again
waked with its presence in my tranced brain
the stings of a known sorrow keen and cold
i knew that ship bore cythna oer the plain
of waters to her blighting slavery sold
and watched it with such thoughts as must remain untold


i watched until the shades of evening wrapped
earth like an exhalationthen the bark
moved for that calm was by the sunset snapped
it moved a speck upon the ocean dark
soon the wan stars came forth and i could mark
its path no morei sought to close mine eyes
but like the balls their lids were stiff and stark
i would have risen but ere that i could rise
my parched skin was split with piercing agonies


i gnawed my brazen chain and sought to sever
its adamantine links that i might die
o liberty forgive the base endeavour
forgive me if reserved for victory
the champion of thy faith eer sought to fly
that starry night with its clear silence sent
tameless resolve which laughed at misery
into my soullinked remembrance lent
to that such power to me such a severe content


to breathe to be to hope or to despair
and die i questioned not nor though the sun
its shafts of agony kindling through the air
moved over me nor though in evening dun
or when the stars their visible courses run
or morning the wide universe was spread
in dreary calmness round me did i shun
its presence nor seek refuge with the dead
from one faint hope whose flower a dropping poison shed


two days thus passedi neither raved nor died
thirst raged within me like a scorpions nest
built in mine entrails i had spurned aside
the watervessel while despair possessed
my thoughts and now no drop remained the uprest
of the third sun brought hungerbut the crust
which had been left was to my craving breast
fuel not food i chewed the bitter dust
and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust


my brain began to fail when the fourth morn
burst oer the golden islesa fearful sleep
which through the caverns dreary and forlorn
of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep
with whirlwind swiftnessa fall far and deep
a gulf a void a sense of senselessness
these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep
their watch in some dim charnels loneliness
a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless


the forms which peopled this terrific trance
i well rememberlike a choir of devils
around me they involved a giddy dance
legions seemed gathering from the misty levels
of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels
foul ceaseless shadowsthought could not divide
the actual world from these entangling evils
which so bemocked themselves that i descried
all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied


the sense of day and night of false and true
was dead within me yet two visions burst
that darknessone as since that hour i knew
was not a phantom of the realms accursed
where then my spirit dweltbut of the first
i know not yet was it a dream or no
but both though not distincter were immersed
in hues which when through memorys waste they flow
make their divided streams more bright and rapid now


methought that grate was lifted and the seven
who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare
and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven
hung them on high by the entangled hair
swarthy were threethe fourth was very fair
as they retired the golden moon upsprung
and eagerly out in the giddy air
leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung
over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung


a womans shape now lank and cold and blue
the dwelling of the manycoloured worm
hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew
to my dry lipswhat radiance did inform
those horny eyes whose was that withered form
alas alas it seemed that cythnas ghost
laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm
within my teetha whirlwind keen as frost
then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed


then seemed it that a tameless hurricane
arose and bore me in its dark career
beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane
on the verge of formless spaceit languished there
and dying left a silence lone and drear
more horrible than faminein the deep
the shape of an old man did then appear
stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep
his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep


and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw
that column and those corpses and the moon
and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw
my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon
of senseless death would be accorded soon
when from that stony gloom a voice arose
solemn and sweet as when low winds attune
the midnight pines the grate did then unclose
and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose


he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled
as they were loosened by that hermit old
mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled
to answer those kind looks he did enfold
his giant arms around me to uphold
my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound
in linen moist and balmy and as cold
as dew to drooping leavesthe chain with sound
like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound


as lifting me it fellwhat next i heard
were billows leaping on the harbourbar
and the shrill seawind whose breath idly stirred
my hairi looked abroad and saw a star
shining beside a sail and distant far
that mountain and its column the known mark
of those who in the wide deep wandering are
so that i feared some spirit fell and dark
in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark


for now indeed over the salt seabillow
i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape
of him who ruled the helm although the pillow
for my light head was hollowed in his lap
and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap
fearing it was a fiend at last he bent
oer me his aged face as if to snap
those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent
and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent


a soft and healing potion to my lips
at intervals he raisednow looked on high
to mark if yet the starry giant dips
his zone in the dim seanow cheeringly
though he said little did he speak to me
it is a friend beside theetake good cheer
poor victim thou art now at liberty
i joyed as those a human tone to hear
who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year


a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft
were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams
yet still methought we sailed until aloft
the stars of night grew pallid and the beams
of morn descended on the oceanstreams
and still that aged man so grand and mild
tended me even as some sick mother seems
to hang in hope over a dying child
till in the azure east darkness again was piled


and then the nightwind steaming from the shore
sent odours dying sweet across the sea
and the swift boat the little waves which bore
were cut by its keen keel though slantingly
soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see
the myrtleblossoms starring the dim grove
as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee
on sidelong wing into a silent cove
where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove


the old man took the oars and soon the bark
smote on the beach beside a tower of stone
it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark
with blooming ivytrails was overgrown
upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown
and rarest seashells which the eternal flood
slave to the mother of the months had thrown
within the walls of that gray tower which stood
a changeling of mans art nursed amid natures brood


when the old man his boat had anchored
he wound me in his arms with tender care
and very few but kindly words he said
and bore me through the tower adown a stair
whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear
for many a year had fallenwe came at last
to a small chamber which with mosses rare
was tapestried where me his soft hands placed
upon a couch of grass and oakleaves interlaced


the moon was darting through the lattices
its yellow light warm as the beams of day
so warm that to admit the dewy breeze
the old man opened them the moonlight lay
upon a lake whose waters wove their play
even to the threshold of that lonely home
within was seen in the dim wavering ray
the antique sculptured roof and many a tome
whose lore had made that sage all that he had become


the rockbuilt barrier of the sea was past
and i was on the margin of a lake
a lonely lake amid the forests vast
and snowy mountainsdid my spirit wake
from sleep as manycoloured as the snake
that girds eternity in life and truth
might not my heart its cravings ever slake
was cythna then a dream and all my youth
and all its hopes and fears and all its joy and ruth


thus madness came againa milder madness
which darkened nought but times unquiet flow
with supernatural shades of clinging sadness
that gentle hermit in my helpless woe
by my sick couch was busy to and fro
like a strong spirit ministrant of good
when i was healed he led me forth to show
the wonders of his sylvan solitude
and we together sate by that islefretted flood


he knew his soothing words to weave with skill
from all my madness told like mine own heart
of cythna would he question me until
that thrilling name had ceased to make me start
from his familiar lipsit was not art
of wisdom and of justice when he spoke
when mid soft looks of pity there would dart
a glance as keen as is the lightnings stroke
when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak


thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled
my thoughts their due array did reassume
through the enchantments of that hermit old
then i bethought me of the glorious doom
of those who sternly struggle to relume
the lamp of hope oer mans bewildered lot
and sitting by the waters in the gloom
of eve to that friends heart i told my thought
that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not


that hoary man had spent his livelong age
in converse with the dead who leave the stamp
of everburning thoughts on many a page
when they are gone into the senseless damp
of graveshis spirit thus became a lamp
of splendour like to those on which it fed
through peopled haunts the city and the camp
deep thirst for knowledge had his footsteps led
and all the ways of men among mankind he read


but custom maketh blind and obdurate
the loftiest heartshe had beheld the woe
in which mankind was bound but deemed that fate
which made them abject would preserve them so
and in such faith some steadfast joy to know
he sought this cell but when fame went abroad
that one in argolis did undergo
torture for liberty and that the crowd
high truths from gifted lips had heard and understood


and that the multitude was gathering wide
his spirit leaped within his aged frame
in lonely peace he could no more abide
but to the land on which the victors flame
had fed my native land the hermit came
each heart was there a shield and every tongue
was as a sword of truthyoung laons name
rallied their secret hopes though tyrants sung
hymns of triumphant joy our scattered tribes among


he came to the lone column on the rock
and with his sweet and mighty eloquence
the hearts of those who watched it did unlock
and made them melt in tears of penitence
they gave him entrance free to bear me thence
since this the old man said seven years are spent
while slowly truth on thy benighted sense
has crept the hope which wildered it has lent
meanwhile to me the power of a sublime intent


yes from the records of my youthful state
and from the lore of bards and sages old
from whatsoeer my wakened thoughts create
out of the hopes of thine aspirings bold
have i collected language to unfold
truth to my countrymen from shore to shore
doctrines of human power my words have told
they have been heard and men aspire to more
than they have ever gained or ever lost of yore


in secret chambers parents read and weep
my writings to their babes no longer blind
and young men gather when their tyrants sleep
and vows of faith each to the other bind
and marriageable maidens who have pined
with love till life seemed melting through their look
a warmer zeal a nobler hope now find
and every bosom thus is rapt and shook
like autumns myriad leaves in one swoln mountainbrook


the tyrants of the golden city tremble
at voices which are heard about the streets
the ministers of fraud can scarce dissemble
the lies of their own heart but when one meets
another at the shrine he inly weets
though he says nothing that the truth is known
murderers are pale upon the judgementseats
and gold grows vile even to the wealthy crone
and laughter fills the fane and curses shake the throne


kind thoughts and mighty hopes and gentle deeds
abound for fearless love and the pure law
of mild equality and peace succeeds
to faiths which long have held the world in awe
bloody and false and coldas whirlpools draw
all wrecks of ocean to their chasm the sway
of thy strong genius laon which foresaw
this hope compels all spirits to obey
which round thy secret strength now throng in wide array


for i have been thy passive instrument
as thus the old man spake his countenance
gleamed on me like a spiritsthou hast lent
to me to all the power to advance
towards this unforeseen deliverance
from our ancestral chainsay thou didst rear
that lamp of hope on high which time nor chance
nor change may not extinguish and my share
of good was oer the world its gathered beams to bear


but i alas am both unknown and old
and though the woof of wisdom i know well
to dye in hues of language i am cold
in seeming and the hopes which inly dwell
my manners note that i did long repel
but laons name to the tumultuous throng
were like the star whose beams the waves compel
and tempests and his soulsubduing tongue
were as a lance to quell the mailed crest of wrong


perchance blood need not flow if thou at length
wouldst rise perchance the very slaves would spare
their brethren and themselves great is the strength
of wordsfor lately did a maiden fair
who from her childhood has been taught to bear
the tyrants heaviest yoke arise and make
her sex the law of truth and freedom hear
and with these quiet wordsfor thine own sake
i prithee spare medid with ruth so take


all hearts that even the torturer who had bound
her meek calm frame ere it was yet impaled
loosened her weeping then nor could be found
one human hand to harm herunassailed
therefore she walks through the great city veiled
in virtues adamantine eloquence
gainst scorn and death and pain thus trebly mailed
and blending in the smiles of that defence
the serpent and the dove wisdom and innocence


the wildeyed women throng around her path
from their luxurious dungeons from the dust
of meaner thralls from the oppressors wrath
or the caresses of his sated lust
they congregatein her they put their trust
the tyrants send their armed slaves to quell
her powerthey even like a thundergust
caught by some forest bend beneath the spell
of that young maidens speech and to their chiefs rebel


thus she doth equal laws and justice teach
to woman outraged and polluted long
gathering the sweetest fruit in human reach
for those fair hands now free while armed wrong
trembles before her look though it be strong
thousands thus dwell beside her virgins bright
and matrons with their babes a stately throng
lovers renew the vows which they did plight
in early faith and hearts long parted now unite


and homeless orphans find a home near her
and those poor victims of the proud no less
fair wrecks on whom the smiling world with stir
thrusts the redemption of its wickedness
in squalid huts and in its palaces
sits lust alone while oer the land is borne
her voice whose awful sweetness doth repress
all evil and her foes relenting turn
and cast the vote of love in hopes abandoned urn


so in the populous city a young maiden
has baffled havoc of the prey which he
marks as his own wheneer with chains oerladen
men make them arms to hurl down tyranny
false arbiter between the bound and free
and oer the land in hamlets and in towns
the multitudes collect tumultuously
and throng in arms but tyranny disowns
their claim and gathers strength around its trembling thrones


blood soon although unwillingly to shed
the free cannot forbearthe queen of slaves
the hoodwinked angel of the blind and dead
custom with iron mace points to the graves
where her own standard desolately waves
over the dust of prophets and of kings
many yet stand in her arrayshe paves
her path with human hearts and oer it flings
the wildering gloom of her immeasurable wings


there is a plain beneath the citys wall
bounded by misty mountains wide and vast
millions there lift at freedoms thrilling call
ten thousand standards wide they load the blast
which bears one sound of many voices past
and startles on his throne their sceptred foe
he sits amid his idle pomp aghast
and that his power hath passed away doth know
why pause the victor swords to seal his overthrow


the tyrants guards resistance yet maintain
fearless and fierce and hard as beasts of blood
they stand a speck amid the peopled plain
carnage and ruin have been made their food
from infancyill has become their good
and for its hateful sake their will has wove
the chains which eat their hearts the multitude
surrounding them with words of human love
seek from their own decay their stubborn minds to move


over the land is felt a sudden pause
as night and day those ruthless bands around
the watch of love is kepta trance which awes
the thoughts of men with hope as when the sound
of whirlwind whose fierce blasts the waves and clouds confound
dies suddenly the mariner in fear
feels silence sink upon his heartthus bound
the conquerors pause and oh may freemen neer
clasp the relentless knees of dread the murderer


if blood be shed tis but a change and choice
of bondsfrom slavery to cowardice
a wretched falluplift thy charmed voice
pour on those evil men the love that lies
hovering within those spiritsoothing eyes
arise my friend farewellas thus he spake
from the green earth lightly i did arise
as one out of dim dreams that doth awake
and looked upon the depth of that reposing lake


i saw my countenance reflected there
and then my youth fell on me like a wind
descending on still watersmy thin hair
was prematurely gray my face was lined
with channels such as suffering leaves behind
not age my brow was pale but in my cheek
and lips a flush of gnawing fire did find
their food and dwelling though mine eyes might speak
a subtle mind and strong within a frame thus weak


and though their lustre now was spent and faded
yet in my hollow looks and withered mien
the likeness of a shape for which was braided
the brightest woof of genius still was seen
one who methought had gone from the worlds scene
and left it vacanttwas her lovers face
it might resemble herit once had been
the mirror of her thoughts and still the grace
which her minds shadow cast left there a lingering trace


what then was i she slumbered with the dead
glory and joy and peace had come and gone
doth the cloud perish when the beams are fled
which steeped its skirts in gold or dark and lone
doth it not through the paths of night unknown
on outspread wings of its own wind upborne
pour rain upon the earth the stars are shown
when the cold moon sharpens her silver horn
under the sea and make the wide night not forlorn


strengthened in heart yet sad that aged man
i left with interchange of looks and tears
and lingering speech and to the camp began
my war oer many a mountainchain which rears
its hundred crests aloft my spirit bears
my frame oer many a dale and many a moor
and gaily now meseems serene earth wears
the blosmy springs starbright investiture
a vision which aught sad from sadness might allure


my powers revived within me and i went
as one whom winds waft oer the bending grass
through many a vale of that broad continent
at night when i reposed fair dreams did pass
before my pillowmy own cythna was
not like a child of death among them ever
when i arose from rest a woful mass
that gentlest sleep seemed from my life to sever
as if the light of youth were not withdrawn for ever


aye as i went that maiden who had reared
the torch of truth afar of whose high deeds
the hermit in his pilgrimage had heard
haunted my thoughtsah hope its sickness feeds
with whatsoeer it finds or flowers or weeds
could she be cythnawas that corpse a shade
such as selftorturing thought from madness breeds
why was this hope not torture yet it made
a light around my steps which would not ever fade


over the utmost hill at length i sped
a snowy steepthe moon was hanging low
over the asian mountains and outspread
the plain the city and the camp below
skirted the midnight oceans glimmering flow
the citys moonlit spires and myriad lamps
like stars in a sublunar sky did glow
and fires blazed far amid the scattered camps
like springs of flame which burst whereer swift earthquake stamps


all slept but those in watchful arms who stood
and those who sate tending the beacons light
and the few sounds from that vast multitude
made silence more profoundoh what a might
of human thought was cradled in that night
how many hearts impenetrably veiled
beat underneath its shade what secret fight
evil and good in woven passions mailed
waged through that silent thronga war that never failed


and now the power of good held victory
so through the labyrinth of many a tent
among the silent millions who did lie
in innocent sleep exultingly i went
the moon had left heaven desert now but lent
from eastern morn the first faint lustre showed
an armed youthover his spear he bent
his downward facea friend i cried aloud
and quickly common hopes made freemen understood


i sate beside him while the morning beam
crept slowly over heaven and talked with him
of those immortal hopes a glorious theme
which led us forth until the stars grew dim
and all the while methought his voice did swim
as if it drowned in remembrance were
of thoughts which make the moist eyes overbrim
at last when daylight gan to fill the air
he looked on me and cried in wonderthou art here


then suddenly i knew it was the youth
in whom its earliest hopes my spirit found
but envious tongues had stained his spotless truth
and thoughtless pride his love in silence bound
and shame and sorrow mine in toils had wound
whilst he was innocent and i deluded
the truth now came upon me on the ground
tears of repenting joy which fast intruded
fell fast and oer its peace our mingling spirits brooded


thus while with rapid lips and earnest eyes
we talked a sound of sweeping conflict spread
as from the earth did suddenly arise
from every tent roused by that clamour dread
our bands outsprung and seized their armswe sped
towards the sound our tribes were gathering far
those sanguine slaves amid ten thousand dead
stabbed in their sleep trampled in treacherous war
the gentle hearts whose power their lives had sought to spare


like rabid snakes that sting some gentle child
who brings them food when winter false and fair
allures them forth with its cold smiles so wild
they rage among the campthey overbear
the patriot hostsconfusion then despair
descends like nightwhen laon one did cry
like a bright ghost from heaven that shout did scare
the slaves and widening through the vaulted sky
seemed sent from earth to heaven in sign of victory


in sudden panic those false murderers fled
like insect tribes before the northern gale
but swifter still our hosts encompassed
their shattered ranks and in a craggy vale
where even their fierce despair might nought avail
hemmed them aroundand then revenge and fear
made the high virtue of the patriots fail
one pointed on his foe the mortal spear
i rushed before its point and cried forbear forbear


the spear transfixed my arm that was uplifted
in swift expostulation and the blood
gushed round its point i smiled andoh thou gifted
with eloquence which shall not be withstood
flow thus i cried in joy thou vital flood
until my heart be dry ere thus the cause
for which thou wert aught worthy be subdued
ah ye are paleye weepyour passions pause
tis well ye feel the truth of loves benignant laws


soldiers our brethren and our friends are slain
ye murdered them i think as they did sleep
alas what have ye done the slightest pain
which ye might suffer there were eyes to weep
but ye have quenched themthere were smiles to steep
your hearts in balm but they are lost in woe
and those whom love did set his watch to keep
around your tents truths freedom to bestow
ye stabbed as they did sleepbut they forgive ye now


oh wherefore should ill ever flow from ill
and pain still keener pain for ever breed
we all are brethreneven the slaves who kill
for hire are men and to avenge misdeed
on the misdoer doth but misery feed
with her own broken heart o earth o heaven
and thou dread nature which to every deed
and all that lives or is to be hath given
even as to thee have these done ill and are forgiven


join then your hands and hearts and let the past
be as a grave which gives not up its dead
to evil thoughtsa film then overcast
my sense with dimness for the wound which bled
freshly swift shadows oer mine eyes had shed
when i awoke i lay mid friends and foes
and earnest countenances on me shed
the light of questioning looks whilst one did close
my wound with balmiest herbs and soothed me to repose


and one whose spear had pierced me leaned beside
with quivering lips and humid eyesand all
seemed like some brothers on a journey wide
gone forth whom now strange meeting did befall
in a strange land round one whom they might call
their friend their chief their father for assay
of peril which had saved them from the thrall
of death now suffering thus the vast array
of those fraternal bands were reconciled that day


lifting the thunder of their acclamation
towards the city then the multitude
and i among them went in joya nation
made free by lovea mighty brotherhood
linked by a jealous interchange of good
a glorious pageant more magnificent
than kingly slaves arrayed in gold and blood
when they return from carnage and are sent
in triumph bright beneath the populous battlement


afar the citywalls were thronged on high
and myriads on each giddy turret clung
and to each spire far lessening in the sky
bright pennons on the idle winds were hung
as we approached a shout of joyance sprung
at once from all the crowd as if the vast
and peopled earth its boundless skies among
the sudden clamour of delight had cast
when from before its face some general wreck had passed


our armies through the citys hundred gates
were poured like brooks which to the rocky lair
of some deep lake whose silence them awaits
throng from the mountains when the storms are there
and as we passed through the calm sunny air
a thousand flowerinwoven crowns were shed
the token flowers of truth and freedom fair
and fairest hands bound them on many a head
those angels of loves heaven that over all was spread


i trod as one tranced in some rapturous vision
those bloody bands so lately reconciled
were ever as they went by the contrition
of anger turned to love from ill beguiled
and every one on them more gently smiled
because they had done evilthe sweet awe
of such mild looks made their own hearts grow mild
and did with soft attraction ever draw
their spirits to the love of freedoms equal law


and they and all in one loud symphony
my name with liberty commingling lifted
the friend and the preserver of the free
the parent of this joy and fair eyes gifted
with feelings caught from one who had uplifted
the light of a great spirit round me shone
and all the shapes of this grand scenery shifted
like restless clouds before the steadfast sun
where was that maid i asked but it was known of none


laone was the name her love had chosen
for she was nameless and her birth none knew
where was laone nowthe words were frozen
within my lips with fear but to subdue
such dreadful hope to my great task was due
and when at length one brought reply that she
tomorrow would appear i then withdrew
to judge what need for that great throng might be
for now the stars came thick over the twilight sea


yet need was none for rest or food to care
even though that multitude was passing great
since each one for the other did prepare
all kindly succourtherefore to the gate
of the imperial house now desolate
i passed and there was found aghast alone
the fallen tyrantsilently he sate
upon the footstool of his golden throne
which starred with sunny gems in its own lustre shone


alone but for one child who led before him
a graceful dance the only living thing
of all the crowd which thither to adore him
flocked yesterday who solace sought to bring
in his abandonmentshe knew the king
had praised her dance of yore and now she wove
its circles aye weeping and murmuring
mid her sad task of unregarded love
that to no smiles it might his speechless sadness move


she fled to him and wildly clasped his feet
when human steps were heardhe moved nor spoke
nor changed his hue nor raised his looks to meet
the gaze of strangersour loud entrance woke
the echoes of the hall which circling broke
the calm of its recesseslike a tomb
its sculptured walls vacantly to the stroke
of footfalls answered and the twilights gloom
lay like a charnels mist within the radiant dome


the little child stood up when we came nigh
her lips and cheeks seemed very pale and wan
but on her forehead and within her eye
lay beauty which makes hearts that feed thereon
sick with excess of sweetness on the throne
she leanedthe king with gathered brow and lips
wreathed by long scorn did inly sneer and frown
with hue like that when some great painter dips
his pencil in the gloom of earthquake and eclipse


she stood beside him like a rainbow braided
within some storm when scarce its shadows vast
from the blue paths of the swift sun have faded
a sweet and solemn smile like cythnas cast
one moments light which made my heart beat fast
oer that childs parted lipsa gleam of bliss
a shade of vanished daysas the tears passed
which wrapped it even as with a fathers kiss
i pressed those softest eyes in trembling tenderness


the sceptred wretch then from that solitude
i drew and of his change compassionate
with words of sadness soothed his rugged mood
but he while pride and fear held deep debate
with sullen guile of illdissembled hate
glared on me as a toothless snake might glare
pity not scorn i felt though desolate
the desolator now and unaware
the curses which he mocked had caught him by the hair


i led him forth from that which now might seem
a gorgeous grave through portals sculptured deep
with imagery beautiful as dream
we went and left the shades which tend on sleep
over its unregarded gold to keep
their silent watchthe child trod faintingly
and as she went the tears which she did weep
glanced in the starlight wildered seemed she
and when i spake for sobs she could not answer me


at last the tyrant cried she hungers slave
stab her or give her breadit was a tone
such as sick fancies in a newmade grave
might hear i trembled for the truth was known
he with this child had thus been left alone
and neither had gone forth for foodbut he
in mingled pride and awe cowered near his throne
and she a nursling of captivity
knew nought beyond those walls nor what such change might be


and he was troubled at a charm withdrawn
thus suddenly that sceptres ruled no more
that even from gold the dreadful strength was gone
which once made all things subject to its power
such wonder seized him as if hour by hour
the past had come again and the swift fall
of one so great and terrible of yore
to desolateness in the hearts of all
like wonder stirred who saw such awful change befall


a mighty crowd such as the wide land pours
once in a thousand years now gathered round
the fallen tyrantlike the rush of showers
of hail in spring pattering along the ground
their many footsteps fell else came no sound
from the wide multitude that lonely man
then knew the burden of his change and found
concealing in the dust his visage wan
refuge from the keen looks which through his bosom ran


and he was faint withal i sate beside him
upon the earth and took that child so fair
from his weak arms that ill might none betide him
or herwhen food was brought to them her share
to his averted lips the child did bear
but when she saw he had enough she ate
and wept the whilethe lonely mans despair
hunger then overcame and of his state
forgetful on the dust as in a trance he sate


slowly the silence of the multitudes
passed as when far is heard in some lone dell
the gathering of a wind among the woods
and he is fallen they cry he who did dwell
like famine or the plague or aught more fell
among our homes is fallen the murderer
who slaked his thirsting soul as from a well
of blood and tears with ruin he is here
sunk in a gulf of scorn from which none may him rear


then was heardhe who judged let him be brought
to judgement blood for blood cries from the soil
on which his crimes have deep pollution wrought
shall othman only unavenged despoil
shall they who by the stress of grinding toil
wrest from the unwilling earth his luxuries
perish for crime while his foul blood may boil
or creep within his veins at willarise
and to high justice make her chosen sacrifice


what do ye seek what fear ye then i cried
suddenly starting forth that ye should shed
the blood of othmanif your hearts are tried
in the true love of freedom cease to dread
this one poor lonely manbeneath heaven spread
in purest light above us all through earth
maternal earth who doth her sweet smiles shed
for all let him go free until the worth
of human nature win from these a second birth


what call ye justice is there one who neer
in secret thought has wished anothers ill
are ye all pure let those stand forth who hear
and tremble not shall they insult and kill
if such they be their mild eyes can they fill
with the false anger of the hypocrite
alas such were not purethe chastened will
of virtue sees that justice is the light
of love and not revenge and terror and despite


the murmur of the people slowly dying
paused as i spake then those who near me were
cast gentle looks where the lone man was lying
shrouding his head which now that infant fair
clasped on her lap in silencethrough the air
sobs were then heard and many kissed my feet
in pitys madness and to the despair
of him whom late they cursed a solace sweet
his very victims broughtsoft looks and speeches meet


then to a home for his repose assigned
accompanied by the still throng he went
in silence where to soothe his rankling mind
some likeness of his ancient state was lent
and if his heart could have been innocent
as those who pardoned him he might have ended
his days in peace but his straight lips were bent
men said into a smile which guile portended
a sight with which that child like hope with fear was blended


twas midnight now the eve of that great day
whereon the many nations at whose call
the chains of earth like mist melted away
decreed to hold a sacred festival
a rite to attest the equality of all
who live so to their homes to dream or wake
all went the sleepless silence did recall
laone to my thoughts with hopes that make
the flood recede from which their thirst they seek to slake


the dawn flowed forth and from its purple fountains
i drank those hopes which make the spirit quail
as to the plain between the misty mountains
and the great city with a countenance pale
i wentit was a sight which might avail
to make men weep exulting tears for whom
now first from human power the reverend veil
was torn to see earth from her general womb
pour forth her swarming sons to a fraternal doom


to see far glancing in the misty morning
the signs of that innumerable host
to hear one sound of many made the warning
of earth to heaven from its free children tossed
while the eternal hills and the sea lost
in wavering light and starring the blue sky
the citys myriad spires of gold almost
with human joy made mute society
its witnesses with men who must hereafter be


to see like some vast island from the ocean
the altar of the federation rear
its pile i the midst a work which the devotion
of millions in one night created there
sudden as when the moonrise makes appear
strange clouds in the east a marble pyramid
distinct with steps that mighty shape did wear
the light of genius its still shadow hid
far ships to know its height the morning mists forbid


to hear the restless multitudes for ever
around the base of that great altar flow
as on some mountainislet burst and shiver
atlantic waves and solemnly and slow
as the wind bore that tumult to and fro
to feel the dreamlike music which did swim
like beams through floating clouds on waves below
falling in pauses from that altar dim
as silversounding tongues breathed an aerial hymn


to hear to see to live was on that morn
lethean joy so that all those assembled
cast off their memories of the past outworn
two only bosoms with their own life trembled
and mine was oneand we had both dissembled
so with a beating heart i went and one
who having much covets yet more resembled
a lost and dear possession which not won
he walks in lonely gloom beneath the noonday sun


to the great pyramid i came its stair
with female choirs was thronged the loveliest
among the free grouped with its sculptures rare
as i approached the mornings golden mist
which now the wonderstricken breezes kissed
with their cold lips fled and the summit shone
like athos seen from samothracia dressed
in earliest light by vintagers and one
sate there a female shape upon an ivory throne


a form most like the imagined habitant
of silver exhalations sprung from dawn
by winds which feed on sunrise woven to enchant
the faiths of men all mortal eyes were drawn
as famished mariners through strange seas gone
gaze on a burning watchtower by the light
of those divinest lineamentsalone
with thoughts which none could share from that fair sight
i turned in sickness for a veil shrouded her countenance bright


and neither did i hear the acclamations
which from brief silence bursting filled the air
with her strange name and mine from all the nations
which we they said in strength had gathered there
from the sleep of bondage nor the vision fair
of that bright pageantry beheldbut blind
and silent as a breathing corpse did fare
leaning upon my friend till like a wind
to fevered cheeks a voice flowed oer my troubled mind


like music of some minstrel heavenly gifted
to one whom fiends enthral this voice to me
scarce did i wish her veil to be uplifted
i was so calm and joyousi could see
the platform where we stood the statues three
which kept their marble watch on that high shrine
the multitudes the mountains and the sea
as when eclipse hath passed things sudden shine
to mens astonished eyes most clear and crystalline


at first laone spoke most tremulously
but soon her voice the calmness which it shed
gathered andthou art whom i sought to see
and thou art our first votary here she said
i had a dear friend once but he is dead
and of all those on the wide earth who breathe
thou dost resemble him alonei spread
this veil between us two that thou beneath
shouldst image one who may have been long lost in death


for this wilt thou not henceforth pardon me
yes but those joys which silence well requite
forbid replywhy men have chosen me
to be the priestess of this holiest rite
i scarcely know but that the floods of light
which flow over the world have borne me hither
to meet thee long most dear and now unite
thine hand with mine and may all comfort wither
from both the hearts whose pulse in joy now beat together


if our own will as others law we bind
if the foul worship trampled here we fear
if as ourselves we cease to love our kind
she paused and pointed upwardssculptured there
three shapes around her ivory throne appear
one was a giant like a child asleep
on a loose rock whose grasp crushed as it were
in dream sceptres and crowns and one did keep
its watchful eyes in doubt whether to smile or weep


a woman sitting on the sculptured disk
of the broad earth and feeding from one breast
a human babe and a young basilisk
her looks were sweet as heavens when loveliest
in autumn eves the third image was dressed
in white wings swift as clouds in winter skies
beneath his feet mongst ghastliest forms repressed
lay faith an obscene worm who sought to rise
while calmly on the sun he turned his diamond eyes


beside that image then i sate while she
stood mid the throngs which ever ebbed and flowed
like light amid the shadows of the sea
cast from one cloudless star and on the crowd
that touch which none who feels forgets bestowed
and whilst the sun returned the steadfast gaze
of the great image as oer heaven it glode
that rite had place it ceased when sunsets blaze
burned oer the isles all stood in joy and deep amaze
when in the silence of all spirits there
laones voice was felt and through the air
her thrilling gestures spoke most eloquently fair


calm art thou as yon sunset swift and strong
as newfledged eagles beautiful and young
that float among the blinding beams of morning
and underneath thy feet writhe faith and folly
custom and hell and mortal melancholy
hark the earth starts to hear the mighty warning
of thy voice sublime and holy


its free spirits here assembled
see thee feel thee know thee now
to thy voice their hearts have trembled
like ten thousand clouds which flow
with one wide wind as it flies
wisdom thy irresistible children rise
to hail thee and the elements they chain
and their own will to swell the glory of thy train


o spirit vast and deep as night and heaven
mother and soul of all to which is given
the light of life the loveliness of being
lo thou dost reascend the human heart
thy throne of power almighty as thou wert
in dreams of poets old grown pale by seeing
the shade of theenow millions start


to feel thy lightnings through them burning
nature or god or love or pleasure
or sympathy the sad tears turning
to mutual smiles a drainless treasure
descends amidst usscorn and hate
revenge and selfishness are desolate
a hundred nations swear that there shall be
pity and peace and love among the good and free


eldest of things divine equality
wisdom and love are but the slaves of thee
the angels of thy sway who pour around thee
treasures from all the cells of human thought
and from the stars and from the ocean brought
and the last living heart whose beatings bound thee
the powerful and the wise had sought
thy coming thou in light descending
oer the wide land which is thine own
like the spring whose breath is blending
all blasts of fragrance into one
comest upon the paths of men
earth bares her general bosom to thy ken
and all her children here in glory meet
to feed upon thy smiles and clasp thy sacred feet


my brethren we are free the plains and mountains
the gray seashore the forests and the fountains
are haunts of happiest dwellersman and woman
their common bondage burst may freely borrow
from lawless love a solace for their sorrow
for oft we still must weep since we are human
a stormy nights serenest morrow


whose showers are pitys gentle tears
whose clouds are smiles of those that die
like infants without hopes or fears
and whose beams are joys that lie
in blended hearts now holds dominion
the dawn of mind which upwards on a pinion
borne swift as sunrise far illumines space
and clasps this barren world in its own bright embrace


my brethren we are free the fruits are glowing
beneath the stars and the nightwinds are flowing
oer the ripe corn the birds and beasts are dreaming
never again may blood of bird or beast
stain with its venomous stream a human feast
to the pure skies in accusation steaming
avenging poisons shall have ceased
to feed disease and fear and madness
the dwellers of the earth and air
shall throng around our steps in gladness
seeking their food or refuge there
our toil from thought all glorious forms shall cull
to make this earth our home more beautiful
and science and her sister poesy
shall clothe in light the fields and cities of the free


victory victory to the prostrate nations
bear witness night and ye mute constellations
who gaze on us from your crystalline cars
thoughts have gone forth whose powers can sleep no more
victory victory earths remotest shore
regions which groan beneath the antarctic stars
the green lands cradled in the roar
of western waves and wildernesses
peopled and vast which skirt the oceans
where morning dyes her golden tresses
shall soon partake our high emotions
kings shall turn pale almighty fear
the fiendgod when our charmed name he hear
shall fade like shadow from his thousand fanes
while truth with joy enthroned oer his lost empire reigns


ere she had ceased the mists of night entwining
their dim woof floated oer the infinite throng
she like a spirit through the darkness shining
in tones whose sweetness silence did prolong
as if to lingering winds they did belong
poured forth her inmost soul a passionate speech
with wild and thrilling pauses woven among
which whoso heard was mute for it could teach
to rapture like her own all listening hearts to reach


her voice was as a mountain stream which sweeps
the withered leaves of autumn to the lake
and in some deep and narrow bay then sleeps
in the shadow of the shores as dead leaves wake
under the wave in flowers and herbs which make
those green depths beautiful when skies are blue
the multitude so moveless did partake
such living change and kindling murmurs flew
as oer that speechless calm delight and wonder grew


over the plain the throngs were scattered then
in groups around the fires which from the sea
even to the gorge of the first mountainglen
blazed wide and far the banquet of the free
was spread beneath many a dark cypresstree
beneath whose spires which swayed in the red flame
reclining as they ate of liberty
and hope and justice and laones name
earths children did a woof of happy converse frame


their feast was such as earth the general mother
pours from her fairest bosom when she smiles
in the embrace of autumnto each other
as when some parent fondly reconciles
her warring children she their wrath beguiles
with her own sustenance they relenting weep
such was this festival which from their isles
and continents and winds and oceans deep
all shapes might throng to share that fly or walk or creep


might share in peace and innocence for gore
or poison none this festal did pollute
but piled on high an overflowing store
of pomegranates and citrons fairest fruit
melons and dates and figs and many a root
sweet and sustaining and bright grapes ere yet
accursed fire their mild juice could transmute
into a mortal bane and brown corn set
in baskets with pure streams their thirsting lips they wet


laone had descended from the shrine
and every deepest look and holiest mind
fed on her form though now those tones divine
were silent as she passed she did unwind
her veil as with the crowds of her own kind
she mixed some impulse made my heart refrain
from seeking her that night so i reclined
amidst a group where on the utmost plain
a festal watchfire burned beside the dusky main


and joyous was our feast pathetic talk
and wit and harmony of choral strains
while far orion oer the waves did walk
that flow among the isles held us in chains
of sweet captivity which none disdains
who feels but when his zone grew dim in mist
which clothes the oceans bosom oer the plains
the multitudes went homeward to their rest
which that delightful day with its own shadow blessed


beside the dimness of the glimmering sea
weaving swift language from impassioned themes
with that dear friend i lingered who to me
so late had been restored beneath the gleams
of the silver stars and ever in soft dreams
of future love and peace sweet converse lapped
our willing fancies till the pallid beams
of the last watchfire fell and darkness wrapped
the waves and each bright chain of floating fire was snapped


and till we came even to the citys wall
and the great gate then none knew whence or why
disquiet on the multitudes did fall
and first one pale and breathless passed us by
and stared and spoke notthen with piercing cry
a troop of wildeyed women by the shrieks
of their own terror driventumultuously
hither and thither hurrying with pale cheeks
each one from fear unknown a sudden refuge seeks


then rallying cries of treason and of danger
resounded andthey come to arms to arms
the tyrant is amongst us and the stranger
comes to enslave us in his name to arms
in vain for panic the pale fiend who charms
strength to forswear her right those millions swept
like waves before the tempestthese alarms
came to me as to know their cause i lept
on the gates turret and in rage and grief and scorn i wept


for to the north i saw the town on fire
and its red light made morning pallid now
which burst over wide asialouder higher
the yells of victory and the screams of woe
i heard approach and saw the throng below
stream through the gates like foamwrought waterfalls
fed from a thousand stormsthe fearful glow
of bombs flares overheadat intervals
the red artillerys bolt mangling among them falls


and now the horsemen comeand all was done
swifter than i have spokeni beheld
their red swords flash in the unrisen sun
i rushed among the rout to have repelled
that miserable flightone moment quelled
by voice and looks and eloquent despair
as if reproach from their own hearts withheld
their steps they stood but soon came pouring there
new multitudes and did those rallied bands oerbear


i strove as drifted on some cataract
by irresistible streams some wretch might strive
who hears its fatal roarthe files compact
whelmed me and from the gate availed to drive
with quickening impulse as each bolt did rive
their ranks with bloodier chasminto the plain
disgorged at length the dead and the alive
in one dread mass were parted and the stain
of blood from mortal steel fell oer the fields like rain


for now the despots bloodhounds with their prey
unarmed and unaware were gorging deep
their gluttony of death the loose array
of horsemen oer the wide fields murdering sweep
and with loud laughter for their tyrant reap
a harvest sown with other hopes the while
far overhead ships from propontis keep
a killing rain of firewhen the waves smile
as sudden earthquakes light many a volcanoisle


thus sudden unexpected feast was spread
for the carrionfowls of heaveni saw the sight
i movedi livedas oer the heaps of dead
whose stony eyes glared in the morning light
i trodto me there came no thought of flight
but with loud cries of scorn which whoso heard
that dreaded death felt in his veins the might
of virtuous shame return the crowd i stirred
and desperations hope in many hearts recurred


a band of brothers gathering round me made
although unarmed a steadfast front and still
retreating with stern looks beneath the shade
of gathered eyebrows did the victors fill
with doubt even in success deliberate will
inspired our growing troop not overthrown
it gained the shelter of a grassy hill
and ever still our comrades were hewn down
and their defenceless limbs beneath our footsteps strown


immovably we stoodin joy i found
beside me then firm as a giant pine
among the mountainvapours driven around
the old man whom i lovedhis eyes divine
with a mild look of courage answered mine
and my young friend was near and ardently
his hand grasped mine a momentnow the line
of war extended to our rallying cry
as myriads flocked in love and brotherhood to die


for ever while the sun was climbing heaven
the horseman hewed our unarmed myriads down
safely though when by thirst of carnage driven
too near those slaves were swiftly overthrown
by hundreds leaping on themflesh and bone
soon made our ghastly ramparts then the shaft
of the artillery from the sea was thrown
more fast and fiery and the conquerors laughed
in pride to hear the wind our screams of torment waft


for on one side alone the hill gave shelter
so vast that phalanx of unconquered men
and there the living in the blood did welter
of the dead and dying which in that green glen
like stifled torrents made a plashy fen
under the feetthus was the butchery waged
while the sun clomb heavens eastern steepbut when
it gan to sinka fiercer combat raged
for in more doubtful strife the armies were engaged


within a cave upon the hill were found
a bundle of rude pikes the instrument
of those who war but on their native ground
for natural rights a shout of joyance sent
even from our hearts the wide air pierced and rent
as those few arms the bravest and the best
seized and each sixth thus armed did now present
a line which covered and sustained the rest
a confident phalanx which the foes on every side invest


that onset turned the foes to flight almost
but soon they saw their present strength and knew
that coming night would to our resolute host
bring victory so dismounting close they drew
their glittering files and then the combat grew
unequal but most horribleand ever
our myriads whom the swift bolt overthrew
or the red sword failed like a mountain river
which rushes forth in foam to sink in sands for ever


sorrow and shame to see with their own kind
our human brethren mix like beasts of blood
to mutual ruin armed by one behind
who sits and scoffsthat friend so mild and good
who like its shadow near my youth had stood
was stabbedmy old preservers hoary hair
with the flesh clinging to its roots was strewed
under my feeti lost all sense or care
and like the rest i grew desperate and unaware


the battle became ghastlierin the midst
i paused and saw how ugly and how fell
o hate thou art even when thy life thou sheddst
for love the ground in many a little dell
was broken up and down whose steeps befell
alternate victory and defeat and there
the combatants with rage most horrible
strove and their eyes started with cracking stare
and impotent their tongues they lolled into the air


flaccid and foamy like a mad dogs hanging
want and moonmadness and the pests swift bane
when its shafts smitewhile yet its bow is twanging
have each their mark and signsome ghastly stain
and this was thine o war of hate and pain
thou loathed slave i saw all shapes of death
and ministered to many oer the plain
while carnage in the sunbeams warmth did seethe
till twilight oer the east wove her serenest wreath


the few who yet survived resolute and firm
around me fought at the decline of day
winding above the mountains snowy term
new banners shone they quivered in the ray
of the suns unseen orbere night the array
of fresh troops hemmed us inof those brave bands
i soon survived aloneand now i lay
vanquished and faint the grasp of bloody hands
i felt and saw on high the glare of falling brands


when on my foes a sudden terror came
and they fled scatteringlo with reinless speed
a black tartarian horse of giant frame
comes trampling over the dead the living bleed
beneath the hoofs of that tremendous steed
on which like to an angel robed in white
sate one waving a swordthe hosts recede
and fly as through their ranks with awful might
sweeps in the shadow of eve that phantom swift and bright


and its path made a solitudei rose
and marked its coming it relaxed its course
as it approached me and the wind that flows
through night bore accents to mine ear whose force
might create smiles in deaththe tartar horse
paused and i saw the shape its might which swayed
and heard her musical pants like the sweet source
of waters in the desert as she said
mount with me laon nowi rapidly obeyed


then away away she cried and stretched her sword
as twere a scourge over the coursers head
and lightly shook the reinswe spake no word
but like the vapour of the tempest fled
over the plain her dark hair was dispread
like the pines locks upon the lingering blast
over mine eyes its shadowy strings it spread
fitfully and the hills and streams fled fast
as oer their glimmering forms the steeds broad shadow passed


and his hoofs ground the rocks to fire and dust
his strong sides made the torrents rise in spray
and turbulence as of a whirlwinds gust
surrounded usand still away away
through the desert night we sped while she alway
gazed on a mountain which we neared whose crest
crowned with a marble ruin in the ray
of the obscure stars gleamedits rugged breast
the steed strained up and then his impulse did arrest


a rocky hill which overhung the ocean
from that lone ruin when the steed that panted
paused might be heard the murmur of the motion
of waters as in spots for ever haunted
by the choicest winds of heaven which are enchanted
to music by the wand of solitude
that wizard wild and the far tents implanted
upon the plain be seen by those who stood
thence marking the dark shore of oceans curved flood


one moment these were heard and seenanother
passed and the two who stood beneath that night
each only heard or saw or felt the other
as from the lofty steed she did alight
cythna for from the eyes whose deepest light
of love and sadness made my lips feel pale
with influence strange of mournfullest delight
my own sweet cythna looked with joy did quail
and felt her strength in tears of human weakness fail


and for a space in my embrace she rested
her head on my unquiet heart reposing
while my faint arms her languid frame invested
at length she looked on me and half unclosing
her tremulous lips said friend thy bands were losing
the battle as i stood before the king
in bondsi burst them then and swiftly choosing
the time did seize a tartars sword and spring
upon his horse and swift as on the whirlwinds wing


have thou and i been borne beyond pursuer
and we are herethen turning to the steed
she pressed the white moon on his front with pure
and roselike lips and many a fragrant weed
from the green ruin plucked that he might feed
but i to a stone seat that maiden led
and kissing her fair eyes said thou hast need
of rest and i heaped up the coursers bed
in a green mossy nook with mountain flowers dispread


within that ruin where a shattered portal
looks to the eastern stars abandoned now
by man to be the home of things immortal
memories like awful ghosts which come and go
and must inherit all he builds below
when he is gone a hall stood oer whose roof
fair clinging weeds with ivy pale did grow
clasping its gray rents with a verdurous woof
a hanging dome of leaves a canopy moonproof


the autumnal winds as if spellbound had made
a natural couch of leaves in that recess
which seasons none disturbed but in the shade
of flowering parasites did spring love to dress
with their sweet blooms the wintry loneliness
of those dead leaves shedding their stars wheneer
the wandering wind her nurslings might caress
whose intertwining fingers ever there
made music wild and soft that filled the listening air


we know not where we go or what sweet dream
may pilot us through caverns strange and fair
of far and pathless passion while the stream
of life our bark doth on its whirlpools bear
spreading swift wings as sails to the dim air
nor should we seek to know so the devotion
of love and gentle thoughts be heard still there
louder and louder from the utmost ocean
of universal life attuning its commotion


to the pure all things are pure oblivion wrapped
our spirits and the fearful overthrow
of public hope was from our being snapped
though linked years had bound it there for now
a power a thirst a knowledge which below
all thoughts like light beyond the atmosphere
clothing its clouds with grace doth ever flow
came on us as we sate in silence there
beneath the golden stars of the clear azure air


in silence which doth follow talk that causes
the baffled heart to speak with sighs and tears
when wildering passion swalloweth up the pauses
of inexpressive speechthe youthful years
which we together passed their hopes and fears
the blood itself which ran within our frames
that likeness of the features which endears
the thoughts expressed by them our very names
and all the winged hours which speechless memory claims


had found a voiceand ere that voice did pass
the night grew damp and dim and through a rent
of the ruin where we sate from the morass
a wandering meteor by some wild wind sent
hung high in the green dome to which it lent
a faint and pallid lustre while the song
of blasts in which its blue hair quivering bent
strewed strangest sounds the moving leaves among
a wondrous light the sound as of a spirits tongue


the meteor showed the leaves on which we sate
and cythnas glowing arms and the thick ties
of her soft hair which bent with gathered weight
my neck near hers her dark and deepening eyes
which as twin phantoms of one star that lies
oer a dim well move though the star reposes
swam in our mute and liquid ecstasies
her marble brow and eager lips like roses
with their own fragrance pale which spring but half uncloses


the meteor to its far morass returned
the beating of our veins one interval
made still and then i felt the blood that burned
within her frame mingle with mine and fall
around my heart like fire and over all
a mist was spread the sickness of a deep
and speechless swoon of joy as might befall
two disunited spirits when they leap
in union from this earths obscure and fading sleep


was it one moment that confounded thus
all thought all sense all feeling into one
unutterable power which shielded us
even from our own cold looks when we had gone
into a wide and wild oblivion
of tumult and of tenderness or now
had ages such as make the moon and sun
the seasons and mankind their changes know
left fear and time unfelt by us alone below


i know not what are kisses whose fire clasps
the failing heart in languishment or limb
twined within limb or the quick dying gasps
of the life meeting when the faint eyes swim
through tears of a wide mist boundless and dim
in one caress what is the strong control
which leads the heart that dizzy steep to climb
where far over the world those vapours roll
which blend two restless frames in one reposing soul
it is the shadow which doth float unseen
but not unfelt oer blind mortality
whose divine darkness fled not from that green
and lone recess where lapped in peace did lie
our linked frames till from the changing sky
that night and still another day had fled
and then i saw and felt the moon was high
and clouds as of a coming storm were spread
under its orbloud winds were gathering overhead


cythnas sweet lips seemed lurid in the moon
her fairest limbs with the night wind were chill
and her dark tresses were all loosely strewn
oer her pale bosomall within was still
and the sweet peace of joy did almost fill
the depth of her unfathomable look
and we sate calmly though that rocky hill
the waves contending in its caverns strook
for they foreknew the storm and the gray ruin shook


there we unheeding sate in the communion
of interchanged vows which with a rite
of faith most sweet and sacred stamped our union
few were the living hearts which could unite
like ours or celebrate a bridal night
with such close sympathies for they had sprung
from linked youth and from the gentle might
of earliest love delayed and cherished long
which common hopes and fears made like a tempest strong


and such is natures law divine that those
who grow together cannot choose but love
if faith or custom do not interpose
or common slavery mar what else might move
all gentlest thoughts as in the sacred grove
which shades the springs of ethiopian nile
that living tree which if the arrowy dove
strike with her shadow shrinks in fear awhile
but its own kindred leaves clasps while the sunbeams smile


and clings to them when darkness may dissever
the close caresses of all duller plants
which bloom on the wide earththus we for ever
were linked for love had nursed us in the haunts
where knowledge from its secret source enchants
young hearts with the fresh music of its springing
ere yet its gathered flood feeds human wants
as the great nile feeds egypt ever flinging
light on the woven boughs which oer its waves are swinging


the tones of cythnas voice like echoes were
of those far murmuring streams they rose and fell
mixed with mine own in the tempestuous air
and so we sate until our talk befell
of the late ruin swift and horrible
and how those seeds of hope might yet be sown
whose fruit is evils mortal poison well
for us this ruin made a watchtower lone
but cythnas eyes looked faint and now two days were gone


since she had foodtherefore i did awaken
the tartar steed who from his ebon mane
soon as the clinging slumbers he had shaken
bent his thin head to seek the brazen rein
following me obediently with pain
of heart so deep and dread that one caress
when lips and heart refuse to part again
till they have told their fill could scarce express
the anguish of her mute and fearful tenderness


cythna beheld me part as i bestrode
that willing steedthe tempest and the night
which gave my path its safety as i rode
down the ravine of rocks did soon unite
the darkness and the tumult of their might
borne on all windsfar through the streaming rain
floating at intervals the garments white
of cythna gleamed and her voice once again
came to me on the gust and soon i reached the plain


i dreaded not the tempest nor did he
who bore me but his eyeballs wide and red
turned on the lightnings cleft exultingly
and when the earth beneath his tameless tread
shook with the sullen thunder he would spread
his nostrils to the blast and joyously
mock the fierce peal with neighingsthus we sped
oer the lit plain and soon i could descry
where death and fire had gorged the spoil of victory


there was a desolate village in a wood
whose bloominwoven leaves now scattering fed
the hungry storm it was a place of blood
a heap of hearthless wallsthe flames were dead
within those dwellings nowthe life had fled
from all those corpses nowbut the wide sky
flooded with lightning was ribbed overhead
by the black rafters and around did lie
women and babes and men slaughtered confusedly


beside the fountain in the marketplace
dismounting i beheld those corpses stare
with horny eyes upon each others face
and on the earth and on the vacant air
and upon me close to the waters where
i stooped to slake my thirsti shrank to taste
for the salt bitterness of blood was there
but tied the steed beside and sought in haste
if any yet survived amid that ghastly waste


no living thing was there beside one woman
whom i found wandering in the streets and she
was withered from a likeness of aught human
into a fiend by some strange misery
soon as she heard my steps she leaped on me
and glued her burning lips to mine and laughed
with a loud long and frantic laugh of glee
and cried now mortal thou hast deeply quaffed
the plagues blue kissessoon millions shall pledge the draught


my name is pestilencethis bosom dry
once fed two babesa sister and a brother
when i came home one in the blood did lie
of three deathwoundsthe flames had ate the other
since then i have no longer been a mother
but i am pestilencehither and thither
i flit about that i may slay and smother
all lips which i have kissed must surely wither
but deathsif thou art he well go to work together


what seekst thou here the moonlight comes in flashes
the dew is rising dankly from the dell
twill moisten her and thou shalt see the gashes
in my sweet boy now full of wormsbut tell
first what thou seeksti seek for foodtis well
thou shalt have food famine my paramour
waits for us at the feastcruel and fell
is famine but he drives not from his door
those whom these lips have kissed alone no more no more


as thus she spake she grasped me with the strength
of madness and by many a ruined hearth
she led and over many a corpseat length
we came to a lone hut where on the earth
which made its floor she in her ghastly mirth
gathering from all those homes now desolate
had piled three heaps of loaves making a dearth
among the deadround which she set in state
a ring of cold stiff babes silent and stark they sate


she leaped upon a pile and lifted high
her mad looks to the lightning and cried eat
share the great feasttomorrow we must die
and then she spurned the loaves with her pale feet
towards her bloodless gueststhat sight to meet
mine eyes and my heart ached and but that she
who loved me did with absent looks defeat
despair i might have raved in sympathy
but now i took the food that woman offered me


and vainly having with her madness striven
if i might win her to return with me
departed in the eastern beams of heaven
the lightning now grew pallidrapidly
as by the shore of the tempestuous sea
the dark steed bore me and the mountain gray
soon echoed to his hoofs and i could see
cythna among the rocks where she alway
had sate with anxious eyes fixed on the lingering day


and joy was ours to meet she was most pale
famished and wet and weary so i cast
my arms around her lest her steps should fail
as to our home we went and thus embraced
her full heart seemed a deeper joy to taste
than eer the prosperous know the steed behind
trod peacefully along the mountain waste
we reached our home ere morning could unbind
nights latest veil and on our bridalcouch reclined


her chilled heart having cherished in my bosom
and sweetest kisses past we two did share
our peaceful mealas an autumnal blossom
which spreads its shrunk leaves in the sunny air
after cold showers like rainbows woven there
thus in her lips and cheeks the vital spirit
mantled and in her eyes an atmosphere
of health and hope and sorrow languished near it
and fear and all that dark despondence doth inherit


so we sate joyous as the morning ray
which fed upon the wrecks of night and storm
now lingering on the winds light airs did play
among the dewy weeds the sun was warm
and we sate linked in the inwoven charm
of converse and caresses sweet and deep
speechless caresses talk that might disarm
time though he wield the darts of death and sleep
and those thrice mortal barbs in his own poison steep


i told her of my sufferings and my madness
and how awakened from that dreamy mood
by libertys uprise the strength of gladness
came to my spirit in my solitude
and all that now i waswhile tears pursued
each other down her fair and listening cheek
fast as the thoughts which fed them like a flood
from sunbright dales and when i ceased to speak
her accents soft and sweet the pausing air did wake


she told me a strange tale of strange endurance
like broken memories of many a heart
woven into one to which no firm assurance
so wild were they could her own faith impart
she said that not a tear did dare to start
from the swoln brain and that her thoughts were firm
when from all mortal hope she did depart
borne by those slaves across the oceans term
and that she reached the port without one fear infirm


one was she among many there the thralls
of the cold tyrants cruel lust and they
laughed mournfully in those polluted halls
but she was calm and sad musing alway
on loftiest enterprise till on a day
the tyrant heard her singing to her lute
a wild and sad and spiritthrilling lay
like winds that die in wastesone moment mute
the evil thoughts it made which did his breast pollute


even when he saw her wondrous loveliness
one moment to great natures sacred power
he bent and was no longer passionless
but when he bade her to his secret bower
be borne a loveless victim and she tore
her locks in agony and her words of flame
and mightier looks availed not then he bore
again his load of slavery and became
a king a heartless beast a pageant and a name


she told me what a loathsome agony
is that when selfishness mocks loves delight
foul as in dreams most fearful imagery
to dally with the mowing deadthat night
all torture fear or horror made seem light
which the soul dreams or knows and when the day
shone on her awful frenzy from the sight
where like a spirit in fleshly chains she lay
struggling aghast and pale the tyrant fled away


her madness was a beam of light a power
which dawned through the rent soul and words it gave
gestures and looks such as in whirlwinds bore
which might not be withstoodwhence none could save
all who approached their spherelike some calm wave
vexed into whirlpools by the chasms beneath
and sympathy made each attendant slave
fearless and free and they began to breathe
deep curses like the voice of flames far underneath


the king felt pale upon his noonday throne
at night two slaves he to her chamber sent
one was a green and wrinkled eunuch grown
from human shape into an instrument
of all things illdistorted bowed and bent
the other was a wretch from infancy
made dumb by poison who nought knew or meant
but to obey from the fire isles came he
a diver lean and strong of omans coral sea


they bore her to a bark and the swift stroke
of silent rowers clove the blue moonlight seas
until upon their path the morning broke
they anchored then where be there calm or breeze
the gloomiest of the drear symplegades
shakes with the sleepless surgethe ethiop there
wound his long arms around her and with knees
like iron clasped her feet and plunged with her
among the closing waves out of the boundless air


swift as an eagle stooping from the plain
of morning light into some shadowy wood
he plunged through the green silence of the main
through many a cavern which the eternal flood
had scooped as dark lairs for its monster brood
and among mighty shapes which fled in wonder
and among mightier shadows which pursued
his heels he wound until the dark rocks under
he touched a golden chaina sound arose like thunder


a stunning clang of massive bolts redoubling
beneath the deepa burst of waters driven
as from the roots of the sea raging and bubbling
and in that roof of crags a space was riven
through which there shone the emerald beams of heaven
shot through the lines of many waves inwoven
like sunlight through acacia woods at even
through which his way the diver having cloven
passed like a spark sent up out of a burning oven


and then she said he laid me in a cave
above the waters by that chasm of sea
a fountain round and vast in which the wave
imprisoned boiled and leaped perpetually
down which one moment resting he did flee
winning the adverse depth that spacious cell
like an hupaithric temple wide and high
whose aery dome is inaccessible
was pierced with one round cleft through which the sunbeams fell


below the fountains brink was richly paven
with the deeps wealth coral and pearl and sand
like spangling gold and purple shells engraven
with mystic legends by no mortal hand
left there when thronging to the moons command
the gathering waves rent the hesperian gate
of mountains and on such bright floor did stand
columns and shapes like statues and the state
of kingless thrones which earth did in her heart create


the fiend of madness which had made its prey
of my poor heart was lulled to sleep awhile
there was an interval of many a day
and a seaeagle brought me food the while
whose nest was built in that untrodden isle
and who to be the gaoler had been taught
of that strange dungeon as a friend whose smile
like light and rest at morn and even is sought
that wild bird was to me till madness misery brought


the misery of a madness slow and creeping
which made the earth seem fire the sea seem air
and the white clouds of noon which oft were sleeping
in the blue heaven so beautiful and fair
like hosts of ghastly shadows hovering there
and the seaeagle looked a fiend who bore
thy mangled limbs for foodthus all things were
transformed into the agony which i wore
even as a poisoned robe around my bosoms core


again i knew the day and night fast fleeing
the eagle and the fountain and the air
another frenzy camethere seemed a being
within mea strange load my heart did bear
as if some living thing had made its lair
even in the fountains of my lifea long
and wondrous vision wrought from my despair
then grew like sweet reality among
dim visionary woes an unreposing throng


methought i was about to be a mother
month after month went by and still i dreamed
that we should soon be all to one another
i and my child and still new pulses seemed
to beat beside my heart and still i deemed
there was a babe withinand when the rain
of winter through the rifted cavern streamed
methought after a lapse of lingering pain
i saw that lovely shape which near my heart had lain


it was a babe beautiful from its birth
it was like thee dear love its eyes were thine
its brow its lips and so upon the earth
it laid its fingers as now rest on mine
thine own belovedtwas a dream divine
even to remember how it fled how swift
how utterly might make the heart repine
though twas a dreamthen cythna did uplift
her looks on mine as if some doubt she sought to shift


a doubt which would not flee a tenderness
of questioning grief a source of thronging tears
which having passed as one whom sobs oppress
she spoke yes in the wilderness of years
her memory aye like a green home appears
she sucked her fill even at this breast sweet love
for many months i had no mortal fears
methought i felt her lips and breath approve
it was a human thing which to my bosom clove


i watched the dawn of her first smiles and soon
when zenith stars were trembling on the wave
or when the beams of the invisible moon
or sun from many a prism within the cave
their gemborn shadows to the water gave
her looks would hunt them and with outspread hand
from the swift lights which might that fountain pave
she would mark one and laugh when that command
slighting it lingered there and could not understand


methought her looks began to talk with me
and no articulate sounds but something sweet
her lips would frameso sweet it could not be
that it was meaningless her touch would meet
mine and our pulses calmly flow and beat
in response while we slept and on a day
when i was happiest in that strange retreat
with heaps of golden shells we two did play
both infants weaving wings for times perpetual way


ere night methought her waning eyes were grown
weary with joy and tired with our delight
we on the earth like sister twins lay down
on one fair mothers bosomfrom that night
she fledlike those illusions clear and bright
which dwell in lakes when the red moon on high
pause ere it wakens tempestand her flight
though twas the death of brainless fantasy
yet smote my lonesome heart more than all misery


it seemed that in the dreary night the diver
who brought me thither came again and bore
my child away i saw the waters quiver
when he so swiftly sunk as once before
then morning cameit shone even as of yore
but i was changedthe very life was gone
out of my hearti wasted more and more
day after day and sitting there alone
vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan


i was no longer mad and yet methought
my breasts were swoln and changedin every vein
the blood stood still one moment while that thought
was passingwith a gush of sickening pain
it ebbed even to its withered springs again
when my wan eyes in stern resolve i turned
from that most strange delusion which would fain
have waked the dream for which my spirit yearned
with more than human lovethen left it unreturned


so now my reason was restored to me
i struggled with that dream which like a beast
most fierce and beauteous in my memory
had made its lair and on my heart did feast
but all that cave and all its shapes possessed
by thoughts which could not fade renewed each one
some smile some look some gesture which had blessed
me heretofore i sitting there alone
vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan


time passed i know not whether months or years
for day nor night nor change of seasons made
its note but thoughts and unavailing tears
and i became at last even as a shade
a smoke a cloud on which the winds have preyed
till it be thin as air until one even
a nautilus upon the fountain played
spreading his azure sail where breath of heaven
descended not among the waves and whirlpools driven


and when the eagle came that lovely thing
oaring with rosy feet its silver boat
fled near me as for shelter on slow wing
the eagle hovering oer his prey did float
but when he saw that i with fear did note
his purpose proffering my own food to him
the eager plumes subsided on his throat
he came where that bright child of sea did swim
and oer it cast in peace his shadow broad and dim


this wakened me it gave me human strength
and hope i know not whence or wherefore rose
but i resumed my ancient powers at length
my spirit felt again like one of those
like thine whose fate it is to make the woes
of humankind their preywhat was this cave
its deep foundation no firm purpose knows
immutable resistless strong to save
like mind while yet it mocks the alldevouring grave


and where was laon might my heart be dead
while that far dearer heart could move and be
or whilst over the earth the pall was spread
which i had sworn to rend i might be free
could i but win that friendly bird to me
to bring me ropes and long in vain i sought
by intercourse of mutual imagery
of objects if such aid he could be taught
but fruit and flowers and boughs yet never ropes he brought


we live in our own world and mine was made
from glorious fantasies of hope departed
aye we are darkened with their floating shade
or cast a lustre on themtime imparted
such power to mei became fearlesshearted
my eye and voice grew firm calm was my mind
and piercing like the morn now it has darted
its lustre on all hidden things behind
yon dim and fading clouds which load the weary wind


my mind became the book through which i grew
wise in all human wisdom and its cave
which like a mine i rifled through and through
to me the keeping of its secrets gave
one mind the type of all the moveless wave
whose calm reflects all moving things that are
necessity and love and life the grave
and sympathy fountains of hope and fear
justice and truth and time and the worlds natural sphere


and on the sand would i make signs to range
these woofs as they were woven of my thought
clear elemental shapes whose smallest change
a subtler language within language wrought
the key of truths which once were dimly taught
in old crotonaand sweet melodies
of love in that lorn solitude i caught
from mine own voice in dream when thy dear eyes
shone through my sleep and did that utterance harmonize


thy songs were winds whereon i fled at will
as in a winged chariot oer the plain
of crystal youth and thou wert there to fill
my heart with joy and there we sate again
on the gray margin of the glimmering main
happy as then but wiser far for we
smiled on the flowery grave in which were lain
fear faith and slavery and mankind was free
equal and pure and wise in wisdoms prophecy


for to my will my fancies were as slaves
to do their sweet and subtile ministries
and oft from that bright fountains shadowy waves
they would make human throngs gather and rise
to combat with my overflowing eyes
and voice made deep with passionthus i grew
familiar with the shock and the surprise
and war of earthly minds from which i drew
the power which has been mine to frame their thoughts anew


and thus my prison was the populous earth
where i saweven as misery dreams of morn
before the east has given its glory birth
religions pomp made desolate by the scorn
of wisdoms faintest smile and thrones uptorn
and dwellings of mild people interspersed
with undivided fields of ripening corn
and love made freea hope which we have nursed
even with our blood and tearsuntil its glory burst


all is not lost there is some recompense
for hope whose fountain can be thus profound
even throned evils splendid impotence
girt by its hell of power the secret sound
of hymns to truth and freedomthe dread bound
of life and death passed fearlessly and well
dungeons wherein the high resolve is found
racks which degraded womans greatness tell
and what may else be good and irresistible


such are the thoughts which like the fires that flare
in stormencompassed isles we cherish yet
in this dark ruinsuch were mine even there
as in its sleep some odorous violet
while yet its leaves with nightly dews are wet
breathes in prophetic dreams of days uprise
or as ere scythian frost in fear has met
springs messengers descending from the skies
the buds foreknow their lifethis hope must ever rise


so years had passed when sudden earthquake rent
the depth of ocean and the cavern cracked
with sound as if the worlds wide continent
had fallen in universal ruin wracked
and through the cleft streamed in one cataract
the stifling waterswhen i woke the flood
whose banded waves that crystal cave had sacked
was ebbing round me and my bright abode
before me yawneda chasm desert and bare and broad


above me was the sky beneath the sea
i stood upon a point of shattered stone
and heard loose rocks rushing tumultuously
with splash and shock into the deepanon
all ceased and there was silence wide and lone
i felt that i was free the oceanspray
quivered beneath my feet the broad heaven shone
around and in my hair the winds did play
lingering as they pursued their unimpeded way


my spirit moved upon the sea like wind
which round some thymy cape will lag and hover
though it can wake the still cloud and unbind
the strength of tempest day was almost over
when through the fading light i could discover
a ship approachingits white sails were fed
with the north windits moving shade did cover
the twilight deep the mariners in dread
cast anchor when they saw new rocks around them spread


and when they saw one sitting on a crag
they sent a boat to methe sailors rowed
in awe through many a new and fearful jag
of overhanging rock through which there flowed
the foam of streams that cannot make abode
they came and questioned me but when they heard
my voice they became silent and they stood
and moved as men in whom new love had stirred
deep thoughts so to the ship we passed without a word


i sate beside the steersman then and gazing
upon the west cried spread the sails behold
the sinking moon is like a watchtower blazing
over the mountains yetthe city of gold
yon cape alone does from the sight withhold
the stream is fleetthe north breathes steadily
beneath the stars they tremble with the cold
ye cannot rest upon the dreary sea
haste haste to the warm home of happier destiny


the mariners obeyedthe captain stood
aloof and whispering to the pilot said
alas alas i fear we are pursued
by wicked ghosts a phantom of the dead
the night before we sailed came to my bed
in dream like that the pilot then replied
it cannot beshe is a human maid
her low voice makes you weepshe is some bride
or daughter of high birthshe can be nought beside


we passed the islets borne by wind and stream
and as we sailed the mariners came near
and thronged around to listenin the gleam
of the pale moon i stood as one whom fear
may not attaint and my calm voice did rear
ye are all humanyon broad moon gives light
to millions who the selfsame likeness wear
even while i speakbeneath this very night
their thoughts flow on like ours in sadness or delight


what dream ye your own hands have built an home
even for yourselves on a beloved shore
for some fond eyes are pining till they come
how they will greet him when his toils are oer
and laughing babes rush from the wellknown door
is this your care ye toil for your own good
ye feel and thinkhas some immortal power
such purposes or in a human mood
dream ye some power thus builds for man in solitude


what is that power ye mock yourselves and give
a human heart to what ye cannot know
as if the cause of life could think and live
twere as if mans own works should feel and show
the hopes and fears and thoughts from which they flow
and he be like to them lo plague is free
to waste blight poison earthquake hail and snow
disease and want and worse necessity
of hate and ill and pride and fear and tyranny


what is that power some moonstruck sophist stood
watching the shade from his own soul upthrown
fill heaven and darken earth and in such mood
the form he saw and worshipped was his own
his likeness in the worlds vast mirror shown
and twere an innocent dream but that a faith
nursed by fears dew of poison grows thereon
and that men say that power has chosen death
on all who scorn its laws to wreak immortal wrath


men say that they themselves have heard and seen
or known from others who have known such things
a shade a form which earth and heaven between
wields an invisible rodthat priests and kings
custom domestic sway ay all that brings
mans freeborn soul beneath the oppressors heel
are his strong ministers and that the stings
of death will make the wise his vengeance feel
though truth and virtue arm their hearts with tenfold steel


and it is said this power will punish wrong
yes add despair to crime and pain to pain
and deepest hell and deathless snakes among
will bind the wretch on whom is fixed a stain
which like a plague a burden and a bane
clung to him while he lived for love and hate
virtue and vice they say are difference vain
the will of strength is rightthis human state
tyrants that they may rule with lies thus desolate


alas what strength opinion is more frail
than yon dim cloud now fading on the moon
even while we gaze though it awhile avail
to hide the orb of truthand every throne
of earth or heaven though shadow rests thereon
one shape of many namesfor this ye plough
the barren waves of ocean hence each one
is slave or tyrant all betray and bow
command or kill or fear or wreak or suffer woe


its names are each a sign which maketh holy
all poweray the ghost the dream the shade
of powerlust falsehood hate and pride and folly
the pattern whence all fraud and wrong is made
a law to which mankind has been betrayed
and human love is as the name well known
of a dear mother whom the murderer laid
in bloody grave and into darkness thrown
gathered her wildered babes around him as his own


o love who to the hearts of wandering men
art as the calm to oceans weary waves
justice or truth or joy those only can
from slavery and religions labyrinth caves
guide us as one clear star the seaman saves
to give to all an equal share of good
to track the steps of freedom though through graves
she pass to suffer all in patient mood
to weep for crime though stained with thy friends dearest blood


to feel the peace of selfcontentments lot
to own all sympathies and outrage none
and in the inmost bowers of sense and thought
until lifes sunny day is quite gone down
to sit and smile with joy or not alone
to kiss salt tears from the worn cheek of woe
to live as if to love and live were one
this is not faith or law nor those who bow
to thrones on heaven or earth such destiny may know


but children near their parents tremble now
because they must obeyone rules another
and as one power rules both high and low
so man is made the captive of his brother
and hate is throned on high with fear her mother
above the highestand those fountaincells
whence love yet flowed when faith had choked all other
are darkenedwoman as the bondslave dwells
of man a slave and life is poisoned in its wells


man seeks for gold in mines that he may weave
a lasting chain for his own slavery
in fear and restless care that he may live
he toils for others who must ever be
the joyless thralls of like captivity
he murders for his chiefs delight in ruin
he builds the altar that its idols fee
may be his very blood he is pursuing
o blind and willing wretchhis own obscure undoing


womanshe is his slave she has become
a thing i weep to speakthe child of scorn
the outcast of a desolated home
falsehood and fear and toil like waves have worn
channels upon her cheek which smiles adorn
as calm decks the false oceanwell ye know
what woman is for none of woman born
can choose but drain the bitter dregs of woe
which ever from the oppressed to the oppressors flow


this need not be ye might arise and will
that gold should lose its power and thrones their glory
that love which none may bind be free to fill
the world like light and evil faith grown hoary
with crime be quenched and dieyon promontory
even now eclipses the descending moon
dungeons and palaces are transitory
high temples fade like vapourman alone
remains whose will has power when all beside is gone


let all be free and equalfrom your hearts
i feel an echo through my inmost frame
like sweetest sound seeking its mate it darts
whence come ye friends alas i cannot name
all that i read of sorrow toil and shame
on your worn faces as in legends old
which make immortal the disastrous fame
of conquerors and impostors false and bold
the discord of your hearts i in your looks behold


whence come ye friends from pouring human blood
forth on the earth or bring ye steel and gold
that kings may dupe and slay the multitude
or from the famished poor pale weak and cold
bear ye the earnings of their toil unfold
speak are your hands in slaughters sanguine hue
stained freshly have your hearts in guile grown old
know yourselves thus ye shall be pure as dew
and i will be a friend and sister unto you


disguise it notwe have one human heart
all mortal thoughts confess a common home
blush not for what may to thyself impart
stains of inevitable crime the doom
is this which has or may or must become
thine and all humankinds ye are the spoil
which time thus marks for the devouring tomb
thou and thy thoughts and they and all the toil
wherewith ye twine the rings of lifes perpetual coil


disguise it notye blush for what ye hate
and enmity is sister unto shame
look on your mindit is the book of fate
ah it is dark with many a blazoned name
of miseryall are mirrors of the same
but the dark fiend who with his iron pen
dipped in scorns fiery poison makes his fame
enduring there would oer the heads of men
pass harmless if they scorned to make their hearts his den


yes it is hate that shapeless fiendly thing
of many names all evil some divine
whom selfcontempt arms with a mortal sting
which when the heart its snaky folds entwine
is wasted quite and when it doth repine
to gorge such bitter prey on all beside
it turns with ninefold rage as with its twine
when amphisbaena some fair bird has tied
soon oer the putrid mass he threats on every side


reproach not thine own soul but know thyself
nor hate anothers crime nor loathe thine own
it is the dark idolatry of self
which when our thoughts and actions once are gone
demands that man should weep and bleed and groan
oh vacant expiation be at rest
the past is deaths the future is thine own
and love and joy can make the foulest breast
a paradise of flowers where peace might build her nest


speak thou whence come yea youth made reply
wearily wearily oer the boundless deep
we sailthou readest well the misery
told in these faded eyes but much doth sleep
within which there the poor heart loves to keep
or dare not write on the dishonoured brow
even from our childhood have we learned to steep
the bread of slavery in the tears of woe
and never dreamed of hope or refuge until now


yesi must speakmy secret should have perished
even with the heart it wasted as a brand
fades in the dying flame whose life it cherished
but that no human bosom can withstand
thee wondrous lady and the mild command
of thy keen eyesyes we are wretched slaves
who from their wonted loves and native land
are reft and bear oer the dividing waves
the unregarded prey of calm and happy graves


we drag afar from pastoral vales the fairest
among the daughters of those mountains lone
we drag them there where all things best and rarest
are stained and trampledyears have come and gone
since like the ship which bears me i have known
no thoughtbut now the eyes of one dear maid
on mine with light of mutual love have shone
she is my lifei am but as the shade
of hera smoke sent up from ashes soon to fade


for she must perish in the tyrants hall
alas alashe ceased and by the sail
sate coweringbut his sobs were heard by all
and still before the ocean and the gale
the ship fled fast till the stars gan to fail
and round me gathered with mute countenance
the seamen gazed the pilot worn and pale
with toil the captain with gray locks whose glance
met mine in restless awethey stood as in a trance


recede not pause not now thou art grown old
but hope will make thee young for hope and youth
are children of one mother even lovebehold
the eternal stars gaze on usis the truth
within your soul care for your own or ruth
for others sufferings do ye thirst to bear
a heart which not the serpent customs tooth
may violatebe free and even here
swear to be firm till death they cried we swear we swear


the very darkness shook as with a blast
of subterranean thunder at the cry
the hollow shore its thousand echoes cast
into the night as if the sea and sky
and earth rejoiced with newborn liberty
for in that name they swore bolts were undrawn
and on the deck with unaccustomed eye
the captives gazing stood and every one
shrank as the inconstant torch upon her countenance shone


they were earths purest children young and fair
with eyes the shrines of unawakened thought
and brows as bright as spring or morning ere
dark time had there its evil legend wrought
in characters of cloud which wither not
the change was like a dream to them but soon
they knew the glory of their altered lot
in the bright wisdom of youths breathless noon
sweet talk and smiles and sighs all bosoms did attune


but one was mute her cheeks and lips most fair
changing their hue like lilies newly blown
beneath a bright acacias shadowy hair
waved by the wind amid the sunny noon
showed that her soul was quivering and full soon
that youth arose and breathlessly did look
on her and me as for some speechless boon
i smiled and both their hands in mine i took
and felt a soft delight from what their spirits shook


that night we anchored in a woody bay
and sleep no more around us dared to hover
than when all doubt and fear has passed away
it shades the couch of some unresting lover
whose heart is now at rest thus night passed over
in mutual joyaround a forest grew
of poplars and dark oaks whose shade did cover
the waning stars pranked in the waters blue
and trembled in the wind which from the morning flew


the joyous mariners and each free maiden
now brought from the deep forest many a bough
with woodland spoil most innocently laden
soon wreaths of budding foliage seemed to flow
over the mast and sails the stern and prow
were canopied with blooming boughsthe while
on the slant suns path oer the waves we go
rejoicing like the dwellers of an isle
doomed to pursue those waves that cannot cease to smile


the many ships spotting the dark blue deep
with snowy sails fled fast as ours came nigh
in fear and wonder and on every steep
thousands did gaze they heard the startling cry
like earths own voice lifted unconquerably
to all her children the unbounded mirth
the glorious joy of thy nameliberty
they heardas oer the mountains of the earth
from peak to peak leap on the beams of mornings birth


so from that cry over the boundless hills
sudden was caught one universal sound
like a volcanos voice whose thunder fills
remotest skiessuch glorious madness found
a path through human hearts with stream which drowned
its struggling fears and cares dark customs brood
they knew not whence it came but felt around
a wide contagion pouredthey called aloud
on libertythat name lived on the sunny flood


we reached the portalas from many spirits
the wisdom which had waked that cry was fled
like the brief glory which dark heaven inherits
from the false dawn which fades ere it is spread
upon the nights devouring darkness shed
yet soon bright day will bursteven like a chasm
of fire to burn the shrouds outworn and dead
which wrap the world a wide enthusiasm
to cleanse the fevered world as with an earthquakes spasm


i walked through the great city then but free
from shame or fear those toilworn mariners
and happy maidens did encompass me
and like a subterranean wind that stirs
some forest among caves the hopes and fears
from every human soul a murmur strange
made as i passed and many wept with tears
of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range
and halfextinguished words which prophesied of change


for with strong speech i tore the veil that hid
nature and truth and liberty and love
as one who from some mountains pyramid
points to the unrisen sunthe shades approve
his truth and flee from every stream and grove
thus gentle thoughts did many a bosom fill
wisdom the mail of tried affections wove
for many a heart and tameless scorn of ill
thrice steeped in molten steel the unconquerable will


some said i was a maniac wild and lost
some that i scarce had risen from the grave
the prophets virgin bride a heavenly ghost
some said i was a fiend from my weird cave
who had stolen human shape and oer the wave
the forest and the mountain camesome said
i was the child of god sent down to save
woman from bonds and death and on my head
the burden of their sins would frightfully be laid


but soon my human words found sympathy
in human hearts the purest and the best
as friend with friend made common cause with me
and they were few but resolutethe rest
ere yet success the enterprise had blessed
leagued with me in their heartstheir meals their slumber
their hourly occupations were possessed
by hopes which i had armed to overnumber
those hosts of meaner cares which lifes strong wings encumber


but chiefly women whom my voice did waken
from their cold careless willing slavery
sought me one truth their dreary prison has shaken
they looked around and lo they became free
their many tyrants sitting desolately
in slavedeserted halls could none restrain
for wraths red fire had withered in the eye
whose lightning once was deathnor fear nor gain
could tempt one captive now to lock anothers chain


those who were sent to bind me wept and felt
their minds outsoar the bonds which clasped them round
even as a waxen shape may waste and melt
in the white furnace and a visioned swound
a pause of hope and awe the city bound
which like the silence of a tempests birth
when in its awful shadow it has wound
the sun the wind the ocean and the earth
hung terrible ere yet the lightnings have leaped forth


like clouds inwoven in the silent sky
by winds from distant regions meeting there
in the high name of truth and liberty
around the city millions gathered were
by hopes which sprang from many a hidden lair
words which the lore of truth in hues of flame
arrayed thine own wild songs which in the air
like homeless odours floated and the name
of thee and many a tongue which thou hadst dipped in flame


the tyrant knew his power was gone but fear
the nurse of vengeance bade him wait the event
that perfidy and custom gold and prayer
and whatsoeer when force is impotent
to fraud the sceptre of the world has lent
might as he judged confirm his failing sway
therefore throughout the streets the priests he sent
to curse the rebelsto their gods did they
for earthquake plague and want kneel in the public way


and grave and hoary men were bribed to tell
from seats where law is made the slave of wrong
how glorious athens in her splendour fell
because her sons were freeand that among
mankind the many to the few belong
by heaven and nature and necessity
they said that age was truth and that the young
marred with wild hopes the peace of slavery
with which old times and men had quelled the vain and free


and with the falsehood of their poisonous lips
they breathed on the enduring memory
of sages and of bards a brief eclipse
there was one teacher who necessity
had armed with strength and wrong against mankind
his slave and his avenger aye to be
that we were weak and sinful frail and blind
and that the will of one was peace and we
should seek for nought on earth but toil and misery


for thus we might avoid the hell hereafter
so spake the hypocrites who cursed and lied
alas their sway was past and tears and laughter
clung to their hoary hair withering the pride
which in their hollow hearts dared still abide
and yet obscener slaves with smoother brow
and sneers on their strait lips thin blue and wide
said that the rule of men was over now
and hence the subject world to womans will must bow


and gold was scattered through the streets and wine
flowed at a hundred feasts within the wall
in vain the steady towers in heaven did shine
as they were wont nor at the priestly call
left plague her banquet in the ethiops hall
nor famine from the rich mans portal came
where at her ease she ever preys on all
who throng to kneel for food nor fear nor shame
nor faith nor discord dimmed hopes newly kindled flame


for gold was as a god whose faith began
to fade so that its worshippers were few
and faith itself which in the heart of man
gives shape voice name to spectral terror knew
its downfall as the altars lonelier grew
till the priests stood alone within the fane
the shafts of falsehood unpolluting flew
and the cold sneers of calumny were vain
the union of the free with discords brand to stain


the rest thou knowestlo we two are here
we have survived a ruin wide and deep
strange thoughts are minei cannot grieve or fear
sitting with thee upon this lonely steep
i smile though human love should make me weep
we have survived a joy that knows no sorrow
and i do feel a mighty calmness creep
over my heart which can no longer borrow
its hues from chance or change dark children of tomorrow


we know not what will comeyet laon dearest
cythna shall be the prophetess of love
her lips shall rob thee of the grace thou wearest
to hide thy heart and clothe the shapes which rove
within the homeless futures wintry grove
for i now sitting thus beside thee seem
even with thy breath and blood to live and move
and violence and wrong are as a dream
which rolls from steadfast truth an unreturning stream


the blasts of autumn drive the winged seeds
over the earthnext come the snows and rain
and frosts and storms which dreary winter leads
out of his scythian cave a savage train
behold spring sweeps over the world again
shedding soft dews from her ethereal wings
flowers on the mountains fruits over the plain
and music on the waves and woods she flings
and love on all that lives and calm on lifeless things


o spring of hope and love and youth and gladness
windwinged emblem brightest best and fairest
whence comest thou when with dark winters sadness
the tears that fade in sunny smiles thou sharest
sister of joy thou art the child who wearest
thy mothers dying smile tender and sweet
thy mother autumn for whose grave thou bearest
fresh flowers and beams like flowers with gentle feet
disturbing not the leaves which are her windingsheet


virtue and hope and love like light and heaven
surround the worldwe are their chosen slaves
has not the whirlwind of our spirit driven
truths deathless germs to thoughts remotest caves
lo winter comesthe grief of many graves
the frost of death the tempest of the sword
the flood of tyranny whose sanguine waves
stagnate like ice at faith the enchanters word
and bind all human hearts in its repose abhorred


the seeds are sleeping in the soil meanwhile
the tyrant peoples dungeons with his prey
pale victims on the guarded scaffold smile
because they cannot speak and day by day
the moon of wasting science wanes away
among her stars and in that darkness vast
the sons of earth to their foul idols pray
and gray priests triumph and like blight or blast
a shade of selfish care oer human looks is cast


this is the winter of the worldand here
we die even as the winds of autumn fade
expiring in the frore and foggy air
behold spring comes though we must pass who made
the promise of its birtheven as the shade
which from our death as from a mountain flings
the future a broad sunrise thus arrayed
as with the plumes of overshadowing wings
from its dark gulf of chains earth like an eagle springs


o dearest love we shall be dead and cold
before this morn may on the world arise
wouldst thou the glory of its dawn behold
alas gaze not on me but turn thine eyes
on thine own heartit is a paradise
which everlasting spring has made its own
and while drear winter fills the naked skies
sweet streams of sunny thought and flowers freshblown
are there and weave their sounds and odours into one


in their own hearts the earnest of the hope
which made them great the good will ever find
and though some envious shade may interlope
between the effect and it one comes behind
who aye the future to the past will bind
necessity whose sightless strength for ever
evil with evil good with good must wind
in bands of union which no power may sever
they must bring forth their kind and be divided never


the good and mighty of departed ages
are in their graves the innocent and free
heroes and poets and prevailing sages
who leave the vesture of their majesty
to adorn and clothe this naked worldand we
are like to themsuch perish but they leave
all hope or love or truth or liberty
whose forms their mighty spirits could conceive
to be a rule and law to ages that survive


so be the turf heaped over our remains
even in our happy youth and that strange lot
whateer it be when in these mingling veins
the blood is still be ours let sense and thought
pass from our being or be numbered not
among the things that are let those who come
behind for whom our steadfast will has bought
a calm inheritance a glorious doom
insult with careless tread our undivided tomb


our many thoughts and deeds our life and love
our happiness and all that we have been
immortally must live and burn and move
when we shall be no morethe world has seen
a type of peace andas some most serene
and lovely spot to a poor maniacs eye
after long years some sweet and moving scene
of youthful hope returning suddenly
quells his long madnessthus man shall remember thee


and calumny meanwhile shall feed on us
as worms devour the dead and near the throne
and at the altar most accepted thus
shall sneers and curses bewhat we have done
none shall dare vouch though it be truly known
that record shall remain when they must pass
who built their pride on its oblivion
and fame in human hope which sculptured was
survive the perished scrolls of unenduring brass


the while we two beloved must depart
and sense and reason those enchanters fair
whose wand of power is hope would bid the heart
that gazed beyond the wormy grave despair
these eyes these lips this blood seems darkly there
to fade in hideous ruin no calm sleep
peopling with golden dreams the stagnant air
seems our obscure and rotting eyes to steep
in joybut senseless deatha ruin dark and deep


these are blind fanciesreason cannot know
what sense can neither feel nor thought conceive
there is delusion in the worldand woe
and fear and painwe know not whence we live
or why or how or what mute power may give
their being to each plant and star and beast
or even these thoughtscome near me i do weave
a chain i cannot breaki am possessed
with thoughts too swift and strong for one lone human breast


yes yesthy kiss is sweet thy lips are warm
o willingly beloved would these eyes
might they no more drink being from thy form
even as to sleep whence we again arise
close their faint orbs in death i fear nor prize
aught that can now betide unshared by thee
yes love when wisdom fails makes cythna wise
darkness and death if death be true must be
dearer than life and hope if unenjoyed with thee


alas our thoughts flow on with stream whose waters
return not to their fountainearth and heaven
the ocean and the sun the clouds their daughters
winter and spring and morn and noon and even
all that we are or know is darkly driven
towards one gulflo what a change is come
since i first spakebut time shall be forgiven
though it change all but theeshe ceasednights gloom
meanwhile had fallen on earth from the skys sunless dome


though she had ceased her countenance uplifted
to heaven still spake with solemn glory bright
her dark deep eyes her lips whose motions gifted
the air they breathed with love her locks undight
fair star of life and love i cried my souls delight
why lookest thou on the crystalline skies
o that my spirit were yon heaven of night
which gazes on thee with its thousand eyes
she turned to me and smiledthat smile was paradise


was there a human spirit in the steed
that thus with his proud voice ere night was gone
he broke our linked rest or do indeed
all living things a common nature own
and thought erect an universal throne
where many shapes one tribute ever bear
and earth their mutual mother does she groan
to see her sons contend and makes she bare
her breast that all in peace its drainless stores may share


i have heard friendly sounds from many a tongue
which was not humanthe lone nightingale
has answered me with her most soothing song
out of her ivy bower when i sate pale
with grief and sighed beneath from many a dale
the antelopes who flocked for food have spoken
with happy sounds and motions that avail
like mans own speech and such was now the token
of waning night whose calm by that proud neigh was broken


each night that mighty steed bore me abroad
and i returned with food to our retreat
and dark intelligence the blood which flowed
over the fields had stained the coursers feet
soon the dust drinks that bitter dewthen meet
the vulture and the wild dog and the snake
the wolf and the hyaena gray and eat
the dead in horrid truce their throngs did make
behind the steed a chasm like waves in a ships wake


for from the utmost realms of earth came pouring
the banded slaves whom every despot sent
at that throned traitors summons like the roaring
of fire whose floods the wild deer circumvent
in the scorched pastures of the south so bent
the armies of the leagued kings around
their files of steel and flamethe continent
trembled as with a zone of ruin bound
beneath their feet the sea shook with their navies sound


from every nation of the earth they came
the multitude of moving heartless things
whom slaves call men obediently they came
like sheep whom from the fold the shepherd brings
to the stall red with blood their many kings
led them thus erring from their native land
tartar and frank and millions whom the wings
of indian breezes lull and many a band
the arctic anarch sent and idumeas sand


fertile in prodigies and liesso there
strange natures made a brotherhood of ill
the desert savage ceased to grasp in fear
his asian shield and bow when at the will
of europes subtler son the bolt would kill
some shepherd sitting on a rock secure
but smiles of wondering joy his face would fill
and savage sympathy those slaves impure
each one the other thus from ill to ill did lure


for traitorously did that foul tyrant robe
his countenance in lieseven at the hour
when he was snatched from death then oer the globe
with secret signs from many a mountaintower
with smoke by day and fire by night the power
of kings and priests those dark conspirators
he calledthey knew his cause their own and swore
like wolves and serpents to their mutual wars
strange truce with many a rite which earth and heaven abhors


myriads had comemillions were on their way
the tyrant passed surrounded by the steel
of hired assassins through the public way
choked with his countrys deadhis footsteps reel
on the fresh bloodhe smiles ay now i feel
i am a king in truth he said and took
his royal seat and bade the torturing wheel
be brought and fire and pincers and the hook
and scorpions that his soul on its revenge might look


but first go slay the rebelswhy return
the victor bands he said millions yet live
of whom the weakest with one word might turn
the scales of victory yetlet none survive
but those within the wallseach fifth shall give
the expiation for his brethren here
go forth and waste and killo king forgive
my speech a soldier answeredbut we fear
the spirits of the night and morn is drawing near


for we were slaying still without remorse
and now that dreadful chief beneath my hand
defenceless lay when on a hellblack horse
an angel bright as day waving a brand
which flashed among the stars passeddost thou stand
parleying with me thou wretch the king replied
slaves bind him to the wheel and of this band
whoso will drag that woman to his side
that scared him thus may burn his dearest foe beside


and gold and glory shall be hisgo forth
they rushed into the plainloud was the roar
of their career the horsemen shook the earth
the wheeled artillerys speed the pavement tore
the infantry file after file did pour
their clouds on the utmost hills five days they slew
among the wasted fields the sixth saw gore
stream through the city on the seventh the dew
of slaughter became stiff and there was peace anew


peace in the desert fields and villages
between the glutted beasts and mangled dead
peace in the silent streets save when the cries
of victims to their fiery judgement led
made pale their voiceless lips who seemed to dread
even in their dearest kindred lest some tongue
be faithless to the fear yet unbetrayed
peace in the tyrants palace where the throng
waste the triumphal hours in festival and song


day after day the burning sun rolled on
over the deathpolluted landit came
out of the east like fire and fiercely shone
a lamp of autumn ripening with its flame
the few lone ears of cornthe sky became
stagnate with heat so that each cloud and blast
languished and diedthe thirsting air did claim
all moisture and a rotting vapour passed
from the unburied dead invisible and fast


first want then plague came on the beasts their food
failed and they drew the breath of its decay
millions on millions whom the scent of blood
had lured or who from regions far away
had tracked the hosts in festival array
from their dark deserts gaunt and wasting now
stalked like fell shades among their perished prey
in their green eyes a strange disease did glow
they sank in hideous spasm or pains severe and slow


the fish were poisoned in the streams the birds
in the green woods perished the insect race
was withered up the scattered flocks and herds
who had survived the wild beasts hungry chase
died moaning each upon the others face
in helpless agony gazing round the city
all night the lean hyaenas their sad case
like starving infants wailed a woeful ditty
and many a mother wept pierced with unnatural pity


amid the aereal minarets on high
the ethiopian vultures fluttering fell
from their long line of brethren in the sky
startling the concourse of mankindtoo well
these signs the coming mischief did foretell
strange panic first a deep and sickening dread
within each heart like ice did sink and dwell
a voiceless thought of evil which did spread
with the quick glance of eyes like withering lightnings shed


day after day when the year wanes the frosts
strip its green crown of leaves till all is bare
so on those strange and congregated hosts
came famine a swift shadow and the air
groaned with the burden of a new despair
famine than whom misrule no deadlier daughter
feeds from her thousand breasts though sleeping there
with lidless eyes lie faith and plague and slaughter
a ghastly brood conceived of lethes sullen water


there was no food the corn was trampled down
the flocks and herds had perished on the shore
the dead and putrid fish were ever thrown
the deeps were foodless and the winds no more
creaked with the weight of birds but as before
those winged things sprang forth were void of shade
the vines and orchards autumns golden store
were burnedso that the meanest food was weighed
with gold and avarice died before the god it made


there was no cornin the wide marketplace
all loathliest things even human flesh was sold
they weighed it in small scalesand many a face
was fixed in eager horror then his gold
the miser brought the tender maid grown bold
through hunger bared her scorned charms in vain
the mother brought her eldest born controlled
by instinct blind as love but turned again
and bade her infant suck and died in silent pain


then fell blue plague upon the race of man
o for the sheathed steel so late which gave
oblivion to the dead when the streets ran
with brothers blood o that the earthquakes grave
would gape or ocean lift its stifling wave
vain criesthroughout the streets thousands pursued
each by his fiery torture howl and rave
or sit in frenzys unimagined mood
upon fresh heaps of dead a ghastly multitude


it was not hunger now but thirst each well
was choked with rotting corpses and became
a cauldron of green mist made visible
at sunrise thither still the myriads came
seeking to quench the agony of the flame
which raged like poison through their bursting veins
naked they were from torture without shame
spotted with nameless scars and lurid blains
childhood and youth and age writhing in savage pains


it was not thirst but madness many saw
their own lean image everywhere it went
a ghastlier self beside them till the awe
of that dread sight to selfdestruction sent
those shrieking victims some ere life was spent
sought with a horrid sympathy to shed
contagion on the sound and others rent
their matted hair and cried aloud we tread
on fire the avenging power his hell on earth has spread


sometimes the living by the dead were hid
near the great fountain in the public square
where corpses made a crumbling pyramid
under the sun was heard one stifled prayer
for life in the hot silence of the air
and strange twas amid that hideous heap to see
some shrouded in their long and golden hair
as if not dead but slumbering quietly
like forms which sculptors carve then love to agony


famine had spared the palace of the king
he rioted in festival the while
he and his guards and priests but plague did fling
one shadow upon all famine can smile
on him who brings it food and pass with guile
of thankful falsehood like a courtier gray
the housedog of the throne but many a mile
comes plague a winged wolf who loathes alway
the garbage and the scum that strangers make her prey


so near the throne amid the gorgeous feast
sheathed in resplendent arms or loosely dight
to luxury ere the mockery yet had ceased
that lingered on his lips the warriors might
was loosened and a new and ghastlier night
in dreams of frenzy lapped his eyes he fell
headlong or with stiff eyeballs sate upright
among the guests or raving mad did tell
strange truths a dying seer of dark oppressions hell


the princes and the priests were pale with terror
that monstrous faith wherewith they ruled mankind
fell like a shaft loosed by the bowmans error
on their own hearts they sought and they could find
no refugetwas the blind who led the blind
so through the desolate streets to the high fane
the manytongued and endless armies wind
in sad procession each among the train
to his own idol lifts his supplications vain


o god they cried we know our secret pride
has scorned thee and thy worship and thy name
secure in human power we have defied
thy fearful might we bend in fear and shame
before thy presence with the dust we claim
kindred be merciful o king of heaven
most justly have we suffered for thy fame
made dim but be at length our sins forgiven
ere to despair and death thy worshippers be driven


o king of glory thou alone hast power
who can resist thy will who can restrain
thy wrath when on the guilty thou dost shower
the shafts of thy revenge a blistering rain
greatest and best be merciful again
have we not stabbed thine enemies and made
the earth an altar and the heavens a fane
where thou wert worshipped with their blood and laid
those hearts in dust which would thy searchless works have weighed


well didst thou loosen on this impious city
thine angels of revenge recall them now
thy worshippers abased here kneel for pity
and bind their souls by an immortal vow
we swear by thee and to our oath do thou
give sanction from thine hell of fiends and flame
that we will kill with fire and torments slow
the last of those who mocked thy holy name
and scorned the sacred laws thy prophets did proclaim


thus they with trembling limbs and pallid lips
worshipped their own hearts image dim and vast
scared by the shade wherewith they would eclipse
the light of other mindstroubled they passed
from the great templefiercely still and fast
the arrows of the plague among them fell
and they on one another gazed aghast
and through the hosts contention wild befell
as each of his own god the wondrous works did tell


and oromaze joshua and mahomet
moses and buddh zerdusht and brahm and foh
a tumult of strange names which never met
before as watchwords of a single woe
arose each raging votary gan to throw
aloft his armed hands and each did howl
our god alone is godand slaughter now
would have gone forth when from beneath a cowl
a voice came forth which pierced like ice through every soul


twas an iberian priest from whom it came
a zealous man who led the legioned west
with words which faith and pride had steeped in flame
to quell the unbelievers a dire guest
even to his friends was he for in his breast
did hate and guile lie watchful intertwined
twin serpents in one deep and winding nest
he loathed all faith beside his own and pined
to wreak his fear of heaven in vengeance on mankind


but more he loathed and hated the clear light
of wisdom and free thought and more did fear
lest kindled once its beams might pierce the night
even where his idol stood for far and near
did many a heart in europe leap to hear
that faith and tyranny were trampled down
many a pale victim doomed for truth to share
the murderers cell or see with helpless groan
the priests his children drag for slaves to serve their own


he dared not kill the infidels with fire
or steel in europe the slow agonies
of legal torture mocked his keen desire
so he made truce with those who did despise
the expiation and the sacrifice
that though detested islams kindred creed
might crush for him those deadlier enemies
for fear of god did in his bosom breed
a jealous hate of man an unreposing need


peace peace he cried when we are dead the day
of judgement comes and all shall surely know
whose god is god each fearfully shall pay
the errors of his faith in endless woe
but there is sent a mortal vengeance now
on earth because an impious race had spurned
him whom we all adorea subtle foe
by whom for ye this dread reward was earned
and kingly thrones which rest on faith nigh overturned


think ye because ye weep and kneel and pray
that god will lull the pestilence it rose
even from beneath his throne where many a day
his mercy soothed it to a dark repose
it walks upon the earth to judge his foes
and what are thou and i that he should deign
to curb his ghastly minister or close
the gates of death ere they receive the twain
who shook with mortal spells his undefended reign


ay there is famine in the gulf of hell
its giant worms of fire for ever yawn
their lurid eyes are on us those who fell
by the swift shafts of pestilence ere dawn
are in their jaws they hunger for the spawn
of satan their own brethren who were sent
to make our souls their spoil see see they fawn
like dogs and they will sleep with luxury spent
when those detested hearts their iron fangs have rent


our god may then lull pestilence to sleep
pile high the pyre of expiation now
a forests spoil of boughs and on the heap
pour venomous gums which sullenly and slow
when touched by flame shall burn and melt and flow
a stream of clinging fireand fix on high
a net of iron and spread forth below
a couch of snakes and scorpions and the fry
of centipedes and worms earths hellish progeny


let laon and laone on that pyre
linked tight with burning brass perishthen pray
that with this sacrifice the withering ire
of heaven may be appeased he ceased and they
a space stood silent as far far away
the echoes of his voice among them died
and he knelt down upon the dust alway
muttering the curses of his speechless pride
whilst shame and fear and awe the armies did divide


his voice was like a blast that burst the portal
of fabled hell and as he spake each one
saw gape beneath the chasms of fire immortal
and heaven above seemed cloven where on a throne
girt round with storms and shadows sate alone
their king and judgefear killed in every breast
all natural pity then a fear unknown
before and with an inward fire possessed
they raged like homeless beasts whom burning woods invest


twas mornat noon the public crier went forth
proclaiming through the living and the dead
the monarch saith that his great empires worth
is set on laon and laones head
he who but one yet living here can lead
or who the life from both their hearts can wring
shall be the kingdoms heira glorious meed
but he who both alive can hither bring
the princess shall espouse and reign an equal king


ere night the pyre was piled the net of iron
was spread above the fearful couch below
it overtopped the towers that did environ
that spacious square for fear is never slow
to build the thrones of hate her mate and foe
so she scourged forth the maniac multitude
to rear this pyramidtottering and slow
plaguestricken foodless like lean herds pursued
by gadflies they have piled the heath and gums and wood


night came a starless and a moonless gloom
until the dawn those hosts of many a nation
stood round that pile as near one lovers tomb
two gentle sisters mourn their desolation
and in the silence of that expectation
was heard on high the reptiles hiss and crawl
it was so deepsave when the devastation
of the swift pest with fearful interval
marking its path with shrieks among the crowd would fall


morn cameamong those sleepless multitudes
madness and fear and plague and famine still
heaped corpse on corpse as in autumnal woods
the frosts of many a wind with dead leaves fill
earths cold and sullen brooks in silence still
the pale survivors stood ere noon the fear
of hell became a panic which did kill
like hunger or disease with whispers drear
as hush hark come they yetjust heaven thine hour is near


and priests rushed through their ranks some counterfeiting
the rage they did inspire some mad indeed
with their own lies they said their god was waiting
to see his enemies writhe and burn and bleed
and that till then the snakes of hell had need
of human soulsthree hundred furnaces
soon blazed through the wide city where with speed
men brought their infidel kindred to appease
gods wrath and while they burned knelt round on quivering knees


the noontide sun was darkened with that smoke
the winds of eve dispersed those ashes gray
the madness which these rites had lulled awoke
again at sunsetwho shall dare to say
the deeds which night and fear brought forth or weigh
in balance just the good and evil there
he might mans deep and searchless heart display
and cast a light on those dim labyrinths where
hope near imagined chasms is struggling with despair


tis said a mother dragged three children then
to those fierce flames which roast the eyes in the head
and laughed and died and that unholy men
feasting like fiends upon the infidel dead
looked from their meal and saw an angel tread
the visible floor of heaven and it was she
and on that night one without doubt or dread
came to the fire and said stop i am he
kill methey burned them both with hellish mockery


and one by one that night young maidens came
beauteous and calm like shapes of living stone
clothed in the light of dreams and by the flame
which shrank as overgorged they laid them down
and sung a low sweet song of which alone
one word was heard and that was liberty
and that some kissed their marble feet with moan
like love and died and then that they did die
with happy smiles which sunk in white tranquillity


she saw me notshe heard me notalone
upon the mountains dizzy brink she stood
she spake not breathed not moved notthere was thrown
over her look the shadow of a mood
which only clothes the heart in solitude
a thought of voiceless depthshe stood alone
above the heavens were spreadbelow the flood
was murmuring in its cavesthe wind had blown
her hair apart through which her eyes and forehead shone


a cloud was hanging oer the western mountains
before its blue and moveless depth were flying
gray mists poured forth from the unresting fountains
of darkness in the norththe day was dying
sudden the sun shone forth its beams were lying
like boiling gold on ocean strange to see
and on the shattered vapours which defying
the power of light in vain tossed restlessly
in the red heaven like wrecks in a tempestuous sea


it was a stream of living beams whose bank
on either side by the clouds cleft was made
and where its chasms that flood of glory drank
its waves gushed forth like fire and as if swayed
by some mute tempest rolled on her the shade
of her bright image floated on the river
of liquid light which then did end and fade
her radiant shape upon its verge did shiver
aloft her flowing hair like strings of flame did quiver


i stood beside her but she saw me not
she looked upon the sea and skies and earth
rapture and love and admiration wrought
a passion deeper far than tears or mirth
or speech or gesture or whateer has birth
from common joy which with the speechless feeling
that led her there united and shot forth
from her far eyes a light of deep revealing
all but her dearest self from my regard concealing


her lips were parted and the measured breath
was now heard thereher dark and intricate eyes
orb within orb deeper than sleep or death
absorbed the glories of the burning skies
which mingling with her hearts deep ecstasies
burst from her looks and gesturesand a light
of liquid tenderness like love did rise
from her whole frame an atmosphere which quite
arrayed her in its beams tremulous and soft and bright


she would have clasped me to her glowing frame
those warm and odorous lips might soon have shed
on mine the fragrance and the invisible flame
which now the cold winds stoleshe would have laid
upon my languid heart her dearest head
i might have heard her voice tender and sweet
her eyes mingling with mine might soon have fed
my soul with their own joyone moment yet
i gazedwe parted then never again to meet


never but once to meet on earth again
she heard me as i fledher eager tone
sunk on my heart and almost wove a chain
around my will to link it with her own
so that my stern resolve was almost gone
i cannot reach thee whither dost thou fly
my steps are faintcome back thou dearest one
return ah me returnthe wind passed by
on which those accents died faint far and lingeringly


woe woe that moonless midnightwant and pest
were horrible but one more fell doth rear
as in a hydras swarming lair its crest
eminent among those victimseven the fear
of hell each girt by the hot atmosphere
of his blind agony like a scorpion stung
by his own rage upon his burning bier
of circling coals of fire but still there clung
one hope like a keen sword on starting threads uphung


not deathdeath was no more refuge or rest
not lifeit was despair to benot sleep
for fiends and chasms of fire had dispossessed
all natural dreams to wake was not to weep
but to gaze mad and pallid at the leap
to which the future like a snaky scourge
or like some tyrants eye which aye doth keep
its withering beam upon his slaves did urge
their steps they heard the roar of hells sulphureous surge


each of that multitude alone and lost
to sense of outward things one hope yet knew
as on a foamgirt crag some seaman tossed
stares at the rising tide or like the crew
whilst now the ship is splitting through and through
each if the tramp of a far steed was heard
started from sick despair or if there flew
one murmur on the wind or if some word
which none can gather yet the distant crowd has stirred


why became cheeks wan with the kiss of death
paler from hope they had sustained despair
why watched those myriads with suspended breath
sleepless a second night they are not here
the victims and hour by hour a vision drear
warm corpses fall upon the claycold dead
and even in death their lips are wreathed with fear
the crowd is mute and movelessoverhead
silent arcturus shinesha hearst thou not the tread


of rushing feet laughter the shout the scream
of triumph not to be contained see hark
they come they come give way alas ye deem
falselytis but a crowd of maniacs stark
driven like a troop of spectres through the dark
from the choked well whence a bright deathfire sprung
a lurid earthstar which dropped many a spark
from its blue train and spreading widely clung
to their wild hair like mist the topmost pines among


and many from the crowd collected there
joined that strange dance in fearful sympathies
there was the silence of a long despair
when the last echo of those terrible cries
came from a distant street like agonies
stifled afarbefore the tyrants throne
all night his aged senate sate their eyes
in stony expectation fixed when one
sudden before them stood a stranger and alone


dark priests and haughty warriors gazed on him
with baffled wonder for a hermits vest
concealed his face but when he spake his tone
ere yet the matter did their thoughts arrest
earnest benignant calm as from a breast
void of all hate or terrormade them start
for as with gentle accents he addressed
his speech to them on each unwilling heart
unusual awe did falla spiritquelling dart


ye princes of the earth ye sit aghast
amid the ruin which yourselves have made
yes desolation heard your trumpets blast
and sprang from sleepdark terror has obeyed
your biddingo that i whom ye have made
your foe could set my dearest enemy free
from pain and fear but evil casts a shade
which cannot pass so soon and hate must be
the nurse and parent still of an ill progeny


ye turn to heaven for aid in your distress
alas that ye the mighty and the wise
who if ye dared might not aspire to less
than ye conceive of power should fear the lies
which thou and thou didst frame for mysteries
to blind your slavesconsider your own thought
an empty and a cruel sacrifice
ye now prepare for a vain idol wrought
out of the fears and hate which vain desires have brought


ye seek for happinessalas the day
ye find it not in luxury nor in gold
nor in the fame nor in the envied sway
for which o willing slaves to custom old
severe taskmistress ye your hearts have sold
ye seek for peace and when ye die to dream
no evil dreams all mortal things are cold
and senseless then if aught survive i deem
it must be love and joy for they immortal seem


fear not the future weep not for the past
oh could i win your ears to dare be now
glorious and great and calm that ye would cast
into the dust those symbols of your woe
purple and gold and steel that ye would go
proclaiming to the nations whence ye came
that want and plague and fear from slavery flow
and that mankind is free and that the shame
of royalty and faith is lost in freedoms fame


if thus tis wellif not i come to say
that laon while the stranger spoke among
the council sudden tumult and affray
arose for many of those warriors young
had on his eloquent accents fed and hung
like bees on mountainflowers they knew the truth
and from their thrones in vindication sprung
the men of faith and law then without ruth
drew forth their secret steel and stabbed each ardent youth


they stabbed them in the back and sneereda slave
who stood behind the throne those corpses drew
each to its bloody dark and secret grave
and one more daring raised his steel anew
to pierce the stranger what hast thou to do
with me poor wretchcalm solemn and severe
that voice unstrung his sinews and he threw
his dagger on the ground and pale with fear
sate silentlyhis voice then did the stranger rear


it doth avail not that i weep for ye
ye cannot change since ye are old and gray
and ye have chosen your lotyour fame must be
a book of blood whence in a milder day
men shall learn truth when ye are wrapped in clay
now ye shall triumph i am laons friend
and him to your revenge will i betray
so ye concede one easy boon attend
for now i speak of things which ye can apprehend


there is a people mighty in its youth
a land beyond the oceans of the west
where though with rudest rites freedom and truth
are worshipped from a glorious mothers breast
who since high athens fell among the rest
sate like the queen of nations but in woe
by inbred monsters outraged and oppressed
turns to her chainless child for succour now
it draws the milk of power in wisdoms fullest flow


that land is like an eagle whose young gaze
feeds on the noontide beam whose golden plume
floats moveless on the storm and in the blaze
of sunrise gleams when earth is wrapped in gloom
an epitaph of glory for the tomb
of murdered europe may thy fame be made
great people as the sands shalt thou become
thy growth is swift as morn when night must fade
the multitudinous earth shall sleep beneath thy shade


yes in the desert there is built a home
for freedom genius is made strong to rear
the monuments of man beneath the dome
of a new heaven myriads assemble there
whom the proud lords of man in rage or fear
drive from their wasted homes the boon i pray
is thisthat cythna shall be convoyed there
nay start not at the nameamerica
and then to you this night laon will i betray


with me do what ye will i am your foe
the light of such a joy as makes the stare
of hungry snakes like living emeralds glow
shone in a hundred human eyeswhere where
is laon haste fly drag him swiftly here
we grant thy booni put no trust in ye
swear by the power ye dreadwe swear we swear
the stranger threw his vest back suddenly
and smiled in gentle pride and said lo i am he


the transport of a fierce and monstrous gladness
spread through the multitudinous streets fast flying
upon the winds of fear from his dull madness
the starveling waked and died in joy the dying
among the corpses in stark agony lying
just heard the happy tidings and in hope
closed their faint eyes from house to house replying
with loud acclaim the living shook heavens cope
and filled the startled earth with echoes morn did ope


its pale eyes then and lo the long array
of guards in golden arms and priests beside
singing their bloody hymns whose garbs betray
the blackness of the faith it seems to hide
and see the tyrants gemwrought chariot glide
among the gloomy cowls and glittering spears
a shape of light is sitting by his side
a child most beautiful i the midst appears
laonexempt alone from mortal hopes and fears


his head and feet are bare his hands are bound
behind with heavy chains yet none do wreak
their scoffs on him though myriads throng around
there are no sneers upon his lip which speak
that scorn or hate has made him bold his cheek
resolve has not turned palehis eyes are mild
and calm and like the morn about to break
smile on mankindhis heart seems reconciled
to all things and itself like a reposing child


tumult was in the soul of all beside
ill joy or doubt or fear but those who saw
their tranquil victim pass felt wonder glide
into their brain and became calm with awe
see the slow pageant near the pile doth draw
a thousand torches in the spacious square
borne by the ready slaves of ruthless law
await the signal round the morning fair
is changed to a dim night by that unnatural glare


and see beneath a sunbright canopy
upon a platform level with the pile
the anxious tyrant sit enthroned on high
girt by the chieftains of the host all smile
in expectation but one child the while
i laon led by mutes ascend my bier
of fire and look around each distant isle
is dark in the bright dawn towers far and near
pierce like reposing flames the tremulous atmosphere


there was such silence through the host as when
an earthquake trampling on some populous town
has crushed ten thousand with one tread and men
expect the second all were mute but one
that fairest child who bold with love alone
stood up before the king without avail
pleading for laons lifeher stifled groan
was heardshe trembled like one aspen pale
among the gloomy pines of a norwegian vale


what were his thoughts linked in the morning sun
among those reptiles stingless with delay
even like a tyrants wraththe signalgun
roaredhark again in that dread pause he lay
as in a quiet dreamthe slaves obey
a thousand torches dropand hark the last
bursts on that awful silence far away
millions with hearts that beat both loud and fast
watch for the springing flame expectant and aghast


they flythe torches falla cry of fear
has startled the triumphantthey recede
for ere the cannons roar has died they hear
the tramp of hoofs like earthquake and a steed
dark and gigantic with the tempests speed
bursts through their ranks a woman sits thereon
fairer it seems than aught that earth can breed
calm radiant like the phantom of the dawn
a spirit from the caves of daylight wandering gone


all thought it was gods angel come to sweep
the lingering guilty to their fiery grave
the tyrant from his throne in dread did leap
her innocence his child from fear did save
scared by the faith they feigned each priestly slave
knelt for his mercy whom they served with blood
and like the refluence of a mighty wave
sucked into the loud sea the multitude
with crushing panic fled in terrors altered mood


they pause they blush they gazea gathering shout
bursts like one sound from the ten thousand streams
of a tempestuous seathat sudden rout
one checked who never in his mildest dreams
felt awe from grace or loveliness the seams
of his rent heart so hard and cold a creed
had seared with blistering icebut he misdeems
that he is wise whose wounds do only bleed
inly for selfthus thought the iberian priest indeed


and others too thought he was wise to see
in pain and fear and hate something divine
in love and beauty no divinity
now with a bitter smile whose light did shine
like a fiends hope upon his lips and eyne
he said and the persuasion of that sneer
rallied his trembling comradesis it mine
to stand alone when kings and soldiers fear
a woman heaven has sent its other victim here


were it not impious said the king to break
our holy oathimpious to keep it say
shrieked the exulting priestslaves to the stake
bind her and on my head the burden lay
of her just tormentsat the judgement day
will i stand up before the golden throne
of heaven and cry to thee did i betray
an infidel but for me she would have known
another moments joy the glory be thine own


they trembled but replied not nor obeyed
pausing in breathless silence cythna sprung
from her gigantic steed who like a shade
chased by the winds those vacant streets among
fled tameless as the brazen rein she flung
upon his neck and kissed his mooned brow
a piteous sight that one so fair and young
the clasp of such a fearful death should woo
with smiles of tender joy as beamed from cythna now


the warm tears burst in spite of faith and fear
from many a tremulous eye but like soft dews
which feed springs earliest buds hung gathered there
frozen by doubtalas they could not choose
but weep for when her faint limbs did refuse
to climb the pyre upon the mutes she smiled
and with her eloquent gestures and the hues
of her quick lips even as a weary child
wins sleep from some fond nurse with its caresses mild


she won them though unwilling her to bind
near me among the snakes when there had fled
one soft reproach that was most thrilling kind
she smiled on me and nothing then we said
but each upon the others countenance fed
looks of insatiate love the mighty veil
which doth divide the living and the dead
was almost rent the world grew dim and pale
all light in heaven or earth beside our love did fail


yetyetone brief relapse like the last beam
of dying flames the stainless air around
hung silent and serenea bloodred gleam
burst upwards hurling fiercely from the ground
the globed smokei heard the mighty sound
of its uprise like a tempestuous ocean
and through its chasms i saw as in a swound
the tyrants child fall without life or motion
before his throne subdued by some unseen emotion


and is this deaththe pyre has disappeared
the pestilence the tyrant and the throng
the flames grow silentslowly there is heard
the music of a breathsuspending song
which like the kiss of love when life is young
steeps the faint eyes in darkness sweet and deep
with everchanging notes it floats along
till on my passive soul there seemed to creep
a melody like waves on wrinkled sands that leap


the warm touch of a soft and tremulous hand
wakened me then lo cythna sate reclined
beside me on the waved and golden sand
of a clear pool upon a bank oertwined
with strange and starbright flowers which to the wind
breathed divine odour high above was spread
the emerald heaven of trees of unknown kind
whose moonlike blooms and bright fruit overhead
a shadow which was light upon the waters shed


and round about sloped many a lawny mountain
with incensebearing forests and vast caves
of marble radiance to that mighty fountain
and where the flood its own bright margin laves
their echoes talk with its eternal waves
which from the depths whose jagged caverns breed
their unreposing strife it lifts and heaves
till through a chasm of hills they roll and feed
a river deep which flies with smooth but arrowy speed


as we sate gazing in a trance of wonder
a boat approached borne by the musical air
along the waves which sung and sparkled under
its rapid keela winged shape sate there
a child with silvershining wings so fair
that as her bark did through the waters glide
the shadow of the lingering waves did wear
light as from starry beams from side to side
while veering to the wind her plumes the bark did guide


the boat was one curved shell of hollow pearl
almost translucent with the light divine
of her within the prow and stern did curl
horned on high like the young moon supine
when oer dim twilight mountains dark with pine
it floats upon the sunsets sea of beams
whose golden waves in many a purple line
fade fast till borne on sunlights ebbing streams
dilating on earths verge the sunken meteor gleams


its keel has struck the sands beside our feet
then cythna turned to me and from her eyes
which swam with unshed tears a look more sweet
than happy love a wild and glad surprise
glanced as she spake ay this is paradise
and not a dream and we are all united
lo that is mine own child who in the guise
of madness came like day to one benighted
in lonesome woods my heart is now too well requited


and then she wept aloud and in her arms
clasped that bright shape less marvellously fair
than her own human hues and living charms
which as she leaned in passions silence there
breathed warmth on the cold bosom of the air
which seemed to blush and tremble with delight
the glossy darkness of her streaming hair
fell oer that snowy child and wrapped from sight
the fond and long embrace which did their hearts unite


then the bright child the plumed seraph came
and fixed its blue and beaming eyes on mine
and said i was disturbed by tremulous shame
when once we met yet knew that i was thine
from the same hour in which thy lips divine
kindled a clinging dream within my brain
which ever waked when i might sleep to twine
thine image with her memory dearagain
we meet exempted now from mortal fear or pain


when the consuming flames had wrapped ye round
the hope which i had cherished went away
i fell in agony on the senseless ground
and hid mine eyes in dust and far astray
my mind was gone when bright like dawning day
the spectre of the plague before me flew
and breathed upon my lips and seemed to say
they wait for thee belovedthen i knew
the deathmark on my breast and became calm anew


it was the calm of lovefor i was dying
i saw the black and halfextinguished pyre
in its own gray and shrunken ashes lying
the pitchy smoke of the departed fire
still hung in many a hollow dome and spire
above the towers like nightbeneath whose shade
awed by the ending of their own desire
the armies stood a vacancy was made
in expectations depth and so they stood dismayed


the frightful silence of that altered mood
the tortures of the dying clove alone
till one uprose among the multitude
and saidthe flood of time is rolling on
we stand upon its brink whilst they are gone
to glide in peace down deaths mysterious stream
have ye done well they moulder flesh and bone
who might have made this lifes envenomed dream
a sweeter draught than ye will ever taste i deem


these perish as the good and great of yore
have perished and their murderers will repent
yes vain and barren tears shall flow before
yon smoke has faded from the firmament
even for this cause that ye who must lament
the death of those that made this world so fair
cannot recall them now but there is lent
to man the wisdom of a high despair
when such can die and he live on and linger here


ay ye may fear not now the pestilence
from fabled hell as by a charm withdrawn
all power and faith must pass since calmly hence
in pain and fire have unbelievers gone
and ye must sadly turn away and moan
in secret to his home each one returning
and to long ages shall this hour be known
and slowly shall its memory ever burning
fill this dark night of things with an eternal morning


for me that world is grown too void and cold
since hope pursues immortal destiny
with steps thus slowtherefore shall ye behold
how those who love yet fear not dare to die
tell to your children this then suddenly
he sheathed a dagger in his heart and fell
my brain grew dark in death and yet to me
there came a murmur from the crowd to tell
of deep and mighty change which suddenly befell


then suddenly i stood a winged thought
before the immortal senate and the seat
of that starshining spirit whence is wrought
the strength of its dominion good and great
the better genius of this worlds estate
his realm around one mighty fane is spread
elysian islands bright and fortunate
calm dwellings of the free and happy dead
where i am sent to lead these winged words she said


and with the silence of her eloquent smile
bade us embark in her divine canoe
then at the helm we took our seat the while
above her head those plumes of dazzling hue
into the winds invisible stream she threw
sitting beside the prow like gossamer
on the swift breath of morn the vessel flew
oer the bright whirlpools of that fountain fair
whose shores receded fast while we seemed lingering there


till down that mighty stream dark calm and fleet
between a chasm of cedarn mountains riven
chased by the thronging winds whose viewless feet
as swift as twinkling beams had under heaven
from woods and waves wild sounds and odours driven
the boat fled visiblythree nights and days
borne like a cloud through morn and noon and even
we sailed along the winding watery ways
of the vast stream a long and labyrinthine maze


a scene of joy and wonder to behold
that rivers shapes and shadows changing ever
where the broad sunrise filled with deepening gold
its whirlpools where all hues did spread and quiver
and where melodious falls did burst and shiver
among rocks clad with flowers the foam and spray
sparkled like stars upon the sunny river
or when the moonlight poured a holier day
one vast and glittering lake around green islands lay


morn noon and even that boat of pearl outran
the streams which bore it like the arrowy cloud
of tempest or the speedier thought of man
which flieth forth and cannot make abode
sometimes through forests deep like night we glode
between the walls of mighty mountains crowned
with cyclopean piles whose turrets proud
the homes of the departed dimly frowned
oer the bright waves which girt their dark foundations round


sometimes between the wide and flowering meadows
mile after mile we sailed and twas delight
to see far off the sunbeams chase the shadows
over the grass sometimes beneath the night
of wide and vaulted caves whose roofs were bright
with starry gems we fled whilst from their deep
and darkgreen chasms shades beautiful and white
amid sweet sounds across our path would sweep
like swift and lovely dreams that walk the waves of sleep


and ever as we sailed our minds were full
of love and wisdom which would overflow
in converse wild and sweet and wonderful
and in quick smiles whose light would come and go
like music oer wide waves and in the flow
of sudden tears and in the mute caress
for a deep shade was cleft and we did know
that virtue though obscured on earth not less
survives all mortal change in lasting loveliness


three days and nights we sailed as thought and feeling
number delightful hoursfor through the sky
the sphered lamps of day and night revealing
new changes and new glories rolled on high
sun moon and moonlike lamps the progeny
of a diviner heaven serene and fair
on the fourth day wild as a windwrought sea
the stream became and fast and faster bare
the spiritwinged boat steadily speeding there


steady and swift where the waves rolled like mountains
within the vast ravine whose rifts did pour
tumultuous floods from their ten thousand fountains
the thunder of whose earthuplifting roar
made the air sweep in whirlwinds from the shore
calm as a shade the boat of that fair child
securely fled that rapid stress before
amid the topmost spray and sunbows wild
wreathed in the silver mist in joy and pride we smiled


the torrent of that wide and raging river
is passed and our aereal speed suspended
we look behind a golden mist did quiver
when its wild surges with the lake were blended
our bark hung there as on a line suspended
between two heavensthat windless waveless lake
which four great cataracts from four vales attended
by mists aye feed from rocks and clouds they break
and of that azure sea a silent refuge make


motionless resting on the lake awhile
i saw its marge of snowbright mountains rear
their peaks aloft i saw each radiant isle
and in the midst afar even like a sphere
hung in one hollow sky did there appear
the temple of the spirit on the sound
which issued thence drawn nearer and more near
like the swift moon this glorious earth around
the charmed boat approached and there its haven found


heigho the lark and the owl
one flies the morning and one lulls the night
only the nightingale poor fond soul
sings like the fool through darkness and light


a widow bird sate mourning for her love
upon a wintry bough
the frozen wind crept on above
the freezing stream below


there was no leaf upon the forest bare
no flower upon the ground
and little motion in the air
except the millwheels sound


art thou pale for weariness
of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth
wandering companionless
among the stars that have a different birth
and ever changing like a joyless eye
that finds no object worth its constancy


i bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers
from the seas and the streams
i bear light shade for the leaves when laid
in their noonday dreams
from my wings are shaken the dews that waken
the sweet buds every one
when rocked to rest on their mothers breast
as she dances about the sun
i wield the flail of the lashing hail
and whiten the green plains under
and then again i dissolve it in rain
and laugh as i pass in thunder


i sift the snow on the mountains below
and their great pines groan aghast
and all the night tis my pillow white
while i sleep in the arms of the blast
sublime on the towers of my skyey bowers
lightning my pilot sits
in a cavern under is fettered the thunder
it struggles and howls at fits
over earth and ocean with gentle motion
this pilot is guiding me
lured by the love of the genii that move
in the depths of the purple sea
over the rills and the crags and the hills
over the lakes and the plains
wherever he dream under mountain or stream
the spirit he loves remains
and i all the while bask in heavens blue smile
whilst he is dissolving in rains


the sanguine sunrise with his meteor eyes
and his burning plumes outspread
leaps on the back of my sailing rack
when the morning star shines dead
as on the jag of a mountain crag
which an earthquake rocks and swings
an eagle alit one moment may sit
in the light of its golden wings
and when sunset may breathe from the lit sea beneath
its ardors of rest and of love
and the crimson pall of eve may fall
from the depth of heaven above
with wings folded i rest on mine aery nest
as still as a brooding dove


that orbed maiden with white fire laden
whom mortals call the moon
glides glimmering oer my fleecelike floor
by the midnight breezes strewn
and wherever the beat of her unseen feet
which only the angels hear
may have broken the woof of my tents thin roof
the stars peep behind her and peer
and i laugh to see them whirl and flee
like a swarm of golden bees
when i widen the rent in my windbuilt tent
till the calm rivers lakes and seas
like strips of the sky fallen through me on high
are each paved with the moon and these


i bind the suns throne with a burning zone
and the moons with a girdle of pearl
the volcanoes are dim and the stars reel and swim
when the whirlwinds my banner unfurl
from cape to cape with a bridgelike shape
over a torrent sea
sunbeamproof i hang like a roof
the mountains its columns be
the triumphal arch through which i march
with hurricane fire and snow
when the powers of the air are chained to my chair
is the millioncolored bow
the spherefire above its soft colors wove
while the moist earth was laughing below


i am the daughter of earth and water
and the nursling of the sky
i pass through the pores of the ocean and shores
i change but i cannot die
for after the rain when with never a stain
the pavilion of heaven is bare
and the winds and sunbeams with their convex gleams
build up the blue dome of air
i silently laugh at my own cenotaph
and out of the caverns of rain
like a child from the womb like a ghost from the tomb
i arise and unbuild it again


the awful shadow of some unseen power
floats though unseen among usvisiting
this various world with as inconstant wing
as summer winds that creep from flower to flower
like moonbeams that behind some piny mountain shower
it visits with inconstant glance
each human heart and countenance
like hues and harmonies of evening
like clouds in starlight widely spread
like memory of music fled
like aught that for its grace may be
dear and yet dearer for its mystery


spirit of beauty that dost consecrate
with thine own hues all thou dost shine upon
of human thought or formwhere art thou gone
why dost thou pass away and leave our state
this dim vast vale of tears vacant and desolate
ask why the sunlight not for ever
weaves rainbows oer yon mountainriver
why aught should fail and fade that once is shown
why fear and dream and death and birth
cast on the daylight of this earth
such gloomwhy man has such a scope
for love and hate despondency and hope


no voice from some sublimer world hath ever
to sage or poet these responses given
therefore the names of demon ghost and heaven
remain the records of their vain endeavour
frail spellswhose uttered charm might not avail to sever
from all we hear and all we see
doubt chance and mutability
thy light alonelike mist oer mountains driven
or music by the nightwind sent
through strings of some still instrument
or moonlight on a midnight stream
gives grace and truth to lifes unquiet dream


love hope and selfesteem like clouds depart
and come for some uncertain moments lent
man were immortal and omnipotent
didst thou unknown and awful as thou art
keep with thy glorious train firm state within his heart
thou messenger of sympathies
that wax and wane in lovers eyes
thouthat to human thought art nourishment
like darkness to a dying flame
depart not as thy shadow came
depart notlest the grave should be
like life and fear a dark reality


while yet a boy i sought for ghosts and sped
through many a listening chamber cave and ruin
and starlight wood with fearful steps pursuing
hopes of high talk with the departed dead
i called on poisonous names with which our youth is fed
i was not heardi saw them not
when musing deeply on the lot
of life at that sweet time when winds are wooing
all vital things that wake to bring
news of birds and blossoming
sudden thy shadow fell on me
i shrieked and clasped my hands in ecstasy


i vowed that i would dedicate my powers
to thee and thinehave i not kept the vow
with beating heart and streaming eyes even now
i call the phantoms of a thousand hours
each from his voiceless grave they have in visioned bowers
of studious zeal or loves delight
outwatched with me the envious night
they know that never joy illumed my brow
unlinked with hope that thou wouldst free
this world from its dark slavery
that thouo awful loveliness
wouldst give whateer these words cannot express


the day becomes more solemn and serene
when noon is pastthere is a harmony
in autumn and a lustre in its sky
which through the summer is not heard or seen
as if it could not be as if it had not been
thus let thy power which like the truth
of nature on my passive youth
descended to my onward life supply
its calmto one who worships thee
and every form containing thee
whom spirit fair thy spells did bind
to fear himself and love all human kind


o thou who plumed with strong desire
wouldst float above the earth beware
a shadow tracks thy flight of fire
night is coming
bright are the regions of the air
and among the winds and beams
it were delight to wander there
night is coming


the deathless stars are bright above
if i would cross the shade of night
within my heart is the lamp of love
and that is day
and the moon will smile with gentle light
on my golden plumes whereer they move
the meteors will linger round my flight
and make night day


but if the whirlwinds of darkness waken
hail and lightning and stormy rain
see the bounds of the air are shaken
night is coming
the red swift clouds of the hurricane
yon declining sun have overtaken
the clash of the hail sweeps over the plain
night is coming
i see the light and i hear the sound
ill sail on the flood of the tempest dark
with the calm within and the light around
which makes night day
and thou when the gloom is deep and stark
look from thy dull earth slumberbound
my moonlike flight thou then mayst mark
on high far away


some say there is a precipice
where one vast pine is frozen to ruin
oer piles of snow and chasms of ice
mid alpine mountains
and that the languid storm pursuing
that winged shape for ever flies
round those hoar branches aye renewing
its aery fountains


some say when nights are dry and clear
and the deathdews sleep on the morass
sweet whispers are heard by the traveller
which make night day
and a silver shape like his early love doth pass
upborne by her wild and glittering hair
and when he awakes on the fragrant grass
he finds night day


o wild west wind thou breath of autumns being
thou from whose unseen presence the leaves dead
are driven like ghosts from an enchanter fleeing


yellow and black and pale and hectic red
pestilencestricken multitudeso thou
who chariotest to their dark wintry bed


the wingd seeds where they lie cold and low
each like a corpse within its grave until
thine azure sister of the spring shall blow


her clarion oer the dreaming earth and fill
driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air
with living hues and odours plain and hill
wild spirit which art moving everywhere
destroyer and preserverhear o hear


thou on whose stream mid the steep skys commotion
loose clouds like earths decaying leaves are shed
shook from the tangled boughs of heaven and ocean


angels of rain and lightning they are spread
on the blue surface of thine airy surge
like the bright hair uplifted from the head


of some fierce mnad evn from the dim verge
of the horizon to the zeniths height
the locks of the approaching storm thou dirge


of the dying year to which this closing night
will be the dome of a vast sepulchre
vaulted with all thy congregated might
of vapours from whose solid atmosphere
black rain and fire and hail will bursto hear


thou who didst waken from his summerdreams
the blue mediterranean where he lay
lulld by the coil of his crystalline streams


beside a pumice isle in bais bay
and saw in sleep old palaces and towers
quivering within the waves intenser day


all overgrown with azure moss and flowers
so sweet the sense faints picturing them thou
for whose path the atlantics level powers


cleave themselves into chasms while far below
the seablooms and the oozy woods which wear
the sapless foliage of the ocean know
thy voice and suddenly grow gray with fear
and tremble and despoil themselveso hear


if i were a dead leaf thou mightest bear
if i were a swift cloud to fly with thee
a wave to pant beneath thy power and share


the impulse of thy strength only less free
than thou o uncontrollableif even
i were as in my boyhood and could be


the comrade of thy wanderings over heaven
as then when to outstrip thy skiey speed
scarce seemd a visioni would neer have striven


as thus with thee in prayer in my sore need
o lift me as a wave a leaf a cloud
i fall upon the thorns of life i bleed
a heavy weight of hours has chaind and bowd
one too like theetameless and swift and proud


make me thy lyre evn as the forest is
what if my leaves are falling like its own
the tumult of thy mighty harmonies


will take from both a deep autumnal tone
sweet though in sadness be thou spirit fierce
my spirit be thou me impetuous one


drive my dead thoughts over the universe
like witherd leaves to quicken a new birth
and by the incantation of this verse


scatter as from an unextinguishd hearth
ashes and sparks my words among mankind
be through my lips to unawakend earth
the trumpet of a prophecy o wind
if winter comes can spring be far behind


hail to thee blithe spirit
bird thou never wert
that from heaven or near it
pourest thy full heart
in profuse strains of unpremeditated art


higher still and higher
from the earth thou springest
like a cloud of fire
the blue deep thou wingest
and singing still dost soar and soaring ever singest


in the golden lightning
of the sunken sun
oer which clouds are brightning
thou dost float and run
like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun


the pale purple even
melts around thy flight
like a star of heaven
in the broad daylight
thou art unseen but yet i hear thy shrill delight


keen as are the arrows
of that silver sphere
whose intense lamp narrows
in the white dawn clear
until we hardly see we feel that it is there


all the earth and air
with thy voice is loud
as when night is bare
from one lonely cloud
the moon rains out her beams and heaven is overflowd


what thou art we know not
what is most like thee
from rainbow clouds there flow not
drops so bright to see
as from thy presence showers a rain of melody


like a poet hidden
in the light of thought
singing hymns unbidden
till the world is wrought
to sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not


like a highborn maiden
in a palace tower
soothing her loveladen
soul in secret hour
with music sweet as love which overflows her bower


like a glowworm golden
in a dell of dew
scattering unbeholden
its arial hue
among the flowers and grass which screen it from the view


like a rose embowerd
in its own green leaves
by warm winds deflowerd
till the scent it gives
makes faint with too much sweet those heavywingd thieves


sound of vernal showers
on the twinkling grass
rainawakend flowers
all that ever was
joyous and clear and freshthy music doth surpass


teach us sprite or bird
what sweet thoughts are thine
i have never heard
praise of love or wine
that panted forth a flood of rapture so divine


chorus hymeneal
or triumphal chant
matchd with thine would be all
but an empty vaunt
a thin wherein we feel there is some hidden want


what objects are the fountains
of thy happy strain
what fields or waves or mountains
what shapes of sky or plain
what love of thine own kind what ignorance of pain


with thy clear keen joyance
languor cannot be
shadow of annoyance
never came near thee
thou lovest but neer knew loves sad satiety


waking or asleep
thou of death must deem
things more true and deep
than we mortals dream
or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream


we look before and after
and pine for what is not
our sincerest laughter
with some pain is fraught
our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought


yet if we could scorn
hate and pride and fear
if we were things born
not to shed a tear
i know not how thy joy we ever should come near


better than all measures
of delightful sound
better than all treasures
that in books are found
thy skill to poet were thou scorner of the ground


teach me half the gladness
that thy brain must know
such harmonious madness
from my lips would flow
the world should listen then as i am listening now


swift as a spirit hastening to his task
of glory of good the sun sprang forth
rejoicing in his splendour the mask


of darkness fell from the awakened earth
the smokeless altars of the mountain snows
flamed above crimson clouds at the birth


of light the oceans orison arose
to which the birds tempered their matin lay
all flowers in field or forest which unclose


their trembling eyelids to the kiss of day
swinging their censers in the element
with orient incense lit by the new ray


burned slow inconsumably sent
their odorous sighs up to the smiling air
and in succession due did continent


isle ocean all things that in them wear
the form character of mortal mould
rise as the sun their father rose to bear


their portion of the toil which he of old
took as his own then imposed on them
but i whom thoughts which must remain untold


had kept as wakeful as the stars that gem
the cone of night now they were laid asleep
stretched my faint limbs beneath the hoary stem


which an old chestnut flung athwart the steep
of a green apennine before me fled
the night behind me rose the day the deep


was at my feet heaven above my head
when a strange trance over my fancy grew
which was not slumber for the shade it spread


was so transparent that the scene came through
as clear as when a veil of light is drawn
oer evening hills they glimmer and i knew


that i had felt the freshness of that dawn
bathed in the same cold dew my brow hair
and sate as thus upon that slope of lawn


under the self same bough heard as there
the birds the fountains the ocean hold
sweet talk in music through the enamoured air
and then a vision on my brain was rolled


as in that trance of wondrous thought i lay
this was the tenour of my waking dream
methought i sate beside a public way


thick strewn with summer dust a great stream
of people there was hurrying to fro
numerous as gnats upon the evening gleam


all hastening onward yet none seemed to know
whither he went or whence he came or why
he made one of the multitude yet so


was borne amid the crowd as through the sky
one of the million leaves of summers bier
old age youth manhood infancy


mixed in one mighty torrent did appear
some flying from the thing they feared some
seeking the object of anothers fear


and others as with steps towards the tomb
pored on the trodden worms that crawled beneath
and others mournfully within the gloom


of their own shadow walked and called it death
and some fled from it as it were a ghost
half fainting in the affliction of vain breath


but more with motions which each other crost
pursued or shunned the shadows the clouds threw
or birds within the noonday ether lost


upon that path where flowers never grew
and weary with vain toil faint for thirst
heard not the fountains whose melodious dew


out of their mossy cells forever burst
nor felt the breeze which from the forest told
of grassy paths wood lawns interspersed


with overarching elms caverns cold
and violet banks where sweet dreams brood but they
pursued their serious folly as of old


and as i gazed methought that in the way
the throng grew wilder as the woods of june
when the south wind shakes the extinguished day


and a cold glare intenser than the noon
but icy cold obscured with blank light
the sun as he the stars like the young moon


when on the sunlit limits of the night
her white shell trembles amid crimson air
and whilst the sleeping tempest gathers might


doth as a herald of its coming bear
the ghost of her dead mother whose dim form
bends in dark ether from her infants chair


so came a chariot on the silent storm
of its own rushing splendour and a shape
so sate within as one whom years deform


beneath a dusky hood double cape
crouching within the shadow of a tomb
and oer what seemed the head a cloud like crape


was bent a dun faint etherial gloom
tempering the light upon the chariots beam
a janusvisaged shadow did assume


the guidance of that wonderwinged team
the shapes which drew it in thick lightnings
were lost i heard alone on the airs soft stream


the music of their ever moving wings
all the four faces of that charioteer
had their eyes banded little profit brings


speed in the van blindness in the rear
nor then avail the beams that quench the sun
or that his banded eyes could pierce the sphere


of all that is has been or will be done
so ill was the car guided but it past
with solemn speed majestically on


the crowd gave way i arose aghast
or seemed to rise so mighty was the trance
and saw like clouds upon the thunder blast


the million with fierce song and maniac dance
raging around such seemed the jubilee
as when to greet some conquerors advance


imperial rome poured forth her living sea
from senatehouse prison theatre
when freedom left those who upon the free


had bound a yoke which soon they stooped to bear
nor wanted here the true similitude
of a triumphal pageant for whereer


the chariot rolled a captive multitude
was driven althose who had grown old in power
or miseryall who have their age subdued


by action or by suffering and whose hour
was drained to its last sand in weal or woe
so that the trunk survived both fruit flower


all those whose fame or infamy must grow
till the great winter lay the form name
of their own earth with them forever low


all but the sacred few who could not tame
their spirits to the conqueror but as soon
as they had touched the world with living flame


fled back like eagles to their native noon
of those who put aside the diadem
of earthly thrones or gems till the last one


were therefor they of athens jerusalem
were neither mid the mighty captives seen
nor mid the ribald crowd that followed them


or fled before now swift fierce obscene
the wild dance maddens in the van those
who lead it fleet as shadows on the green


outspeed the chariot without repose
mix with each other in tempestuous measure
to savage music wilder as it grows


they tortured by the agonizing pleasure
convulsed on the rapid whirlwinds spun
of that fierce spirit whose unholy leisure


was soothed by mischief since the world begun
throw back their heads loose their streaming hair
and in their dance round her who dims the sun


maidens youths fling their wild arms in air
as their feet twinkle they recede and now
bending within each others atmosphere


kindle invisibly and as they glow
like moths by light attracted repelled
oft to new bright destruction come go


till like two clouds into one vale impelled
that shake the mountains when their lightnings mingle
and die in rainthe fiery band which held


their natures snaps ere the shock cease to tingle
one falls and then another in the path
senseless nor is the desolation single


yet ere i can say where the chariot hath
past over them nor other trace i find
but as of foam after the oceans wrath


is spent upon the desert shorebehind
old men and women foully disarrayed
shake their grey hair in the insulting wind


limp in the dance strain with limbs decayed
seeking to reach the light which leaves them still
farther behind deeper in the shade


but not the less with impotence of will
they wheel though ghastly shadows interpose
round them round each other and fulfill


their work and to the dust whence they arose
sink corruption veils them as they lie
and frost in these performs what fire in those


struck to the heart by this sad pageantry
half to myself i said and what is this
whose shape is that within the car why


i would have addedis all here amiss
but a voice answered life i turned knew
o heaven have mercy on such wretchedness


that what i thought was an old root which grew
to strange distortion out of the hill side
was indeed one of that deluded crew


and that the grass which methought hung so wide
and white was but his thin discoloured hair
and that the holes it vainly sought to hide


were or had been eyeslf thou canst forbear
to join the dance which i had well forborne
said the grim feature of my thought aware


louing in trueth and fayne in verse my loue to show
that she deare shee might take som pleasure of my paine
pleasure might cause her reade reading might make her know
knowledge might pittie winne and pity grace obtaine
i sought fit wordes to paint the blackest face of woe
studying inuentions fine her wits to entertaine
oft turning others leaues to see if thence would flow
some fresh and fruitfull showers vpon my sunburnd brain
but words came halting forth wanting inuentions stay
inuention natures childe fledde stepdame studies blowes
and others feet still seemde but strangers in my way
thus great with childe to speak and helplesse in my throwes
biting my trewand pen beating myselfe for spite
fool said my muse to me looke in thy heart and write


not at the first sight nor with a dribbed shot
loue gaue the wound which while i breathe will bleede
but knowne worth did in tract of time proceed
till by degrees it had full conquest got
i saw and likd i likd but loued not
i loud but straight did not what loue decreed
at length to loues decrees i forcd agreed
yet with repining at so partiall lot
now euen that footstep of lost libertie
is gone and now like slaueborne muscouite
i call it praise to suffer tyrannie
and nowe imploy the remnant of my wit
to make myselfe beleeue that all is well
while with a feeling skill i paint my hell


let dainty wits crie on the sisters nine
that brauely maskt their fancies may be told
or pindars apes flaunt they in phrases fine
enamling with pied flowers their thoughts of gold
or else let them in statlier glorie shine
ennobling newfound tropes with problemes old
or with strange similes enrich each line
of herbes or beasts which inde or affrick hold
for me in sooth no muse but one i know
phrases and problems from my reach do grow
and strange things cost too deare for my poor sprites
how then euen thus in stellaes face i reed
what loue and beautie be then all my deed
but copying is what in her nature writes


vertue alas now let me take some rest
thou setst a bate betweene my will and wit
if vaine loue haue my simple soule opprest
leaue what thou likst not deale thou not with it
thy scepter vse in some old catoes brest
churches or schooles are for thy seat more fit
i do confesse pardon a fault confest
my mouth too tender is for thy hard bit
but if that needes thou wilt vsurping be
the little reason that is left in me
and still theffect of thy perswasions prooue
i sweare my heart such one shall show to thee
that shrines in flesh so true a deitie
that virtue thou thyself shalt be in loue


it is most true that eyes are formd to serue
the inward light and that the heauenly part
ought to be king from whose rules who do swerue
rebels to nature striue for their owne smart
it is most true what we call cupids dart
an image is which for ourselues we carue
and foolse adore in temple of our hart
till that good god make church and churchmen starue
true that true beautie virtue is indeed
whereof this beautie can be but a shade
which elements with mortal mixture breed
true that on earth we are but pilgrims made
and should in soule up to our countrey moue
true and yet true that i must stella loue


some louers speake when they their muses entertaine
of hopes begot by feare of wot not what desires
of force of heaunly beames infusing hellish paine
of liuing deaths dere wounds faire storms and freesing fires
some one his song in ioue and ioues strange tales attires
bordred with buls and swans powdred with golden raine
another humbler wit to shepherds pipe retires
yet hiding royall bloud full oft in rurall vaine
to some a sweetest plaint a sweetest stile affords
while teares poure out his inke and sighes breathe out his words
his paper pale despaire and pain his pen doth moue
i can speake what i feele and feele as much as they
but thinke that all the map of my state i display
when trembling voyce brings forth that i do stella loue


when nature made her chief worke stellas eyes
in colour blacke why wrapt she beames so bright
would she in beamy blacke like painter wise
frame daintiest lustre mixt of shades and light
or did she else that sober hue deuise
in obiect best to knitt and strength our sight
least if no vaile these braue gleames did disguise
they sunlike should more dazle then delight
or would she her miraculous power show
that whereas blacke seems beauties contrary
she euen in black doth make all beauties flow
both so and thus she minding loue should be
placd euer there gaue him this mourning weede
to honour all their deaths who for her bleed

haue i caught my heaunly iewell
teaching sleepe most faire to be
now will i teach her that she
when she wakes is tootoo cruell


since sweet sleep her eyes hath charmed
the two only darts of loue
now will i with that boy proue
some play while he is disamed


her tongue waking still refuseth
giuing frankly niggard no
now will i attempt to know
what no her tongue sleeping vseth


see the hand that waking gardeth
sleeping grants a free resort
now i will inuade the fort
cowards loue with losse rewardeth


but o foole thinke of the danger
of her iust and high disdaine
now will i alas refraine
loue feares nothing else but anger


yet those lips so sweetly swelling
do inuite a stealing kisse
now will i but venture this
who will reade must first learne spelling


oh sweet kisse but ah shes waking
lowring beautie chastens me
now will i for feare hence flee
foole more foole for no more taking


if orpheus voyce had force to breathe such musickes loue
through pores of senceles trees as it could make them moue
if stones good measure dauncd the theban walles to build
to cadence of the tunes which amphions lyre did yeeld
more cause a like effect at leastwise bringeth
o stones o trees learne hearingstella singeth


if loue might sweeten so a boy of shepheard brood
to make a lyzard dull to taste loues dainty food
if eagle fierce could so in grecian mayde delight
as her eyes were his light her death his endlesse night
earth gaue that loue heaun i trow loue refineth
o birds o beasts looke loue lo stella shineth


the beasts birds stones and trees feele this and feeling loue
and if the trees nor stones stirre not the same to proue
nor beasts nor birds do come vnto this blessed gaze
know that small loue is quicke and great loue doth amaze
they are amazd but you with reason armed
o eyes o eares of men how you are charmed


onely ioy now here you are
fit to heare and ease my care
let my whispering voyce obtaine
sweete reward for sharpest paine
take me to thee and thee to mee
no no no no my deare let bee


night hath closde all in her cloke
twinkling starres louethoughts prouoke
danger hence good care doth keepe
iealouzie hemselfe doth sleepe
take me to thee and thee to mee

better place no wit can finde
cupids knot to loose or binde
these sweet flowers our fine bed too
vs in their best language woo
take me to thee and thee to mee
no no no no my deare let bee


this small light the moone bestowes
serues thy beames but to disclose
so to raise my hap more hie
feare not else none vs can spie
take me to thee and thee to mee
no no no no my deare let bee


that you heard was but a mouse
dumbe sleepe holdeth all the house
yet asleepe me thinkes they say
yong fooles take time while you may
take me to thee and thee to mee
no no no no my deare let bee


niggard time threates if we misse
this large offer of our blisse
long stay ere he graunt the same
sweet then while ech thing doth frame
take me to thee and thee to mee
no no no no my deare let bee


your faire mother is abed
candles out and curtaines spred
she thinkes you do letters write
write but first let me endite
take me to thee and thee to mee
no no no no my deare let bee


sweete alas why striue you thus
concord better fitteth vs
leaue to mars the force of hands
your power in your beautie stands
take me to thee and thee to mee
no no no no my deare let bee


wo to mee and do you sweare
me to hate but i forbeare
cursed be my destines all
that brought me so high to fall
soone with my death i will please thee
no no no no my deare let bee


while fauour fed my hope delight with hope was brought
thought waited on delight and speech did follow thought
then grew my tongue and pen records vnto thy glory
i thought all words were lost that were not spent of thee
i thought each place was darke but where thy lights would be
and all eares worse than deaf that heard not out thy storie


i said thou wert most faire and so indeed thou art
i said thou wert most sweet sweet poison to my heart
i said my soule was thine o that i then had lyed
i said thine eyes were starres thy breast the milken way
thy fingers cupids shafts thy voyce the angels lay
and all i said so well as no man it denied


but now that hope is lost vnkindnesse kils delight
yet thought and speech do liue though metamorphosd quite
for rage now rules the raines which guided were by pleasure
i thinke now of thy faults who late thought of thy praise
that speech falles now to blame which did thy honour raise
the same key open can which can lock vp a treasure


then thou whom partiall heauens conspird in one to frame
the proofe of beauties worth thinheritrix of fame
the mansion seat of blisse and iust excuse of louers
see now those feathers pluckt wherewith thou flewst most high
see what cloudes of reproach shall dark thy honours skie
whose owne fault cast him downe hardly high state recouers


and o my muse though oft you luld her in your lap
and then a heaunly child gaue her ambrosian pap
and to that braine of hers your kindest gifts infused
since she disdaining me doth you in me disdaine
suffer not her to laugh while both we suffer paine
princes in subiects wrong must deeme themselues abused


your client poore my selfe shall stella handle so
reuenge revenge my muse defiance trumpet blow
threaten what may be done yet do more then you threaten
ah my sute granted is i feele my breast doth swell
no child a lesson new you shall begin to spell
sweet babes must babies haue but shrewd gyrles must be beaten


thinke now no more to heare of warme fineodourd snow
nor blushing lillies nor pearles rubyhidden row
nor of that golden sea whose waues in curles are broken
but of thy soule so fraught with such vngratefulnesse
as where thou soone mightst helpe most faith dost most oppresse
vngratefull who is cald the worst of euils is spoken


yet worse then worst i say thou art a theefe a theefe
now god forbid a theefe and of wurst theeues the cheefe
theeues steal for need and steale but goods which paine recouers
but thou rich in all ioyes dost rob my ioyes from me
which cannot be restord by time or industrie
of foes the spoyle is euill far worse of constant louers


yetgentle english theeues do rob but will not slay
thou english murdring theefe wilt haue harts for thy prey
the name of murdrer now on thy faire forehead sitteth
and euen while i do speake my death wounds bleeding be
which i protest proceed from only cruell thee
who may and will not saue murder in truth committeth


but murder priuate fault seemes but a toy to thee
i lay then to thy charge vniustest tyrannie
if rule by force without all claim a tyran showeth
for thou dost lord my heart who am not borne thy slaue
and which is worse makes me most guiltlesse torments haue
a rightfull prince by vnright deeds a tyran groweth


lo you grow proud with this for tyrans make folke bow
of foule rebellion then i do appeach thee now
rebell by natures law rebell by law of reason
thou sweetest subiect wert borne in the realme of loue
and yet against thy prince thy force dost daily proue
no vertue merits praise once toucht with blot of treason


but valiant rebels oft in fooles mouths purchase fame
i now then staine thy white with vagabonding shame
both rebell to the sonne and vagrant from the mother
for wearing venus badge in euery part of thee
vnto dianaes traine thou runnaway didst flie
who faileth one is false though trusty to another


what is not this enough nay farre worse commeth here
a witch i say thou art though thou so faire appeare
for i protest my sight neuer thy face enioyeth
but i in me am changd i am aliue and dead
my feete are turnd to rootes my hart becommeth lead
no witchcraft is so euill as which mans mind destroyeth


yet witches may repent thou art farre worse then they
alas that i am forst such euill of thee to say
i say thou art a diuell though clothd in angels shining
for thy face tempts my soule to leaue the heauens for thee
and thy words of refuse do powre euen hell on mee
who tempt and tempting plague are diuels in true defining


you then vngrateful theefe you murdring tyran you
you rebell runaway to lord and lady vntrue
you witch you diuell alas you still of me beloued
you see what i can say mend yet your froward mind
and such skill in my muse you reconcild shall find
that all these cruell words your praises shalbe proued


o you that heare this voice
o you that see this face
say whether of the choice
deserues the former place
feare not to iudge this bate
for it is void of hate


this side doth beauty take
for that doth musike speake
fit oratours to make
the strongest iudgements weake
the barre to plead their right
is only true delight


thus doth the voice and face
these gentle lawiers wage
like louing brothers case
for fathers heritage
that each while each contends
it selfe to other lends


for beautie beautifies
with heaunly hew and grace
the heaunly harmonies
and in this faultlesse face
the perfect beauties be
a perfect harmony


musick more loftly swels
in speeches nobly placd
beauty as farre excels
in action aptly gracd
a friend each party draws
to countenance his cause


loue more affected seemes
to beauties louely light
and wonder more esteemes
of musickes wondrous might
but both to both so bent
as both in both are spent


musicke doth witnesse call
the eare his truth to trie
beauty brings to the hall
eyeiudgement of the eye
both in their obiects such
as no exceptions tutch


the common sense which might
be arbiter of this
to be forsooth vpright
to both sides partiall is
he layes on this chiefe praise
chiefe praise on that he laies


then reason princesse hy
whose throne is in the minde
which musicke can in sky
and hidden beauties finde
say whether thou wilt crowne
with limitlesse renowne


whose senses in so euill consort their stepdame nature laies
that rauishing delight in them most sweete tunes do not raise
or if they do delight therein yet are so closde with wit
as with ententious lips to set a title vaine on it
o let them heare these sacred tunes and learne in wonders scholes
to be in things past bounds of wit fooles if they be not fooles


who haue so leaden eyes as not to see sweet beauties show
or seeing haue so wooden wits as not that worth to know
or knowing haue so muddy minds as not to be in loue
or louing haue so frothy thoughts as easly thence to moue
o let them see these heaunly beames and in faire letters reede
a lesson fit both sight and skill loue and firme loue to breede


heare then but then with wonder heare see but adoring see
no mortall gifts no earthly fruites now here descended be
see doo you see this face a face nay image of the skies
of which the two lifegiuing lights are figurd in her eyes
heare you this souleinuading voice and count it but a voice
the very essence of their tunes when angels do reioyce


in a groue most rich of shade
where birds wanton musicke made
maie then yong his pide weedes showing
newperfumd with flowers fresh growing


astrophel with stella sweet
did for mutual comfort meete
both within themselues oppressed
but each in the other blessed


him great harmes had taught much care
her faire necke a foule yoke bare
but her sight his cares did banish
in his sight her yoke did vanish


wept they had alas the while
but now teares themselues did smile
while their eyes by loue directed
enterchangeably reflected


sigh they did but now betwixt
sighes of woe were glad sighes mixt
with arms crost yet testifying
restlesse rest and liuing dying


their eares hungrie of each word
which the deare tongue would afford
but their tongues restraind from walking
till their harts had ended talking


but when their tongues could not speake
loue it selfe did silence breake
loue did set his lips asunder
thus to speake in loue and wonder


stella soueraigne of my ioy
faire triumpher of annoy
stella starre of heauenly fier
stella loadstar of desier


stella in whose shining eyes
are the lights of cupids skies
whose beames where they once are darted
loue therewith is streight imparted


stella whose voice when it speakes
senses all asunder breakes
stella whose voice when it singeth
angels to acquaintance bringeth


stella in whose body is
writ each caracter of blisse
whose face all all beauty passeth
saue thy mind which it surpasseth


graunt o graunt but speach alas
failes me fearing on to passe
graunt o me what am i saying
but no fault there is in praying


graunt o deere on knees i pray
knees on ground he then did stay
that not i but since i loue you
time and place for me may moue you


neuer season was more fit
never roome more apt for it
smiling ayre allowes my reason
these birds sing now vse the season


this small wind which so sweete is
see how it the leaues doth kisse
each tree in his best attiring
sense of loue to loue inspiring


loue makes earth the water drink
loue to earth makes water sinke
and if dumbe things be so witty
shall a heauenly grace want pitty


there his hands in their speech faine
would haue made tongues language plaine
but her hands his hands repelling
gaue repulse all grace expelling


then she spake her speech was such
so not eares but hart did tuch
while suchwise she loue denied
and yet loue she signified


astrophel sayd she my loue
cease in these effects to proue
now be still yet still beleeue me
thy griefe more then death would grieue me


if that any thought in me
can tast comfort but of thee
let me fed with hellish anguish
ioylesse hopelesse endlesse languish


if those eyes you praised be
halfe so deare as you to me
let me home returne starke blinded
of those eyes and blinder minded


if to secret of my hart
i do any wish impart
where thou art not formost placed
be both wish and i defaced


if more may be sayd i say
all my blisse in thee i lay
if thou loue my loue content thee
for all loue all faith is meant thee


trust me while i thee deny
in my selfe the smart i try
tyran honour doth thus vse thee
stellas selfe might not refuse thee


therefore deare this no more moue
least though i leaue not thy loue
which too deep in me is framed
i should blush when thou art named


therewithall away she went
leauing him to passion rent
with what she had done and spoken
that therewith my song is broken


go my flocke go get you hence
seeke a better place of feeding
where you may haue some defence
fro the stormes in my breast breeding
and showers from mine eyes proceeding


leaue a wretch in whom all wo
can abide to keepe no measure
merry flocke such one forego
vnto whom mirth is displeasure
onely rich in mischiefs treasure


yet alas before you go
heare your wofull maisters story
which to stones i els would show
sorrow only then hath glory
when tis excellently sorry


stella fiercest shepherdesse
fiercest but yet fairest euer
stella whom o heauens still blesse
though against me she perseuer
though i blisse enherit neuer


stella hath refused me
stella who more loue hath proued
in this caitife heart to be
then can in good eawes be moued
toward lambkins best beloued


stella hath refused me
astrophell that so well served
in this pleasant spring must see
while in pride flowers be preserued
himselfe onely wintersterued


why alas doth she then sweare
that she loueth me so dearely
seeing me so long to beare
coles of loue that burne so cleerly
and yet leaue me helplesse meerely


is that loue forsooth i trow
if i saw my good dog grieued
and a helpe for him did know
my loue should not be beleeued
but he were by me releeued


no she hates me wellaway
faining loue somewhat to please me
for she knows if she display
all her hate death soone would seaze me
and of hideous torments ease me


then adieu deare flocke adieu
but alas if in your straying
heauenly stella meete with you
tell her in your pitious blaying
her poore slaues vniust decaying


o deare life when shall it bee
that mine eyes thine eyes shall see
and in them thy mind discouer
whether absence haue had force
thy remembrance to diuorce
from the image of thy louer


or if i my self find not
after parting aught forgot
nor debard from beauties treasure
let not tongue aspire to tell
in what high ioyes i shall dwell
only thought aymes at the pleasure


thought therefore i will send thee
to take vp the place for me
long i will not after tary
there vnseene thou mayst be bold
those faire wonders to behold
which in them my hopes do cary


thought see thou no place forbeare
enter brauely euerywhere
seize on all to her belonging
but if thou wouldst garded be
fearing her beames take with thee
strength of liking rage of longing


thinke of that most gratefull time
when my leaping heart will climb
in thy lips to haue his biding
there those roses for to kisse
which do breathe a sugred blisse
opening rubies pearles diuiding


thinke of my most princely powr
which i blessed shall deuowr
with my greedy licorous sences
beauty musicke sweetnesse loue
while she doth against me proue
her strong darts but weake defences


thinke thinke of those dalyings
when with douelike murmurings
with glad moning passed anguish
we change eyes and hart for hart
each to other do depart
ioying till ioy makes vs languish


o my thoughts my thoughts surcease
thy delights my woes increse
my life melts with too much thinking
thinke no more but die in me
till thou shalt reuiued be
at her lips my nectar drinking


who is it that this darke night
vnderneath my window playneth
it is one who from thy sight
being ah exild disdayneth
euery other vulgar light


why alas and are you he
be not yet those fancies changed
deare when you find change in me
though from me you be estranged
let my chaunge to ruin be


well in absence this will dy
leaue to see and leaue to wonder
absence sure will helpe if
can learne how my selfe to sunder
from what in my hart doth ly


but time will these thoughts remoue
time doth work what no man knoweth
time doth as the subiect proue
with time still the affection groweth
in the faithful turtledoue


what if we new beauties see
will they not stir new affection
i will thinke they pictures be
imagelike of saints perfection
poorely counterfeting thee


but your reasons purest light
bids you leaue such minds to nourish
deere do reason no such spite
neuer doth thy beauty florish
more then in my reasons sight


but the wrongs loue beares will make
loue at length leaue vndertaking
no the more fooles it doth shake
in a ground of so firme making
deeper still they driue the stake


peace i thinke that some giue eare
come no more least i get anger
blisse i will my blisse forbeare
fearing sweete you to endanger
but my soule shall harbour there


well be gone be gone i say
lest that argus eyes perceiue you
o vniust is fortunes sway
which can make me thus to leaue you
and from lowts to run away


finding those beams which i must ever love
to mar my mind and with my hurt to please
i deemd it best some absence for to prove
if farther place might further me to ease
my eyes thence drawn where livèd all their light
blinded forthwith in dark despair did lie
like to the mole with want of guiding sight
deep plungd in earth deprivèd of the sky
in absence blind and wearied with that woe
to greater woes by presence i return
even as the fly which to the flame doth go
pleasd with the light that his small corse doth burn
fair choice i have either to live or die
a blinded mole or else a burnèd fly


the darte the beames the stringe so stronge i proue
whiche my chefe parte dothe passe throughe parche and tye
that of the stroke the heat and knott of loue
wounded inflamde knitt to the deathe i dye
hardned and coulde farr from affectiones snare
was once my mynde my temper and my lyfe
while i that syghte desyre and vowe forbare
whiche to auoide quenche loose noughte booted stryfe
yet will not i greife ashes thralldom change
for others ease their frutte or free estate
so braue a shott cleere fyre and bewtye strange
bid me pearce burne and bynde longe time and late
and in my woundes my flames and bondes i fynd
a salue freshe ayre and bryghte contented mynde


my mistresse lowers and saith i do not loue
i do protest and seeke with seruice due
in humble mind a constant faith to proue
but for all this i cannot her remoue
from deepe vaine thought that i may not be true


if othes might serue euen by the stygian lake
which poets say the gods themselues do feare
i neuer did my vowèd word forsake
for why should i whom free choise slaue doth make
elsewhat in face than in my fancie bear


my muse therefore for onely thou canst tell
tell me the cause of this my causelesse woe
tell how ill thought disgracd my doing well
tell how my ioyes and hopes thus fowly fell
a e to so lowe ebbe that wonted were to flowe


o this it isthe knotted straw is found
in tender harts small things engender hate
a horses worth laid wast the troian ground
a threefoote stoole in greece made trumpets sound
b an asses shade eer now hath bred debate


if greekes themselues were moud with so small cause
to twist those broyles which hardly would vntwine
should ladies faire be tyed to such hard lawes
as in their moodes to take a lingring pawse
b e i would it not their metall is too fine


my hand doth not beare witnesse with my hart
she saith because i make no woful laies
to paint my liuing death and endlesse smart
and so for one that felt god cupids dart
c she thinkes i leade and liue too merrie daies


are poets then the onely louers true
whose hearts are set on measuring a verse
who think themselues well blest if they renew
some good old dumpe that chaucers mistresse knew
c e and vse but you for matters to rehearse


then good apollo do away thy bowe
take harp and sing in this our versing time
and in my braine some sacred humour flowe
that all the earth my woes sighs teares may know
d and see you not that i fall now to ryme


as for my mirth how could i but be glad
whilst that methought i iustly made my boast
that only i the only mistresse had
but now if ere my face with ioy be clad
thinke hannibal did laugh when carthage lost


sweet ladie as for those whose sullen cheare
compard to me made me in lightnesse sound
who stoicklike in clowdie hew appeare
who silence force to make their words more deare
whose eyes seem chaste because they looke on ground


beleeue them not for physick true doth finde
cholor adust is ioyed in womankinde


dick since we cannot dance come let a chearefull voyce
shew that we do not grudge at all when others do rejoyce
ah will though i grudge not i count it feeble glee
with sight made dymme with dayly teares anothers sport to see
whoeuer lambkins saw yet lambkins loue to play
to play when that their louèd dammes are stoln or gone astray
if this in them be true as true in men think i
a lustles song forsooth thinks hee that hath more lust to cry
a tyme there is for all my mother often sayes
when she with skirts tuckt very hy with girles at stoolball playes


when thou hast mynd to weepe seeke out some smoky room
now let those lightsomme sights we see thy darknes ouercome
what ioy the ioyfull sunne giues vnto blearèd eyes
that comfort in these sports you like my mynde his comfort tryes
what is thy bagpipe broke or are thy lambs miswent
thy wallet or thy tarbox lost or thy new rayment rent
i would it were but thus for thus it were too well
thou seest my eares do itch at it good dick thy sorow tell
hear then and learne to sigh a mistress i do serue
whose wages makes me beg the more who feeds me till i sterue
whose lyueries such as most i freeze apparelled most
and lookes so neere vnto my cure that i must needes be lost
what these are riddles sure art thou then bound to her
bound as i neither power haue nor would haue power to stir


remembrance is the chest
lockte fast with knowing that she is of worldly things the best
thou late of wages playndst what wages mayst thou haue
her heauenly looks which more and more do giue me cause to craue
if wages make you want what food is that she giues
teares drink sorrowes meat wherewith not i but in me my death liues


hir care is to preuent
my freedom with show of hir beames with virtue my content
god shield vs from such dames if so our downes be sped
the shepheards will grow leane i trow their sheep will ill be fed
but dick my counsell marke run from the place of woe
the arrow being shot from far doth giue the smaller blowe
good will i cannot take thy good aduice before
that foxes leaue to steale because they finde they dy therefore
then dick let vs go hence lest wee great folkes annoy
for nothing can more tedious bee then plaint in time of joy
oh hence o cruell word which euen doggs do hate
but hence euen hence i must needes go such is my doggèd fate


walking in bright phœbus blaze
where with heat oppresst i was
i got to a shady wood
where greene leaues did newly bud
and of grass was plenty dwelling
deckt with pyde flowers sweetely smelling


in this wood a man i met
on lamenting wholly set
rewing change of wonted state
whence he was transformèd late
once to shepheards god retayning
now in servile court remayning
there he wandring malecontent
vp and down perplexèd went
daring not to tell to mee
spake vnto a senceless tree
one among the rest electing
these same words or this effecting
my old mates i grieue to see
b voyde of me in field to bee
where we once our louely sheepe
louingly like friends did keepe
oft each others friendship prouing
neuer striuing but in louing


but may loue abiding bee
in poore shepheards base degree
it belongs to such alone
to whom arte of loue is knowne
seely shepheards are not witting
what in art of loue is fitting
nay what neede the arte to those
to whom we our loue disclose
it is to be vsèd then
when we doe but flatter men


friendship true in hart assurèd
is by natures giftes procurèd
therefore shepheardes wanting skill
can loues duties best fulfill
since they know not how to faine
nor with loue to cloake disdaine
like the wiser sort whose learning
hides their inward will of harming
well was i while vnder shade
oten reedes me musicke made


striuing with my mates in song
mixing mirth our songs among
greater was the shepheards treasure
then this false fine courtly pleasure
where how many creatures be
so many pufft in minde i see
like to junoes birdes of pride
scarce each other can abide
friends like to blacke swannes appearing
sooner these than those in hearing


therefore pan if thou mayst be
made to listen vnto me
grant i say if seely man
may make treaty to god pan
that i without thy denying
may be still to thee relying
only for my two loues sake
in whose loue i pleasure take


only two do me delight
with their euerpleasing sight
of all men to thee retaining
grant me with those two remaining
so shall i to thee alwayes
with my reedes sound mighty praise
and first lambe that shall befall
yearely deck thine alter shall


if it please thee be reflected
and i from thee not reiected
so i left him in that place
taking pity on his case
learning this among the rest
that the meane estate is best
better fillèd with contenting
voyde of wishing and repenting


vertue beautie and speeche did strike wound charme
my heart eyes eares with wonder loue delight
first second last did binde enforce and arme
his works showes sutes with wit grace and vowes might
thus honour liking trust much farre and deepe
held pearst possesst my iudgment sence and will
till wrongs contempt deceite did grow steale creepe
bands fauour faith to breake defile and kill
then griefe vnkindnes proofe tooke kindled taught
wellgrounded noble due spite rage disdaine
but ah alas in vaine my minde sight thought
doth him his face his words leaue shunne refraine
for nothing time nor place can loose quench ease
mine owne embracèd sought knot fire disease


to one whose state is raised over all
whose face doth oft the bravest sort enchant
whose mind is such as wisest minds appal
who in one self these diverse gifts can plant
how dare i wretch seek there my woes to rest
where ears be burnt eyes dazzled hearts oppressed


your state is great your greatness is our shield
your face hurts oft but still it doth delight
your mind is wise your wisdom makes you mild
such planted gifts enrich een beggars sight
so dare i wretch my bashful fear subdue
and feed mine ears mine eyes my heart in you


therion come espilus come now declare thy skill
show how thou canst deserve so brave desire
warm well thy wits if thou wilt win her will
for water cold did never promise fire
great sure is she on whom our hopes do live
greater is she who must the judgement give


espilus tune up my voice a higher note i yield
to high conceits the song must needs be high
more high than stars more firm than flinty field
are all my thoughts in which i live or die
sweet soul to whom i vowed am a slave
let not wild woods so great a treasure have


therion the highest note comes oft from basest mind
as shallow brooks do yield the greatest sound
seek other thoughts thy life or death to find
thy stars be falln ploughed is thy flinty ground
sweet soul let not a wretch that serveth sheep
among his flock so sweet a treasure keep


espilus two thousand sheep i have as white as milk
though not so white as is thy lovely face
the pasture rich the wool as soft as silk
all this i give let me possess thy grace
but still take heed lest thou thyself submit
to one that hath no wealth and wants his wit


therion two thousand deer in wildest woods i have
them can i take but you i cannot hold
he is not poor who can his freedom save
bound but to you no wealth but you i would
but take this beast if beasts you fear to miss
for of his beasts the greatest beast he is


espilus judge you to whom all beautys force is lent
therion judge you of love to whom all love is bent


espilus silvanus long in love and long in vain
at length obtained the point of his desire
when being asked now that he did obtain
his wished weal what more he could require
nothing said he for most i joy in this
that goddess mine my blessed being sees


therion when wanton pan deceived with lions skin
came to the bed where wound for kiss he got
to woe and shame the wretch did enter in
till this he took for comfort of his lot
poor pan he said although thou beaten be
it is no shame since hercules was he


espilus thus joyful i in chosen tunes rejoice
that such a one is witness of my heart
whose clearest eyes i bliss and sweetest voice
that see my good and judgeth my desert
therion thus woeful i in woe this salve do find
my foul mishap came yet from fairest mind


leave me o love which reachest but to dust
and thou my mind aspire to higher things
grow rich in that which never taketh rust
whatever fades but fading pleasure brings
draw in thy beams and humble all thy might
to that sweet yoke where lasting freedoms be
which breaks the clouds and opens forth the light
that doth both shine and give us sight to see
o take fast hold let that light be thy guide
in this small course which birth draws out to death
and think how ill becometh him to slide
who seeketh heavn and comes of heavnly breath
then farewell world thy uttermost i see
eternal love maintain thy life in me


like as the dove which seeledup doth fly
is neither freed nor yet to service bound
but hopes to gain some help by mounting high
till want of force doth force her fall to ground
right so my mind caught by his guiding eye
and thence cast off where his sweet hurt he found
hath neither leave to live nor doom to die
nor held in ill nor suffered to be sound
but with his wings of fancies up he goes
to high conceits whose fruits are oft but small
till wounded blind and wearied spirits lose
both force to fly and knowledge where to fall
o happy dove if she no bondage tried
more happy i might i in bondage bide


ah poore loue whi dost thou liue
thus to se thy seruice lost
ife she will no comforte geue
make an end yeald vp the goaste
that she may at lengthe aproue
that she hardlye long beleued
that the harte will dye for loue
that is not in tyme relieued


ohe that euer i was borne
seruice so to be refused
faythfull loue to be foreborne
neuer loue was so abused
but swet loue be still a whylle
she that hurte thee loue maye healle thee
sweet i see within her smylle
more than reason can reueale thee


for thoughe she be riche and fayre
yet she is bothe wise and kynde
and therefore do thou not despayre
but thy faythe may fancy fynde
yet allthoughe she be a quene
that maye suche a snake despyse
yet withe sylence all vnseene
runn and hide thee in her eyes
where if she will let thee dye
yet at latest gaspe of breathe
saye that in a ladyes eye
loue both tooke his lyfe and deathe


colin my dear and most entire beloved
my muse audacious stoops her pitch to thee
desiring that thy patience be not moved
by these rude lines written here you see
fain would my muse whom cruel love hath wronged
shroud her love labours under thy protection
and i myself with ardent zeal have longed
that thou mightst know to thee my true affection
therefore good colin graciously accept
a few sad sonnets which my muse hath framed
though they but newly from the shell are crept
suffer them not by envy to be blamed
but underneath the shadow of thy wings
give warmth to these younghatched orphan things


give warmth to these younghatched orphan things
which chill with cold to thee for succour creep
they of my study are the budding springs
longer i cannot them in silence keep
they will be gadding sore against my mind
but courteous shepherd if they run astray
conduct them that they may the pathway find
and teach them how the mean observe they may
thou shalt them ken by their discording notes
their weeds are plain such as poor shepherds wear
unshapen torn and ragged are their coats
yet forth they wandring are devoid of fear
they which have tasted of the muses spring
i hope will smile upon the tunes they sing


you whom the world admires for rarest style
you which have sung the sonnets of true love
upon my maiden verse with favour smile
whose weakpenned muse to fly too soon doth prove
before her feathers have their full perfection
she soars aloft pricked on by blind affection


you whose deep wits ingine and industry
the everlasting palm of praise have won
you paragons of learned poesy
favour these mists which fall before your sun
intentions leading to a more effect
if you them grace but with your mild aspect


and thou the genius of my illtuned note
whose beauty urged hath my rustic vein
through mighty oceans of despair to float
that i in rime thy cruelty complain
vouchsafe to read these lines both harsh and bad
nuntiates of woe with sorrow being clad


courteous calliope vouchsafe to lend
thy helping hand to my untuned song
and grace these lines which i to write pretend
compelled by love which doth poor corin wrong
and those thy sacred sisters i beseech
which on parnassus mount do ever dwell
to shield my country muse and rural speech
by their divine authority and spell
lastly to thee o pan the shepherds king
and you swiftfooted dryades i call
attend to hear a swain in verse to sing
sonnets of her that keeps his heart in thrall
o chloris weigh the task i undertake
thy beauty subject of my song i make


thy beauty subject of my song i make
o fairest fair on whom depends my life
refuse not then the task i undertake
to please thy rage and to appease my strife
but with one smile remunerate my toil
none other guerdon i of thee desire
give not my lowly muse newhatched the foil
but warmth that she may at the length aspire
unto the temples of thy starbright eyes
upon whose round orbs perfect beauty sits
from whence such glorious crystal beams arise
as best my chloris seemly face befits
which eyes which beauty which bright crystal beam
which face of thine hath made my love extreme


feed silly sheep although your keeper pineth
yet like to tantalus doth see his food
skip you and leap no bright apollo shineth
whilst i bewail my sorrows in yon wood
where woeful philomela doth record
and sings with notes of sad and dire lament
the tragedy wrought by her sisters lord
ill bear a part in her black discontent
that pipe which erst was wont to make you glee
upon these downs whereon you careless graze
shall to her mournful music tuned be
let not my plaints poor lambkins you amaze
there underneath that dark and dusky bower
whole showers of tears to chloris i will pour


whole showers of tears to chloris i will pour
as true oblations of my sincere love
if that will not suffice most fairest flower
then shall my sighs thee unto pity move
if neither tears nor sighs can aught prevail
my streaming blood thine anger shall appease
this hand of mine by vigour shall assail
to tear my heart asunder thee to please
celestial powers on you i invocate
you know the chaste affections of my mind
i never did my faith yet violate
why should my chloris then be so unkind
that neither tears nor sighs nor streaming blood
can unto mercy move her cruel mood


you fawns and silvans when my chloris brings
her flocks to water in your pleasant plains
solicit her to pity corins strings
the smart whereof for her he still sustains
for she is ruthless of my woeful song
my oaten reed she not delights to hear
o chloris chloris corin thou dost wrong
who loves thee better than his own heart dear
the flames of aetna are not half so hot
as is the fire which thy disdain hath bread
ah cruel fates why do you then besot
poor corins soul with love when love is fled
either cause cruel chloris to relent
or let me die upon the wound she sent


you lofty pines copartners of my woe
when chloris sitteth underneath your shade
to her those sighs and tears i pray you show
whilst you attending i for her have made
whilst you attending dropped have sweet balm
in token that you pity my distress
zephirus hath your stately boughs made calm
whilst i to you my sorrows did express
the neighbour mountains bended have their tops
when they have heard my rueful melody
and elves in rings about me leaps and hops
to frame my passions to their jollity
resounding echoes from their obscure caves
reiterate what most my fancy craves


what need i mourn seeing pan our sacred king
was of that nymph fair syrinx coy disdained
the worlds great light which comforteth each thing
all comfortless for daphnes sake remained
if gods can find no help to heal the sore
made by loves shafts which pointed are with fire
unhappy corin then thy chance deplore
sith they despair by wanting their desire
i am not pan though i a shepherd be
yet is my love as fair as syrinx was
my songs cannot with phoebus tunes agree
yet chloris doth his daphnes far surpass
how much more fair by so much more unkind
than syrinx coy or daphne i her find


no sooner had fair phoebus trimmed his car
being newly risen from auroras bed
but i in whom despair and hope did war
my unpenned flock unto the mountains led
tripping upon the snowsoft downs i spied
three nymphs more fairer than those beautys three
which did appear to paris on mount ide
coming more near my goddess i there see
for she the fieldnymphs oftentimes doth haunt
to hunt with them the fierce and savage boar
and having sported virelays they chaunt
whilst i unhappy helpless cares deplore
there did i call to her ah too unkind
but tigerlike of me she had no mind


unto the fountain where fair delia chaste
the proud acteon turned to a hart
i drove my flock that water sweet to taste
cause from the welkin phoebus gan depart
there did i see the nymph whom i admire
remembring her locks of which the yellow hue
made blush the beauties of her curled wire
which jove himself with wonder well might view
then red with ire her tresses she berent
and weeping hid the beauty of her face
whilst i amazed at her discontent
with tears and sighs do humbly sue for grace
but she regarding neither tears nor moan
flies from the fountain leaving me alone


am i a gorgon that she doth me fly
or was i hatched in the river nile
or doth my chloris stand in doubt that i
with syren songs do seek her to beguile
if any one of these she can object
gainst me which chaste affected love protest
then might my fortunes by her frowns be checked
and blameless she from scandal free might rest
but seeing i am no hideous monster born
but have that shape which other men do bear
which form great jupiter did never scorn
amongst his subjects here on earth to wear
why should she then that soul with sorrow fill
which vowed hath to love and serve her still


tell me my dear what moves thy ruthless mind
to be so cruel seeing thou art so fair
did nature frame thy beauty so unkind
or dost thou scorn to pity my despair
o no it was not natures ornament
but winged loves unpartial cruel wound
which in my heart is ever permanent
until my chloris make me whole and sound
o glorious lovegod think on my hearts grief
let not thy vassal pine through deep disdain
by wounding chloris i shall find relief
if thou impart to her some of my pain
she doth thy temples and thy shrines abject
they with amintas flowers by me are decked


cease eyes to weep sith none bemoans your weeping
leave off good muse to sound the cruel name
of my loves queen which hath my heart in keeping
yet of my love doth make a jesting game
long hath my sufferance laboured to inforce
one pearl of pity from her pretty eyes
whilst i with restless oceans of remorse
bedew the banks where my fair chloris lies
where my fair chloris bathes her tender skin
and doth triumph to see such rivers fall
from those moist springs which never dry have been
since she their honour hath detained in thrall
and still she scorns one favouring smile to show
unto those waves proceeding from my woe


what time fair titan in the zenith sat
and equally the fixed poles did heat
when to my flock my daily woes i chat
and underneath a broad beech took my seat
the dreaming god which morpheus poets call
augmenting fuel to my aetnas fire
with sleep possessing my weak senses all
in apparitions makes my hopes aspire
methought i saw the nymph i would embrace
with arms abroad coming to me for help
a lustled satyr having her in chase
which after her about the fields did yelp
i seeing my love in perplexed plight
a sturdy bat from off an oak i reft
and with the ravisher continue fight
till breathless i upon the earth him left
then when my coy nymph saw her breathless foe
with kisses kind she gratifies my pain
protesting never rigour more to show
happy was i this good hap to obtain
but drowsy slumbers flying to their cell
my sudden joy converted was to bale
my wonted sorrows still with me do dwell
i looked round about on hill and dale


but i could neither my fair chloris view
nor yet the satyr which erstwhile i slew


mournful amintas thou didst pine with care
because the fates by their untimely doom
of life bereft thy loving phillis fair
when thy loves spring did first begin to bloom
my care doth countervail that care of thine
and yet my chloris draws her angry breath
my hopes still hoping hopeless now repine
for living she doth add to me but death
thy phinis dying loved thee full dear
my chloris living hates poor corins love
thus doth my woe as great as thine appear
though sundry accents both our sorrows move
thy swanlike songs did show thy dying anguish
these weeping trucemen show i living languish


these weeping trucemen show i living languish
my woeful wailings tells my discontent
yet chloris nought esteemeth of mine anguish
my thrilling throbs her heart cannot relent
my kids to hear the rimes and roundelays
which i on wasteful hills was wont to sing
did more delight the lark in summer days
whose echo made the neighbour groves to ring
but now my flock all drooping bleats and cries
because my pipe the author of their sport
all rent and torn and unrespected lies
their lamentations do my cares consort
they cease to feed and listen to the plaint
which i pour forth unto a cruel saint


which i pour forth unto a cruel saint
who merciless my prayers doth attend
who tigerlike doth pity my complaint
and never ear unto my woes will lend
but still false hope dispairing life deludes
and tells my fancy i shall grace obtain
but chloris fair my orisons concludes
with fearful frowns presagers of my pain
thus do i spend the weary wandring day
oppressed with a chaos of hearts grief
thus i consume the obscure night away
neglecting sleep which brings all cares relief
thus do i pass my lingring life in woe
but when my bliss will come i do not know


the perils which leander took in hand
fair heros love and favour to obtain
when void of fear securely leaving land
through hellespont he swam to cestos main
his dangers should not counterpoise my toil
if my dear love would once but pity show
to quench these flames which in my breast do broil
or dry these springs which from mine eyes do flow
not only hellespont but ocean seas
for her sweet sake to ford i would attempt
so that my travels would her ire appease
my soul from thrall and languish to exempt
o what ist not poor i would undertake
if labour could my peace with chloris make


my love i cannot thy rare beauties place
under those forms which many writers use
some like to stones compare their mistress face
some in the name of flowers do love abuse
some makes their love a goldsmiths shop to be
where orient pearls and precious stones abound
in my conceit these far do disagree
the perfect praise of beauty forth to sound
o chloris thou dost imitate thyself
selfs imitating passeth precious stones
or all the eastern indian golden pelf
thy red and white with purest fair atones
matchless for beauty nature hath thee framed
only unkind and cruel thou art named


the hound by eating grass doth find relief
for being sick it is his choicest meat
the wounded hart doth ease his pain and grief
if he the herb dictamion may eat
the loathsome snake renews his sight again
when he casts off his withered coat and hue
the skybred eagle fresh age doth obtain
when he his beak decayed doth renew
i worse than these whose sore no salve can cure
whose grief no herb nor plant nor tree can ease
remediless i still must pain endure
till i my chloris furious mood can please
she like the scorpion gave to me a wound
and like the scorpion she must make me sound


ye wasteful woods bear witness of my woe
wherein my plaints did oftentimes abound
ye careless birds my sorrows well do know
they in your songs were wont to make a sound
thou pleasant spring canst record likewise bear
of my designs and sad disparagement
when thy transparent billows mingled were
with those downfalls which from mine eyes were sent
the echo of my stilllamenting cries
from hollow vaults in treble voice resoundeth
and then into the empty air it flies
and back again from whence it came reboundeth
that nymph unto my clamors doth reply
being likewise scorned in love as well as i


being likewise scorned in love as well as i
by that selfloving boy which did disdain
to hear her after him for love to cry
for which in dens obscure she doth remain
yet doth she answer to each speech and voice
and renders back the last of what we speak
but specially if she might have her choice
she of unkindness would her talk forth break
she loves to hear of loves most sacred name
although poor nymph in love she was despised
and ever since she hides her head for shame
that her true meaning was so lightly prised
she pitying me part of my woes doth bear
as you good shepherds listening now shall hear


o fairest fair to thee i make my plaint
to thee from whom my cause of grief doth spring
attentive be unto the groans sweet saint
which unto thee in doleful tunes i sing
my mournful muse doth always speak of thee
my love is pure o do it not disdain
with bitter sorrow still oppress not me
but mildly look upon me which complain
kill not my trueaffecting thoughts but give
such precious balm of comfort to my heart
that casting off despair in hope to live
i may find help at length to ease my smart
so shall you add such courage to my love
that fortune false my faith shall not remove


the phoenix fair which rich arabia breeds
when wasting time expires her tragedy
no more on phoebus radiant rays she feeds
but heapeth up great store of spicery
and on a lofty towering cedar tree
with heavenly substance she herself consumes
from whence she young again appears to be
out of the cinders of her peerless plumes
so i which long have fried in loves flame
the fire not made of spice but sighs and tears
revive again in hope disdain to shame
and put to flight the author of my fears
her eyes revive decaying life in me
though they augmenters of my thraldom be


though they augmenters of my thraldom be
for her i live and her i love and none else
o then fair eyes look mildly upon me
who poor despised forlorn must live alone else
and like amintas haunt the desert cells
and moanless there breathe out thy cruelty
where none but care and melancholy dwells
i for revenge to nemesis will cry
if that will not prevail my wandering ghost
which breathless here this lovescorched trunk shall leave
shall unto thee with tragic tidings post
how thy disdain did life from soul bereave
then all too late my death thou wilt repent
when murthers guilt thy conscience shall torment


who doth not know that love is triumphant
sitting upon the throne of majesty
the gods themselves his cruel darts do daunt
and he blind boy smiles at their misery
love made great jove ofttimes transform his shape
love made the fierce alcides stoop at last
achilles stout and bold could not escape
the direful doom which love upon him cast
love made leander pass the dreadful flood
which cestos from abydos doth divide
love made a chaos where proud ilion stood
through love the carthaginian dido died
thus may we see how love doth rule and reigns
bringing those under which his power disdains


though you be fair and beautiful withal
and i am black for which you me despise
know that your beauty subject is to fall
though you esteem it at so high a price
and time may come when that whereof you boast
which is your youths chief wealth and ornament
shall withered be by winters raging frost
when beautys pride and flowering years are spent
then wilt thou mourn when none shall thee respect
then wilt thou think how thou hast scorned my tears
then pitiless each one will thee neglect
when hoary grey shall dye thy yellow hairs
then wilt thou think upon poor corins case
who loved thee dear yet lived in thy disgrace


o love leave off with sorrow to torment me
let my hearts grief and pining pain content thee
the breach is made i give thee leave to enter
thee to resist great god i dare not venter
restless desire doth aggravate mine anguish
careful conceits do fill my soul with languish
be not too cruel in thy conquest gained
thy deadly shafts hath victory obtained
batter no more my fort with fierce affection
but shield me captive under thy protection
i yield to thee o love thou art the stronger
raise then thy siege and trouble me no longer


what cruel star or fate had domination
when i was born that thus my love is crossed
or from what planet had i derivation
that thus my life in seas of woe is crossed
doth any live that ever had such hap
that all their actions are of none effect
whom fortune never dandled in her lap
but as an abject still doth me reject
ah tickle dame and yet thou constant art
my daily grief and anguish to increase
and to augment the troubles of my heart
thou of these bonds wilt never me release
so that thy darlings me to be may know
the true idea of all worldly woe


some in their hearts their mistress colours bears
some hath her gloves some other hath her garters
some in a bracelet wears her golden hairs
and some with kisses seal their loving charters
but i which never favour reaped yet
nor had one pleasant look from her fair brow
content myself in silent shade to sit
in hope at length my cares to overplow
meanwhile mine eyes shall feed on her fair face
my sighs shall tell to her my sad designs
my painful pen shall ever sue for grace
to help my heart which languishing now pines
and i will triumph still amidst my woe
till mercy shall my sorrows overflow


the raging sea within his limits lies
and with an ebb his flowing doth discharge
the rivers when beyond their bounds they rise
themselves do empty in the ocean large
but my loves sea which never limit keepeth
which never ebbs but always ever floweth
in liquid salt unto my chloris weepeth
yet frustrate are the tears which he bestoweth
this sea which first was but a little spring
is now so great and far beyond all reason
that it a deluge to my thoughts doth bring
which overwhelmed hath my joying season
so hard and dry is my saints cruel mind
these waves no way in her to sink can find


these waves no way in her to sink can find
to penetrate the pith of contemplation
these tears cannot dissolve her hardened mind
nor move her heart on me to take compassion
o then poor corin scorned and quite despised
loathe now to live since life procures thy woe
enough thou hast thy heart anatomised
for her sweet sake which will no pity show
but as cold winters storms and nipping frost
can never change sweet aramanthus hue
so though my love and life by her are crossed
my heart shall still be constant firm and true
although erynnis hinders hymens rites
my fixed faith against oblivion fights


my fixed faith against oblivion fights
and i cannot forget her pretty elf
although she cruel be unto my plights
yet let me rather clean forget myself
then her sweet name out of my mind should go
which is th elixir of my pining soul
from whence the essence of my life doth flow
whose beauty rare my senses all control
themselves most happy evermore accounting
that such a nymph is queen of their affection
with ravished rage they to the skies are mounting
esteeming not their thraldom nor subjection
but still do joy amidst their misery
with patience bearing loves captivity


with patience bearing loves captivity
themselves unguilty of his wrath alleging
these homely lines abjects of poesy
for liberty and for their ransom pledging
and being free they solemnly do vow
under his banner ever arms to bear
against those rebels which do disallow
that love of bliss should be the sovereign heir
and chloris if these weeping trucemen may
one spark of pity from thine eyes obtain
in recompense of their sad heavy lay
poor corin shall thy faithful friend remain
and what i say i ever will approve
no joy may be compared to thy love


the bird of thrace which doth bewail her rape
and murthered itys eaten by his sire
when she her woes in doleful tunes doth shape
she sets her breast against a thorny briar
because carecharmer sleep should not disturb
the tragic tale which to the night she tells
she doth her rest and quietness thus curb
amongst the groves where secret silence dwells
even so i wake and waking wail all night
chloris unkindness slumbers doth expel
i need not thorns sweet sleep to put to flight
her cruelty my golden rest doth quell
that day and night to me are always one
consumed in woe in tears in sighs and moan


like to the shipman in his brittle boat
tossed aloft by the unconstant wind
by dangerous rocks and whirling gulfs doth float
hoping at length the wished port to find
so doth my love in stormy billows sail
and passeth the gaping scillas waves
in hope at length with chloris to prevail
and win that prize which most my fancy craves
which unto me of value will be more
then was that rich and wealthy golden fleece
which jason stout from colchos island bore
with wind in sails unto the shore of greece
more rich more rare more worth her love i prize
then all the wealth which under heaven lies


o what a wound and what a deadly stroke
doth cupid give to us perplexed lovers
which cleaves more fast then ivy doth to oak
unto our hearts where he his might discovers
though warlike mars were armed at all points
with that tried coat which fiery vulcan made
loves shafts did penetrate his steeled joints
and in his breast in streaming gore did wade
so pitiless is this fell conqueror
that in his mothers paps his arrows stuck
such is his rage that he doth not defer
to wound those orbs from whence he life did suck
then sith no mercy he shows to his mother
we meekly must his force and rigour smother


each beast in field doth wish the morning light
the birds to hesper pleasant lays do sing
the wanton kids wellfed rejoice in night
being likewise glad when day begins to spring
but night nor day are welcome unto me
both can bear witness of my lamentation
all day sad sighing corin you shall see
all night he spends in tears and exclamation
thus still i live although i take no rest
but living look as one that is adying
thus my sad soul with care and grief oppressed
seems as a ghost to styx and lethe flying
thus hath fond love bereft my youthful years
of all good hap before old age appears


that day wherein mine eyes cannot her see
which is the essence of their crystal sight
both blind obscure and dim that day they be
and are debarred of fair heavens light
that day wherein mine ears do want to hear her
hearing that day is from me quite bereft
that day wherein to touch i come not near her
that day no sense of touching i have left
that day wherein i lack the fragrant smell
which from her pleasant amber breath proceedeth
smelling that day disdains with me to dwell
only weak hope my pining carcase feedeth
but burst poor heart thou hast no better hope
since all thy senses have no further scope


the stately lion and the furious bear
the skill of man doth alter from their kind
for where before they wild and savage were
by art both tame and meek you shall them find
the elephant although a mighty beast
a man may rule according to his skill
the lusty horse obeyeth our behest
for with the curb you may him guide at will
although the flint most hard contains the fire
by force we do his virtue soon obtain
for with a steel you shall have your desire
thus man may all things by industry gain
only a woman if she list not love
no art nor force can unto pity move


no art nor force can unto pity move
her stony heart that makes my heart to pant
no pleading passions of my extreme love
can mollify her mind of adamant
ah cruel sex and foe to all mankind
either you love or else you hate too much
a glistring show of gold in you we find
and yet you prove but copper in the touch
but why o why do i so far digress
nature you made of pure and fairest mould
the pomp and glory of man to depress
and as your slaves in thraldom them to hold
which by experience now too well i prove
there is no pain unto the pains of love


fair shepherdess when as these rustic lines
comes to thy sight weigh but with what affection
thy servile doth depaint his sad designs
which to redress of thee he makes election
if so you scorn you kill if you seem coy
you wound poor corin to the very heart
if that you smile you shall increase his joy
if these you like you banish do all smart
and this i do protest most fairest fair
my muse shall never cease that hill to climb
to which the learned muses do repair
and all to deify thy name in rime
and never none shall write with truer mind
as by all proof and trial you shall find


die die my hopes for you do but augment
the burning accents of my deep despair
disdain and scorn your downfall do consent
tell to the world she is unkind yet fair
o eyes close up those everrunning fountains
for pitiless are all the tears you shed
wherewith you watered have both dales and mountains
i see i see remorse from her is fled
pack hence ye sighs into the empty air
into the air that none your sound may hear
sith cruel chloris hath of you no care
although she once esteemed you full dear
let sable night all your disgraces cover
yet truer sighs were never sighed by lover


thou glorious sun from whence my lesser light
the substance of his crystal shine doth borrow
let these my moans find favour in thy sight
and with remorse extinguish now my sorrow
renew those lamps which thy disdain hath quenched
as phoebus doth his sister phoebes shine
consider how thy corin being drenched
in seas of woe to thee his plaints incline
and at thy feet with tears doth sue for grace
which art the goddess of his chaste desire
let not thy frowns these labours poor deface
although aloft they at the first aspire
and time shall come as yet unknown to men
when i more large thy praises forth shall pen


when i more large thy praises forth shall show
that all the world thy beauty shall admire
desiring that most sacred nymph to know
which hath the shepherds fancy set on fire
till then my dear let these thine eyes content
till then fair love think if i merit favour
till then o let thy merciful assent
relish my hopes with some comforting savour
so shall you add such courage to my muse
that she shall climb the steep parnassus hill
that learned poets shall my deeds peruse
when i from thence obtained have more skill
and what i sing shall always be of thee
as long as life or breath remains in me


when she was born whom i entirely love
th immortal gods her birthrites forth to grace
descending from their glorious seat above
they did on her these several virtues place
first saturn gave to her sobriety
jove then indued her with comeliness
and sol with wisdom did her beautify
mercury with wit and knowledge did her bless
venus with beauty did all parts bedeck
luna therewith did modesty combine
diana chaste all loose desires did check
and like a lamp in clearness she doth shine
but mars according to his stubborn kind
no virtue gave but a disdainful mind


when chloris first with her heartrobbing eye
inchanted had my silly senses all
i little did respect loves cruelty
i never thought his snares should me enthrall
but since her tresses have entangled me
my pining flock did never hear me sing
those jolly notes which erst did make them glee
nor do my kids about me leap and spring
as they were wont but when they hear me cry
they likewise cry and fill the air with bleating
then do my sheep upon the cold earth lie
and feed no more my griefs they are repeating
o chloris if thou then sawst them and me
im sure thou wouldst both pity them and me


i need not tell thee of the lily white
nor of the roseate red which doth thee grace
nor of thy golden hairs like phoebus bright
nor of the beauty of thy fairest face
nor of thine eyes which heavenly stars excel
nor of thine azured veins which are so clear
nor of thy paps where love himself doth dwell
which like two hills of violets appear
nor of thy tender sides nor belly soft
nor of thy goodly thighs as white as snow
whose glory to my fancy seemeth oft
that like an arch triumphal they do show
all these i know that thou dost know too well
but of thy heart too cruel i thee tell


but of thy heart too cruel i thee tell
which hath tormented my young budding age
and doth unless your mildness passions quell
my utter ruin near at hand presage
instead of blood which wont was to display
his ruddy red upon my hairless face
by overgrieving that is fled away
pale dying colour there hath taken place
those curled locks which thou wast wont to twist
unkempt unshorn and out of order been
since my disgrace i had of them no list
since when these eyes no joyful day have seen
nor never shall till you renew again
the mutual love which did possess us twain


you that embrace enchanting poesy
be gracious to perplexed corins lines
you that do feel loves proud authority
help me to sing my sighs and sad designs
chloris requite not faithful love with scorn
but as thou oughtest have commiseration
i have enough anatomised and torn
my heart thereof to make a pure oblation
likewise consider how thy corin prizeth
thy parts above each absolute perfection
how he of every precious thing deviseth
to make thee sovereign grant me then affection
else thus i prize thee chloris is alone
more hard than gold or pearl or precious stone


it chaunced me on day beside the shore
of siluer streaming thamesis to bee
nigh where the goodly verlame stood of yore
of which there now remaines no memorie
nor anie little moniment to see
by which the trauailer that fares that way
this once was she may warned be to say


there on the other side i did behold
a woman sitting sorrowfullie wailing
rending her yeolow locks like wyrie golde
about her shoulders careleslie downe trailing
and streames of teares from her faire eyes forth railing
in her right hand a broken rod she held
which towards heauen shee seemd on high to weld


whether she were one of that riuers nymphes
which did the losse of some dere loue lament
i doubt or one of those three fatall impes
which draw the dayes of men forth in extent
or thauncient genius of that citie brent
but seeing her so piteouslie perplexed
i to her calling askt what her so vexed


ah what delight quoth she in earthlie thing
or comfort can i wretched creature haue
whose happines the heauens enuying
from highest staire to lowest step me draue
and haue in mine owne bowels made my graue
that of all nations now i am forlorne
the worlds sad spectacle and fortunes scorne


much was i mooued at her piteous plaint
and felt my heart nigh riuen in my brest
with tender ruth to see her sore constraint
that shedding teares a while i still did rest
and after did her name of her request
name haue i none quoth she nor anie being
bereft of both by fates vniust decreeing


i was that citie which the garland wore
of britaines pride deliuered vnto me
by romane victors which it wonne of yore
though nought at all but ruines now i bee
and lye in mine owne ashes as ye see
verlame i was what bootes it that i was
sith now i am but weedes and wastfull gras


o vaine worlds glorie and vnstedfast state
of all that liues on face of sinfull earth
which from their first vntill their vtmost date
tast no one hower of happines or merth
but like as at the ingate of their berth
they crying creep out of their mothers woomb
so wailing backe go to their wofull toomb


why then dooth flesh a bubble glas of breath
hunt after honour and aduauncement vaine
and reare a trophee for deuouring death
with so great labour and long lasting paine
as if his daies for euer should remaine
sith all that in this world is great or gaie
doth as a vapour vanish and decaie


looke backe who list vnto the former ages
and call to count what is of them become
where be those learned wits and antique sages
which of all wisedome knew the perfect somme
where those great warriors which did ouercomme
the world with conquest of their might and maine
and made one meare of thearth and of their raine


what nowe is of thassyrian lyonesse
of whome no footing now on earth appeares
what of the persian beares outragiousnesse
whose memorie is quite worne out with yeares
who of the grecian libbard now ought heares
that ouerran the east with greedie powre
and left his whelps their kingdomes to deuoure


and where is that same great seuen headded beast
that made all nations vassals of her pride
to fall before her feete at her beheast
and in the necke of all the world did ride
where doth she all that wondrous welth nowe hide
with her own weight down pressed now shee lies
and by her heaps her hugenesse testifies


o rome thy ruine i lament and rue
and in thy fall my fatall ouerthrowe
that whilom was whilst heauens with equall vewe
deignd to behold me and their gifts bestowe
the picture of thy pride in pompous shew
and of the whole world as thou wast the empresse
so i of this small northerne world was princesse


to tell the beawtie of my buildings fayre
adornd with purest golde and precious stone
to tell my riches and endowments rare
that by my foes are now all spent and gone
to tell my forces matchable to none
were but lost labour that few would beleeue
and with rehearsing would me more agreeue


high towers faire temples goodly theaters
strong walls rich porches princelie pallaces
large streetes braue houses sacred sepulchers
sure gates sweete gardens stately galleries
wrought with faire pillours and fine imageries
all those o pitie now are turnd to dust
and ouergrowen with blacke obliuions rust


theretoo for warlike power and peoples store
in britannie was none to match with mee
that manie often did abie full sore
ne troynouant though elder sister shee
with my great forces might compared bee
that stout pendragon to his perill felt
who in a siege seauen yeres about me dwelt


but long ere this bunduca britonnesse
her mightie hoast against my bulwarkes brought
bunduca that victorious conqueresse
that lifting vp her braue heroøck thought
boue womens weaknes with the romanes fought
fought and in field against them thrice preuailed
yet was she foyld when as she me assailed


and though at last by force i conquered were
of hardie saxons and became their thrall
yet was i with much bloodshed bought full deere
and prizde with slaughter of their generall
the moniment of whose sad funerall
for wonder of the world long in me lasted
but now to nought through spoyle of time is wasted


wasted it is as if it neuer were
and all the rest that me so honord made
and of the world admired eurie where
is turnd to smoake that doth to nothing fade
and of that brightnes now appeares no shade
but greislie shades such as doo haunt in hell
with fearfull fiends that in deep darknes dwell


where my high steeples whilom vsde to stand
on which the lordly faulcon wont to towre
there now is but an heap of lyme and sand
for the shricheowle to build her balefull bowre
and where the nightingale wont forth to powre
her restles plaints to comfort wakefull louers
there now haunt yelling mewes and whining plouers


and where the christall thamis wont to slide
in siluer channell downe along the lee
about whose flowrie bankes on either side
a thousand nymphes with mirthfull iollitee
were wont to play from all annoyance free
there now no riuers course is to be seene
but moorish fennes and marshes euer greene


seemes that that gentle riuer for great griefe
of my mishaps which oft i to him plained
or for to shunne the horrible mischiefe
with which he saw my cruell foes me pained
and his pure streames with guiltles blood oft stained
from my vnhappie neighborhood farre fled
and his sweete waters away with him led


there also where the winged ships were seene
in liquid waues to cut their fomie waie
and thousand fishers numbred to haue been
in that wide lake looking for plenteous praie
of fish which they with baits vsde to betraie
is now no lake nor anie fishers store
nor euer ship shall saile there anie more


they all are gone and all with them is gone
ne ought to me remaines but to lament
my long decay which no man els doth mone
and mourne my fall with dolefull dreriment
yet it is comfort in great languishment
to be bemoned with compassion kinde
and mitigates the anguish of the minde


but me no man bewaileth but in game
ne sheddeth teares from lamentable eie
nor anie liues that mentioneth my name
to be remembred of posteritie
saue one that maugre fortunes iniurie
and times decay and enuies cruell tort
hath writ my record in trueseeming sort


cambden the nourice of antiquitie
and lanterne vnto late succeeding age
to see the light of simple veritie
buried in ruines through the great outrage
of her owne people led with warlike rage
cambden though time all moniments obscure
yet thy iust labours euer shall endure


but whie vnhappie wight doo i thus crie
and grieue that my remembrance quite is raced
out of the knowledge of posteritie
and all my antique moniments defaced
sith i doo dailie see things highest placed
so soone as fates their vitall thred haue shorne
forgotten quite as they were neuer borne


it is not long since these two eyes beheld
a mightie prince of most renowmed race
whom england high in count of honour held
and greatest ones did sue to gaine his grace
of greatest ones he greatest in his place
sate in the bosome of his soueraine
and right and loyall did his word maintaine


i saw him die i saw him die as one
of the meane people and brought foorth on beare
i saw him die and no man left to mone
his dolefull fate that late him loued deare
scarse anie left to close his eylids neare
scarse anie left vpon his lips to laie
the sacred sod or requiem to saie


o trustlesse state of miserable men
that builde your blis on hope of earthly thing
and vainly thinke your selues halfe happie then
when painted faces with smooth flattering
doo fawne on you and your wide praises sing
and when the courting masker louteth lowe
him true in heart and trustie to you trow


all is but fained and with oaker dide
that euerie shower will wash and wipe away
all things doo change that vnder heauen abide
and after death all friendship doth decaie
therefore what euer man bearst worldlie sway
liuing on god and on thy selfe relie
for when thou diest all shall with thee die


he now is dead and all is with him dead
saue what in heauens storehouse he vplaid
his hope is faild and come to passe his dread
and euill men now dead his deeds vpbraid
spite bites the dead that liuing neuer baid
he now is gone the whiles the foxe is crept
into the hole the which the badger swept


he now is dead and all his glorie gone
and all his greatnes vapoured to nought
that as a glasse vpon the water shone
which vanisht quite so soone as it was sought
his name is worne alreadie out of thought
ne anie poet seekes him to reuiue
yet manie poets honourd him aliue


ne doth his colin carelesse colin cloute
care now his idle bagpipe vp to raise
ne tell his sorrow to the listning rout
of shepherd groomes which wont his songs to praise
praise who so list yet i will him dispraise
vntill he quite him of this guiltie blame
wake shepheards boy at length awake for shame


and who so els did goodnes by him gaine
and who so els his bounteous minde did trie
whether he shepheard be or shepheards swaine
for manie did which doo it now denie
awake and to his song a part applie
and i the whilest you mourne for his decease
will with my mourning plaints your plaint increase


he dyde and after him his brother dyde
his brother prince his brother noble peere
that whilste he liued was of none enuyde
and dead is now as liuing counted deare
deare vnto all that true affection beare
but vnto thee most deare o dearest dame
his noble spouse and paragon of fame


he whilest he liued happie was through thee
and being dead is happie now much more
liuing that lincked chaunst with thee to bee
and dead because him dead thou dost adore
as liuing and thy lost deare loue deplore
so whilst that thou faire flower of chastitie
dost liue by thee thy lord shall neuer die


thy lord shall neuer die the whiles this verse
shall liue and surely it shall liue for euer
for euer it shall liue and shall rehearse
his worthie praise and vertues dying neuer
though death his soule doo from his bodie seuer
and thou thy selfe herein shalt also liue
such grace the heauens doo to my verses giue


ne shall his sister ne thy father die
thy father that good earle of rare renowne
and noble patrone of weake pouertie
whose great good deeds in countrey and in towne
haue purchast him in heauen an happie crowne
where he now liueth in eternall blis
and left his sonne tensue those steps of his


he noble bud his grandsires liuelie hayre
vnder the shadow of thy countenaunce
now ginnes to shoote vp fast and flourish fayre
in learned artes and goodlie gouernaunce
that him to highest honour shall aduaunce
braue impe of bedford grow apace in bountie
and count of wisedome more than of thy countie


ne may i let thy husbands sister die
that goodly ladie sith she eke did spring
out of this stocke and famous familie
whose praises i to future age doo sing
and foorth out of her happie womb did bring
the sacred brood of learning and all honour
in whom the heauens powrde all their gifts vpon her


most gentle spirite breathed from aboue
out of the bosome of the makers blis
in whom all bountie and all vertuous loue
appeared in their natiue propertis
and did enrich that noble breast of his
with treasure passing all this worldes worth
worthie of heauen it selfe which brought it forth


his blessed spirite full of power diuine
and influence of all celestiall grace
loathing this sinfull earth and earthlie slime
fled backe too soone vnto his natiue place
too soone for all that did his loue embrace
too soone for all this wretched world whom he
robd of all right and true nobilitie


yet ere his happie soule to heauen went
out of this fleshlie goale he did deuise
vnto his heauenlie maker to present
his bodie as a spotles sacrifise
and chose that guiltie hands of enemies
should powre forth thoffring of his guiltles blood
so life exchanging for his countries good


o noble spirite liue there euer blessed
the worlds late wonder and the heauens new ioy
liue euer there and leaue me here distressed
with mortall cares and cumbrous worlds anoy
but where thou dost that happines enioy
bid me o bid me quicklie come to thee
that happie there i maie thee alwaies see


yet whilest the fates affoord me vitall breath
i will it spend in speaking of thy praise
and sing to thee vntill that timelie death
by heauens doome doo ende my earthlie daies
thereto doo thou my humble spirite raise
and into me that sacred breath inspire
which thou there breathest perfect and entire


then will i sing but who can better sing
than thine owne sister peerles ladie bright
which to thee sings with deep harts sorrowing
sorrowing tempered with deare delight
that her to heare i feele my feeble spright
robbed of sense and rauished with ioy
o sad ioy made of mourning and anoy


yet will i sing but who can better sing
than thou thy selfe thine owne selfes valiance
that whilest thou liuedst madest the forrests ring
and fields resownd and flockes to leap and daunce
and shepheards leaue their lambs vnto mischaunce
to runne thy shrill arcadian pipe to heare
o happie were those dayes thrice happie were


but now more happie thou and wretched wee
which want the wonted sweetnes of thy voice
whiles thou now in elisian fields so free
with orpheus and with linus and the choice
of all that euer did in rimes reioyce
conuersest and doost heare their heauenlie layes
and they heare thine and thine doo better praise


so there thou liuest singing euermore
and here thou liuest being euer song
of vs which liuing loued thee afore
and now thee worship mongst that blessed throng
of heauenlie poets and heroes strong
so thou both here and there immortall art
and euerie where through excellent desart


but such as neither of themselues can sing
nor yet are sung of others for reward
die in obscure obliuion as the thing
which neuer was ne euer with regard
their names shall of the later age be heard
but shall in rustie darknes euer lie
vnles they mentiond be with infamie


what booteth it to haue been rich aliue
what to be great what to be gracious
when after death no token doth suruiue
of former being in this mortall hous
but sleepes in dust dead and inglorious
like beast whose breath but in his nostrels is
and hath no hope of happinesse or blis


how manie great ones may remembred be
which in their daies most famouslie did florish
of whome no word we heare nor signe now see
but as things wipt out with a sponge do perishe
because they liuing cared not to cherishe
no gentle wits through pride or couetize
which might their names for euer memorize


prouide therefore ye princes whilst ye liue
that of the muses ye may friended bee
which vnto men eternitie do giue
for they be daughters of dame memorie
and ioue the father of eternitie
and do those men in golden thrones repose
whose merits they to glorifie do chose


the seuen fold yron gates of grislie hell
and horrid house of sad proserpina
they able are with power of mightie spell
to breake and thence the soules to bring awaie
out of dread darkenesse to eternall day
and them immortall make which els would die
in foule forgetfulnesse and nameles lie


so whilome raised they the puissant brood
of golden girt alcmena for great merite
out of the dust to which the oetaean wood
had him consumd and spent his vitall spirite
to highest heauen where now he doth inherite
all happinesse in hebes siluer bowre
chosen to be her dearest paramoure


so raisde they eke faire ledaes warlick twinnes
and interchanged life vnto them lent
that when thone dies thother then beginnes
to shew in heauen his brightnes orient
and they for pittie of the sad wayment
which orpheus for eurydice did make
her back againe to life sent for his sake


so happie are they and so fortunate
whom the pierian sacred sisters loue
that freed from bands of impacable fate
and power of death they liue for aye aboue
where mortall wreakes their blis may not remoue
but with the gods for former vertues meede
on nectar and ambrosia do feede


for deeds doe die how euer noblie donne
and thoughts of men do as themselues decay
but wise wordes taught in numbers for to runne
recorded by the muses liue for ay
ne may with storming showers be washt away
ne bitter breathing windes with harmfull blast
nor age nor enuie shall them euer wast


in vaine doo earthly princes then in vaine
seeke with pyramides to heauen aspired
or huge colosses built with costlie paine
or brasen pillours neuer to be fired
or shrines made of the mettall most desired
to make their memories for euer liue
for how can mortall immortalitie giue


such one mausolus made the worlds great wonder
but now no remnant doth thereof remaine
such one marcellus but was torne with thunder
such one lisippus but is worne with raine
such one king edmond but was rent for gaine
all such vaine moniments of earthlie masse
deuourd of time in time to nought doo passe


but fame with golden wings aloft doth flie
aboue the reach of ruinous decay
and with braue plumes doth beate the azure skie
admird of baseborne men from farre away
then who so will with vertuous deeds assay
to mount to heauen on pegasus must ride
and with sweete poets verse be glorifide


for not to haue been dipt in lethe lake
could saue the sonne of thetis from to die
but that blinde bard did him immortall make
with verses dipt in deaw of castalie
which made the easterne conquerour to crie
o fortunate yongman whose vertue found
so braue a trompe thy noble acts to sound


therefore in this halfe happie i doo read
good melibae that hath a poet got
to sing his liuing praises being dead
deseruing neuer here to be forgot
in spight of enuie that his deeds would spot
since whose decease learning lies vnregarded
and men of armes doo wander vnrewarded


those two be those two great calamities
that long agoe did grieue the noble spright
of salomon with great indignities
who whilome was aliue the wisest wight
but now his wisedome is disprooued quite
for he that now welds all things at his will
scorns thone and thother in his deeper skill


o griefe of griefes o gall of all good heartes
to see that vertue should dispised bee
of him that first was raisde for vertuous parts
and now broad spreading like an aged tree
lets none shoot vp that nigh him planted bee
o let the man of whom the muse is scorned
nor aliue nor dead be of the muse adorned


o vile worlds trust that with such vaine illusion
hath so wise men bewitcht and ouerkest
that they see not the way of their confusion
o vainesse to be added to the rest
that do my soule with inward griefe infest
let them behold the piteous fall of mee
and in my case their owne ensample see


and who so els that sits in highest seate
of this worlds glorie worshipped of all
ne feareth change of time nor fortunes threate
let him behold the horror of my fall
and his owne end vnto remembrance call
that of like ruine he may warned bee
and in himselfe be mooud to pittie mee


thus hauing ended all her piteous plaint
with dolefull shrikes shee vanished away
that i through inward sorrowe wexen faint
and all astonished with deepe dismay
for her departure had no word to say
but sate long time in sencelesse sad affright
looking still if i might of her haue sight


which when i missed hauing looked long
my thought returned greeued home againe
renewing her complaint with passion strong
for ruth of that same womans piteous paine
whose wordes recording in my troubled braine
i felt such anguish wound my feeble heart
that frosen horror ran through euerie part


so inlie greeuing in my groning brest
and deepelie muzing at her doubtfull speach
whose meaning much i labored foorth to wreste
being aboue my slender reasons reach
at length by demonstration me to teach
before mine eies strange sights presented were
like tragicke pageants seeming to appeare


i saw an image all of massie gold
placed on high vpon an altare faire
that all which did the same from farre beholde
might worship it and fall on lowest staire
not that great idoll might with this compaire
to which thassyrian tyrant would haue made
the holie brethren falslie to haue praid


but thaltare on the which this image staid
was o great pitie built of brickle clay
that shortly the foundation decaid
with showres of heauen and tempests worne away
then downe it fell and low in ashes lay
scorned of euerie one which by it went
that i it seing dearelie did lament


next vnto this a statelie towre appeared
built all of richest stone that might bee found
and nigh vnto the heauens in height vpreared
but placed on a plot of sandie ground
not that great towre which is so much renownd
for tongues confusion in holie writ
king ninus worke might be compard to it


but o vaine labours of terrestriall wit
that buildes so stronglie on so frayle a soyle
as with each storme does fall away and flit
and giues the fruit of all your trauailes toyle
to be the pray of tyme and fortunes spoyle
i saw this towre fall sodainlie to dust
that nigh with griefe thereof my heart was brust


then did i see a pleasant paradize
full of sweete flowres and daintiest delights
such as on earth man could not more deuize
with pleasures choyce to feed his cheerefull sprights
not that which merlin by his magicke slights
made for the gentle squire to entertaine
his fayre belphìbe could this gardine staine


but o short pleasure bought with lasting paine
why will hereafter anie flesh delight
in earthlie blis and ioy in pleasures vaine
since that i sawe this gardine wasted quite
that where it was scarce seemed anie sight
that i which once that beautie did beholde
could not from teares my melting eyes withholde


soone after this a giaunt came in place
of wondrous power and of exceeding stature
that none durst vewe the horror of his face
yet was he milde of speach and meeke of nature
not he which in despight of his creatour
with railing tearmes defied the iewish hoast
might with this mightie one in hugenes boast


for from the one he could to thother coast
stretch his strong thighes and thocean ouerstride
and reatch his hand into his enemies hoast
but see the end of pompe and fleshlie pride
one of his feete vnwares from him did slide
that downe hee fell into the deepe abisse
where drownd with him is all his earthlie blisse


then did i see a bridge made all of golde
ouer the sea from one to other side
withouten prop or pillour it tvpholde
but like the coulored rainbowe arched wide
not that great arche which traian edifide
to be a wonder to all age ensuing
was matchable to this in equall vewing


but ah what bootes it to see earthlie thing
in glorie or in greatnes to excell
sith time doth greatest things to ruine bring
this goodlie bridge one foote not fastned well
gan faile and all the rest downe shortlie fell
ne of so braue a building ought remained
that griefe thereof my spirite greatly pained


i saw two beares as white as anie milke
lying together in a mightie caue
of milde aspect and haire as soft as silke
that saluage nature seemed not to haue
nor after greedie spoyle of blood to craue
two fairer beasts might not elswhere be found
although the compast world were sought around


but what can long abide aboue this ground
in state of blis or stedfast happinesse
the caue in which these beares lay sleeping sound
was but earth and with her owne weightinesse
vpon them fell and did vnwares oppresse
that for great sorrow of their sudden fate
henceforth all worlds felicitie i hate


much was i troubled in my heauie spright
at sight of these sad spectacles forepast
that all my senses were bereaued quight
and i in minde remained sore agast
distraught twixt feare and pitie when at last
i heard a voyce which loudly to me called
that with the suddein shrill i was appalled


behold said it and by ensample see
that all is vanitie and griefe of minde
ne other comfort in this world can be
but hope of heauen and heart to god inclinde
for all the rest must needs be left behinde
with that it bad me to the other side
to cast mine eye where other sights i spide


vpon that famous riuers further shore
there stood a snowie swan of heauenly hiew
and gentle kinde as euer fowle afore
a fairer one in all the goodlie criew
of white strimonian brood might no man view
there he most sweetly sung the prophecie
of his owne death in dolefull elegie


at last when all his mourning melodie
he ended had that both the shores resounded
feeling the fit that him forewarnd to die
with loftie flight aboue the earth he bounded
and out of sight to highest heauen mounted
where now he is become an heauenly signe
there now the ioy is his here sorrow mine


whilest thus i looked loe adowne the lee
i sawe an harpe stroong all with siluer twyne
and made of golde and costlie yuorie
swimming that whilome seemed to haue been
the harpe on which dan orpheus was seene
wylde beasts and forrests after him to lead
but was thharpe of philisides now dead


at length out of the riuer is was reard
and borne aboue the cloudes to be diuind
whilst all the way most heauenly noyse was heard
of the strings stirred with the warbling wind
that wrought both ioy and sorrow in my mind
so now in heauen a signe it doth appeare
the harpe well knowne beside the northern beare


soone after this i saw on thother side
a curious coffer made of heben wood
that in it did most precious treasure hide
exceeding all this baser worldes good
yet through the ouerflowing of the flood
it almost drowned was and done to nought
that sight thereof much grieud my pensiue thought


at length when most in perill it was brought
two angels downe descending with swift flight
out of the swelling streame it lightly caught
and twixt their blessed armes it carried quight
aboue the reach of anie liuing sight
so now it is transformd into that starre
in which all heauenly treasures locked are


looking aside i saw a stately bed
adorned all with costly cloth of gold
that might for anie princes couche be red
and deckt with daintie flowres as if it shold
be for some bride her ioyous night to hold
therein a goodly virgine sleeping lay
a fairer wight saw neuer summers day


i heard a voyce that called farre away
and her awaking bad her quickly dight
for lo her bridegrome was in readie ray
to come to her and seeke her loues delight
with that she started vp with cherefull sight
when suddeinly both bed and all was gone
and i in languor left there all alone


still as i gazed i beheld where stood
a knight all armd vpon a winged steed
the same that was bred of medusaes blood
on which dan perseus borne of heauenly seed
the fair andromeda from perill freed
full mortally this knight ywounded was
that streames of blood foorth flowed on the gras


yet was he deckt small ioy to him alas
with manie garlands for his victories
and with rich spoyles which late he did purchas
through braue atcheiuements from his enemies
fainting at last through long infirmities
he smote his steed that straight to heauen him bore
and left me here his losse for to deplore


lastly i saw an arke of purest golde
vpon a brazen pillour standing hie
which thashes seemd of some great prince to hold
enclosde therein for endles memorie
of him whom all the world did glorifie
seemed the heauens with the earth did disagree
whether should of those ashes keeper bee


at last me seemd wing footed mercurie
from heauen descending to appease their strife
the arke did beare with him aboue the skie
and to those ashes gaue a second life
to liue in heauen where happines is rife
at which the earth did grieue exceedingly
and i for dole was almost like to die


immortall spirite of philisides
which now art made the heauens ornament
that whilome wast the worlds chiefst riches
giue leaue to him that loude thee to lament
his losse by lacke of thee to heauen hent
and with last duties of this broken verse
broken with sighes to decke thy sable herse


and ye faire ladie thhonor of your daies
and glorie of the world your high thoughts scorne
vouchsafe this moniment of his last praise
with some few siluer dropping teares tadorne
and as ye be of heauenlie offspring borne
so vnto heauen let your high minde aspire
and loath this drosse of sinfull worlds desire


the patron of true holinesse
foule errour doth defeate
hypocrisie him to entrappe
doth to his home entreate


lo i the man whose muse whilome did maske
as time her taught in lowly shepheards weeds
am now enforst a far vnfitter taske
for trumpets sterne to chaunge mine oaten reeds
and sing of knights and ladies gentle deeds
whose prayses hauing slept in silence long
me all too meane the sacred muse areeds
to blazon broad emongst her learned throng
fierce warres and faithfull loues shall moralize my song


helpe then o holy virgin chiefe of nine
thy weaker nouice to performe thy will
lay forth out of thine euerlasting scryne
the antique rolles which there lye hidden still
of faerie knights and fairest tanaquill
whom that most noble briton prince so long
sought through the world and suffered so much ill
that i must rue his vndeserued wrong
o helpe thou my weake wit and sharpen my dull tong


and thou most dreaded impe of highest ioue
faire venus sonne that with thy cruell dart
at that good knight so cunningly didst roue
that glorious fire it kindled in his hart
lay now thy deadly heben bow apart
and with thy mother milde come to mine ayde
come both and with you bring triumphant mart
in loues and gentle iollities arrayd
after his murdrous spoiles and bloudy rage allayd


and with them eke o goddesse heauenly bright
mirrour of grace and maiestie diuine
great lady of the greatest isle whose light
like phìbus lampe throughout the world doth shine
shed thy faire beames into my feeble eyne
and raise my thoughts too humble and too vile
to thinke of that true glorious type of thine
the argument of mine afflicted stile
the which to heare vouchsafe o dearest dred awhile


a gentle knight was pricking on the plaine
y cladd in mightie armes and siluer shielde
wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine
the cruell markes of many a bloudy fielde
yet armes till that time did he neuer wield
his angry steede did chide his foming bitt
as much disdayning to the curbe to yield
full iolly knight he seemd and faire did sitt
as one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt


but on his brest a bloudie crosse he bore
the deare remembrance of his dying lord
for whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore
and dead as liuing euer him adord
vpon his shield the like was also scord
for soueraine hope which in his helpe he had
right faithfull true he was in deede and word
but of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad
yet nothing did he dread but euer was ydrad


vpon a great aduenture he was bond
that greatest gloriana to him gaue
that greatest glorious queene of faerie lond
to winne him worship and her grace to haue
which of all earthly things he most did craue
and euer as he rode his hart did earne
to proue his puissance in battell braue
vpon his foe and his new force to learne
vpon his foe a dragon horrible and stearne


a louely ladie rode him faire beside
vpon a lowly asse more white then snow
yet she much whiter but the same did hide
vnder a vele that wimpled was full low
and ouer all a blacke stole she did throw
as one that inly mournd so was she sad
and heauie sat vpon her palfrey slow
seemed in heart some hidden care she had
and by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad


so pure an innocent as that same lambe
she was in life and euery vertuous lore
and by descent from royall lynage came
of ancient kings and queenes that had of yore
their scepters stretcht from east to westerne shore
and all the world in their subiection held
till that infernall feend with foule vprore
forwasted all their land and them expeld
whom to auenge she had this knight from far compeld


behind her farre away a dwarfe did lag
that lasie seemd in being euer last
or wearied with bearing of her bag
of needments at his backe thus as they past
the day with cloudes was suddeine ouercast
and angry ioue an hideous storme of raine
did poure into his lemans lap so fast
that euery wight to shrowd it did constrain
and this faire couple eke to shroud themselues were fain


enforst to seeke some couert nigh at hand
a shadie groue not far away they spide
that promist ayde the tempest to withstand
whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride
did spred so broad that heauens light did hide
not perceable with power of any starre
and all within were pathes and alleies wide
with footing worne and leading inward farre
faire harbour that them seemes so in they entred arre


and foorth they passe with pleasure forward led
ioying to heare the birdes sweete harmony
which therein shrouded from the tempest dred
seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky
much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy
the sayling pine the cedar proud and tall
the vineprop elme the poplar neuer dry
the builder oake sole king of forrests all
the aspine good for staues the cypresse funerall


the laurell meed of mightie conquerours
and poets sage the firre that weepeth still
the willow worne of forlorne paramours
the eugh obedient to the benders will
the birch for shaftes the sallow for the mill
the mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound
the warlike beech the ash for nothing ill
the fruitfull oliue and the platane round
the caruer holme the maple seeldom inward sound


led with delight they thus beguile the way
vntill the blustring storme is ouerblowne
when weening to returne whence they did stray
they cannot finde that path which first was showne
but wander too and fro in wayes vnknowne
furthest from end then when they neerest weene
that makes them doubt their wits be not their owne
so many pathes so many turnings seene
that which of them to take in diuerse doubt they been


at last resoluing forward still to fare
till that some end they finde or in or out
that path they take that beaten seemd most bare
and like to lead the labyrinth about
which when by tract they hunted had throughout
at length it brought them to a hollow caue
amid the thickest woods the champion stout
eftsoones dismounted from his courser braue
and to the dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he gaue


be well aware quoth then that ladie milde
least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash prouoke
the danger hid the place vnknowne and wilde
breedes dreadfull doubts oft fire is without smoke
and perill without show therefore your stroke
sir knight withhold till further triall made
ah ladie said he shame were to reuoke
the forward footing for an hidden shade
vertue giues her selfe light through darkenesse for to wade


yea but quoth she the perill of this place
i better wot then you though now too late
to wish you backe returne with foule disgrace
yet wisedome warnes whilest foot is in the gate
to stay the steppe ere forced to retrate
this is the wandring wood this errours den
a monster vile whom god and man does hate
therefore i read beware fly fly quoth then
the fearefull dwarfe this is no place for liuing men


but full of fire and greedy hardiment
the youthfull knight could not for ought be staide
but forth vnto the darksome hole he went
and looked in his glistring armor made
a litle glooming light much like a shade
by which he saw the vgly monster plaine
halfe like a serpent horribly displaide
but thother halfe did womans shape retaine
most lothsom filthie foule and full of vile disdaine


and as she lay vpon the durtie ground
her huge long taile her den all ouerspred
yet was in knots and many boughtes vpwound
pointed with mortall sting of her there bred
a thousand yong ones which she dayly fed
sucking vpon her poisonous dugs eachone
of sundry shapes yet all ill fauored
soone as that vncouth light vpon them shone
into her mouth they crept and suddain all were gone


their dam vpstart out of her den effraide
and rushed forth hurling her hideous taile
about her cursed head whose folds displaid
were stretcht now forth at length without entraile
she lookt about and seeing one in mayle
armed to point sought backe to turne againe
for light she hated as the deadly bale
ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine
where plaine none might her see nor she see any plaine


which when the valiant elfe perceiud he lept
as lyon fierce vpon the flying pray
and with his trenchand blade her boldly kept
from turning backe and forced her to stay
therewith enragd she loudly gan to bray
and turning fierce her speckled taile aduaunst
threatning her angry sting him to dismay
who nought aghast his mightie hand enhaunst
the stroke down from her head vnto her shoulder glaunst


much daunted with that dint her sence was dazd
yet kindling rage her selfe she gathered round
and all attonce her beastly body raizd
with doubled forces high aboue the ground
tho wrapping vp her wrethed sterne arownd
lept fierce vpon his shield and her huge traine
all suddenly about his body wound
that hand or foot to stirre he stroue in vaine
god helpe the man so wrapt in errours endlesse traine


his lady sad to see his sore constraint
cride out now now sir knight shew what ye bee
add faith vnto your force and be not faint
strangle her else she sure will strangle thee
that when he heard in great perplexitie
his gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine
and knitting all his force got one hand free
wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine
that soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine


therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw
a floud of poyson horrible and blacke
full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets raw
which stunck so vildly that it forst him slacke
his grasping hold and from her turne him backe
her vomit full of bookes and papers was
with loathly frogs and toades which eyes did lacke
and creeping sought way in the weedy gras
her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has


as when old father nilus gins to swell
with timely pride aboue the aegyptian vale
his fattie waues do fertile slime outwell
and ouerflow each plaine and lowly dale
but when his later spring gins to auale
huge heapes of mudd he leaues wherein there breed
ten thousand kindes of creatures partly male
and partly female of his fruitfull seed
such vgly monstrous shapes elswhere may no man reed


the same so sore annoyed has the knight
that welnigh choked with the deadly stinke
his forces faile ne can no longer fight
whose corage when the feend perceiud to shrinke
she poured forth out of her hellish sinke
her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small
deformed monsters fowle and blacke as inke
which swarming all about his legs did crall
and him encombred sore but could not hurt at all


as gentle shepheard in sweete euentide
when ruddy phìbus gins to welke in west
high on an hill his flocke to vewen wide
markes which do byte their hasty supper best
a cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest
all striuing to infixe their feeble stings
that from their noyance he no where can rest
but with his clownish hands their tender wings
he brusheth oft and oft doth mar their murmurings


thus ill bestedd and fearefull more of shame
then of the certaine perill he stood in
halfe furious vnto his foe he came
resolvd in minde all suddenly to win
or soone to lose before he once would lin
and strooke at her with more then manly force
that from her body full of filthie sin
he raft her hatefull head without remorse
a streame of cole black bloud forth gushed from her corse


her scattred brood soone as their parent deare
they saw so rudely falling to the ground
groning full deadly all with troublous feare
gathred themselues about her body round
weening their wonted entrance to haue found
at her wide mouth but being there withstood
they flocked all about her bleeding wound
and sucked vp their dying mothers blood
making her death their life and eke her hurt their good


that detestable sight him much amazde
to see thvnkindly impes of heauen accurst
deuoure their dam on whom while so he gazd
hauing all satisfide their bloudy thurst
their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst
and bowels gushing forth well worthy end
of such as drunke her life the which them nurst
now needeth him no lenger labour spend
his foes haue slaine themselues with whom he should contend


his ladie seeing all that chaunst from farre
approcht in hast to greet his victorie
and said faire knight borne vnder happy starre
who see your vanquisht foes before you lye
well worthy be you of that armorie
wherein ye haue great glory wonne this day
and prooud your strength on a strong enimie
your first aduenture many such i pray
and henceforth euer wish that like succeed it may


then mounted he vpon his steede againe
and with the lady backward sought to wend
that path he kept which beaten was most plaine
ne euer would to any byway bend
but still did follow one vnto the end
the which at last out of the wood them brought
so forward on his way with god to frend
he passed forth and new aduenture sought
long way he trauelled before he heard of ought


at length they chaunst to meet vpon the way
an aged sire in long blacke weedes yclad
his feete all bare his beard all hoarie gray
and by his belt his booke he hanging had
sober he seemde and very sagely sad
and to the ground his eyes were lowly bent
simple in shew and voyde of malice bad
and all the way he prayed as he went
and often knockt his brest as one that did repent


he faire the knight saluted louting low
who faire him quited as that courteous was
and after asked him if he did know
of straunge aduentures which abroad did pas
ah my deare sonne quoth he how should alas
silly old man that liues in hidden cell
bidding his beades all day for his trespas
tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell
with holy father sits not with such things to mell


but if of daunger which hereby doth dwell
and homebred euill ye desire to heare
of a straunge man i can you tidings tell
that wasteth all this countrey farre and neare
of such said he i chiefly do inquere
and shall you well reward to shew the place
in which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare
for to all knighthood it is foule disgrace
that such a cursed creature liues so long a space


far hence quoth he in wastfull wildernesse
his dwelling is by which no liuing wight
may euer passe but thorough great distresse
now sayd the lady draweth toward night
and well i wote that of your later fight
ye all forwearied be for what so strong
but wanting rest will also want of might
the sunne that measures heauen all day long
at night doth baite his steedes the ocean waues emong


then with the sunne take sir your timely rest
and with new day new worke at once begin
vntroubled night they say giues counsell best
right well sir knight ye haue aduised bin
quoth then that aged man the way to win
is wisely to aduise now day is spent
therefore with me ye may take vp your in
for this same night the knight was well content
so with that godly father to his home they went


a little lowly hermitage it was
downe in a dale hard by a forests side
far from resort of people that did pas
in trauell to and froe a little wyde
there was an holy chappell edifyde
wherein the hermite dewly wont to say
his holy things each morne and euentyde
thereby a christall streame did gently play
which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway


arriued there the little house they fill
ne looke for entertainement where none was
rest is their feast and all things at their will
the noblest mind the best contentment has
with faire discourse the euening so they pas
for that old man of pleasing wordes had store
and well could file his tongue as smooth as glas
he told of saintes and popes and euermore
he strowd an auemary after and before


the drouping night thus creepeth on them fast
and the sad humour loading their eye liddes
as messenger of morpheus on them cast
sweet slombring deaw the which to sleepe them biddes
vnto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes
where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes
he to his study goes and there amiddes
his magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes
he seekes out mighty charmes to trouble sleepy mindes


then choosing out few wordes most horrible
let none them read thereof did verses frame
with which and other spelles like terrible
he bad awake blacke plutoes griesly dame
and cursed heauen and spake reprochfull shame
of highest god the lord of life and light
a bold bad man that dard to call by name
great gorgon prince of darknesse and dead night
at which cocytus quakes and styx is put to flight


and forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred
legions of sprights the which like little flyes
fluttring about his euer damned hed
awaite whereto their seruice he applyes
to aide his friends or fray his enimies
of those he chose out two the falsest twoo
and fittest for to forge trueseeming lyes
the one of them he gaue a message too
the other by him selfe staide other worke to doo


he making speedy way through spersed ayre
and through the world of waters wide and deepe
to morpheus house doth hastily repaire
amid the bowels of the earth full steepe
and low where dawning day doth neuer peepe
his dwelling is there tethys his wet bed
doth euer wash and cynthia still doth steepe
in siluer deaw his euerdrouping hed
whiles sad night ouer him her mantle black doth spred


whose double gates he findeth locked fast
the one faire framd of burnisht yuory
the other all with siluer ouercast
and wakefull dogges before them farre do lye
watching to banish care their enimy
who oft is wont to trouble gentle sleepe
by them the sprite doth passe in quietly
and vnto morpheus comes whom drowned deepe
in drowsie fit he findes of nothing he takes keepe


and more to lulle him in his slumber soft
a trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe
and euerdrizling raine vpon the loft
mixt with a murmuring winde much like the sowne
of swarming bees did cast him in a swowne
no other noyse nor peoples troublous cryes
as still are wont tannoy the walled towne
might there be heard but carelesse quiet lyes
wrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes


the messenger approching to him spake
but his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine
so sound he slept that nought mought him awake
then rudely he him thrust and pusht with paine
whereat he gan to stretch but he againe
shooke him so hard that forced him to speake
as one then in a dreame whose dryer braine
is tost with troubled sights and fancies weake
he mumbled soft but would not all his silence breake


the sprite then gan more boldly him to wake
and threatned vnto him the dreaded name
of hecate whereat he gan to quake
and lifting vp his lumpish head with blame
halfe angry asked him for what he came
hither quoth he me archimago sent
he that the stubborne sprites can wisely tame
he bids thee to him send for his intent
a fit false dreame that can delude the sleepers sent


the god obayde and calling forth straight way
a diuerse dreame out of his prison darke
deliuered it to him and downe did lay
his heauie head deuoide of carefull carke
whose sences all were straight benumbd and starke
he backe returning by the yuorie dore
remounted vp as light as chearefull larke
and on his litle winges the dreame he bore
in hast vnto his lord where he him left afore


who all this while with charmes and hidden artes
had made a lady of that other spright
and framd of liquid ayre her tender partes
so liuely and so like in all mens sight
that weaker sence it could haue rauisht quight
the maker selfe for all his wondrous witt
was nigh beguiled with so goodly sight
her all in white he clad and ouer it
cast a blacke stole most like to seeme for vna fit


now when that ydle dreame was to him brought
vnto that elfin knight he bad him fly
where he slept soundly void of euill thought
and with false shewes abuse his fantasy
in sort as he him schooled priuily
and that new creature borne without her dew
full of the makers guile with vsage sly
he taught to imitate that lady trew
whose semblance she did carrie vnder feigned hew


thus well instructed to their worke they hast
and comming where the knight in slomber lay
the one vpon his hardy head him plast
and made him dreame of loues and lustfull play
that nigh his manly hart did melt away
bathed in wanton blis and wicked ioy
then seemed him his lady by him lay
and to him playnd how that false winged boy
her chast hart had subdewd to learne dame pleasures toy


and she her selfe of beautie soueraigne queene
faire venus seemde vnto his bed to bring
her whom he waking euermore did weene
to be the chastest flowre that ay did spring
on earthly braunch the daughter of a king
now a loose leman to vile seruice bound
and eke the graces seemed all to sing
hymen to hymen dauncing all around
whilst freshest flora her with yuie girlond crownd


in this great passion of vnwonted lust
or wonted feare of doing ought amis
he started vp as seeming to mistrust
some secret ill or hidden foe of his
lo there before his face his lady is
vnder blake stole hyding her bayted hooke
and as halfe blushing offred him to kis
with gentle blandishment and louely looke
most like that virgin true which for her knight him took


all cleane dismayd to see so vncouth sight
and halfe enraged at her shamelesse guise
he thought haue slaine her in his fierce despight
but hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise
he stayde his hand and gan himselfe aduise
to proue his sense and tempt her faigned truth
wringing her hands in wemens pitteous wise
tho can she weepe to stirre vp gentle ruth
both for her noble bloud and for her tender youth


and said ah sir my liege lord and my loue
shall i accuse the hidden cruell fate
and mightie causes wrought in heauen aboue
or the blind god that doth me thus amate
for hoped loue to winne me certaine hate
yet thus perforce he bids me do or die
die is my dew yet rew my wretched state
you whom my hard auenging destinie
hath made iudge of my life or death indifferently


your owne deare sake forst me at first to leaue
my fathers kingdome there she stopt with teares
her swollen hart her speach seemd to bereaue
and then againe begun my weaker yeares
captiud to fortune and frayle worldly feares
fly to your faith for succour and sure ayde
let me not dye in languor and long teares
why dame quoth he what hath ye thus dismayd
what frayes ye that were wont to comfort me affrayd


loue of your selfe she said and deare constraint
lets me not sleepe but wast the wearie night
in secret anguish and vnpittied plaint
whiles you in carelesse sleepe are drowned quight
her doubtfull words made that redoubted knight
suspect her truth yet since novntruth he knew
her fawning loue with foule disdainefull spight
he would not shend but said deare dame i rew
that for my sake vnknowne such griefe vnto you grew


assure your selfe it fell not all to ground
for all so deare as life is to my hart
i deeme your loue and hold me to you bound
ne let vaine feares procure your needlesse smart
where cause is none but to your rest depart
not all content yet seemd she to appease
her mournefull plaintes beguiled of her art
and fed with words that could not chuse but please
so slyding softly forth she turnd as to her ease


long after lay he musing at her mood
much grieud to thinke that gentle dame so light
for whose defence he was to shed his blood
at last dull wearinesse of former fight
hauing yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright
that troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine
with bowres and beds and ladies deare delight
but when he saw his labour all was vaine
with that misformed spright he backe returnd againe


the guilefull great enchaunter parts
the redcrosse knight from truth
into whose stead faire falshood steps
and workes him wofull ruth


by this the northerne wagoner had set
his seuenfold teme behind the stedfast starre
that was in ocean waues yet neuer wet
but firme is fixt and sendeth light from farre
to all that in the wide deepe wandring arre
and chearefull chaunticlere with his note shrill
had warned once that phoebus fiery carre
in hast was climbing vp the easterne hill
full enuious that night so long his roome did fill


when those accursed messengers of hell
that feigning dreame and that faireforged spright
came to their wicked maister and gan tell
their bootelesse paines and ill succeeding night
who all in rage to see his skilfull might
deluded so gan threaten hellish paine
and sad proserpines wrath them to affright
but when he saw his threatning was but vaine
he cast about and searcht his balefull bookes againe


eftsoones he tooke that miscreated faire
and that false other spright on whom he spred
a seeming body of the subtile aire
like a young squire in loues and lustyhed
his wanton dayes that euer loosely led
without regard of armes and dreaded fight
those two he tooke and in a secret bed
couered with darknesse and misdeeming night
them both together laid to ioy in vaine delight


forthwith he runnes with feigned faithfull hast
vnto his guest who after troublous sights
and dreames gan now to take more sound repast
whom suddenly he wakes with fearefull frights
as one aghast with feends or damned sprights
and to him cals rise rise vnhappy swaine
that here wex old in sleepe whiles wicked wights
haue knit themselues in venus shamefull chaine
come see where your false lady doth her honour staine


all in amaze he suddenly vp start
with sword in hand and with the old man went
who soone him brought into a secret part
where that false couple were full closely ment
in wanton lust and lewd embracement
which when he saw he burnt with gealous fire
the eye of reason was with rage yblent
and would haue slaine them in his furious ire
but hardly was restreined of that aged sire


returning to his bed in torment great
and bitter anguish of his guiltie sight
he could not rest but did his stout heart eat
and wast his inward gall with deepe despight
yrkesome of life and too long lingring night
at last faire hesperus in highest skie
had spent his lampe and brought forth dawning light
then vp he rose and clad him hastily
the dwarfe him brought his steed so both away do fly


now when the rosyfingred morning faire
weary of aged tithones saffron bed
had spred her purple robe through deawy aire
and the high hils titan discouered
the royall virgin shooke off drowsyhed
and rising forth out of her baser bowre
lookt for her knight who far away was fled
and for her dwarfe that wont to wait each houre
then gan she waile and weepe to see that woefull stowre


and after him she rode with so much speede
as her slow beast could make but all in vaine
for him so far had borne his lightfoot steede
pricked with wrath and fiery fierce disdaine
that him to follow was but fruitlesse paine
yet she her weary limbes would neuer rest
but euery hill and dale each wood and plaine
did search sore grieued in her gentle brest
he so vngently left her whom she loued best


but subtill archimago when his guests
he saw diuided into double parts
and vna wandring in woods and forrests
thend of his drift he praisd his diuelish arts
that had such might ouer true meaning harts
yet rests not so but other meanes doth make
how he may worke vnto her further smarts
for her he hated as the hissing snake
and in her many troubles did most pleasure take


he then deuisde himselfe how to disguise
for by his mightie science he could take
as many formes and shapes in seeming wise
as euer proteus to himselfe could make
sometime a fowle sometime a fish in lake
now like a foxe now like a dragon fell
that of himselfe he oft for feare would quake
and oft would flie away o who can tell
the hidden power of herbes and might of magicke spell


but now seemde best the person to put on
of that good knight his late beguiled guest
in mighty armes he was yclad anon
and siluer shield vpon his coward brest
a bloudy crosse and on his crauen crest
a bounch of haires discolourd diuersly
full iolly knight he seemde and well addrest
and when he sate vpon his courser free
saint george himself ye would haue deemed him to be


but he the knight whose semblaunt he did beare
the true saint george was wandred far away
still flying from his thoughts and gealous feare
will was his guide and griefe led him astray
at last him chaunst to meete vpon the way
a faithlesse sarazin all armd to point
in whose great shield was writ with letters gay
sans foy full large of limbe and euery ioint
he was and cared not for god or man a point


he had a faire companion of his way
a goodly lady clad in scarlot red
purfled with gold and pearle of rich assay
and like a persian mitre on her hed
she wore with crownes and owches garnished
the which her lauish louers to her gaue
her wanton palfrey all was ouerspred
with tinsell trappings wouen like a waue
whose bridle rung with golden bels and bosses braue


with faire disport and courting dalliaunce
she intertainde her louer all the way
but when she saw the knight his speare aduaunce
she soone left off her mirth and wanton play
and bad her knight addresse him to the fray
his foe was nigh at hand he prickt with pride
and hope to winne his ladies heart that day
forth spurred fast adowne his coursers side
the red bloud trickling staind the way as he did ride


the knight of the redcrosse when him he spide
spurring so hote with rage dispiteous
gan fairely couch his speare and towards ride
soone meete they both both fell and furious
that daunted with their forces hideous
their steeds do stagger and amazed stand
and eke themselues too rudely rigorous
astonied with the stroke of their owne hand
do backe rebut and each to other yeeldeth land


as when two rams stird with ambitious pride
fight for the rule of the rich fleeced flocke
their horned fronts so fierce on either side
do meete that with the terrour of the shocke
astonied both stand sencelesse as a blocke
forgetfull of the hanging victory
so stood these twaine vnmoued as a rocke
both staring fierce and holding idely
the broken reliques of their former cruelty


the sarazin sore daunted with the buffe
snatcheth his sword and fiercely to him flies
who well it wards and quyteth cuff with cuff
each others equall puissaunce enuies
and through their iron sides with cruell spies
does seeke to perce repining courage yields
no foote to foe the flashing fier flies
as from a forge out of their burning shields
and streames of purple bloud new dies the verdant fields


curse on that crosse quoth then the sarazin
that keepes thy body from the bitter fit
dead long ygoe i wote thou haddest bin
had not that charme from thee forwarned it
but yet i warne thee now assured sitt
and hide thy head therewith vpon his crest
with rigour so outrageous he smitt
that a large share it hewd out of the rest
and glauncing downe his shield from blame him fairely blest


who thereat wondrous wroth the sleeping spark
of natiue vertue gan eftsoones reuiue
and at his haughtie helmet making mark
so hugely stroke that it the steele did riue
and cleft his head he tumbling downe aliue
with bloudy mouth his mother earth did kis
greeting his graue his grudging ghost did striue
with the fraile flesh at last it flitted is
whither the soules do fly of men that liue amis


the lady when she saw her champion fall
like the old ruines of a broken towre
staid not to waile his woefull funerall
but from him fled away with all her powre
who after her as hastily gan scowre
bidding the dwarfe with him to bring away
the sarazins shield signe of the conqueroure
her soone he ouertooke and bad to stay
for present cause was none of dread her to dismay


she turning backe with ruefull countenaunce
cride mercy mercy sir vouchsafe to show
on silly dame subiect to hard mischaunce
and to your mighty will her humblesse low
in so ritch weedes and seeming glorious show
did much emmoue his stout heroicke heart
and said deare dame your suddein ouerthrow
much rueth me but now put feare apart
and tell both who ye be and who that tooke your part


melting in teares then gan she thus lament
the wretched woman whom vnhappy howre
hath now made thrall to your commandement
before that angry heauens list to lowre
and fortune false betraide me to your powre
was o what now auaileth that i was
borne the sole daughter of an emperour
he that the wide west vnder his rule has
and high hath set his throne where tiberis doth pas


he in the first flowre of my freshest age
betrothed me vnto the onely haire
of a most mighty king most rich and sage
was neuer prince so faithfull and so faire
was neuer prince so meeke and debonaire
but ere my hoped day of spousall shone
my dearest lord fell from high honours staire
into the hands of his accursed fone
and cruelly was slaine that shall i euer mone


his blessed body spoild of liuely breath
was afterward i know not how conuaid
and fro me hid of whose most innocent death
when tidings came to me vnhappy maid
o how great sorrow my sad soule assaid
then forth i went his woefull corse to find
and many yeares throughout the world i straid
a virgin widow whose deepe wounded mind
with loue long time did languish as the striken hind


at last it chaunced this proud sarazin
to meete me wandring who perforce me led
with him away but yet could neuer win
the fort that ladies hold in soueraigne dread
there lies he now with foule dishonour dead
who whiles he liude was called proud sans foy
the eldest of three brethren all three bred
of one bad sire whose youngest is sans ioy
and twixt them both was borne the bloudy bold sans loy


in this sad plight friendlesse vnfortunate
now miserable i fidessa dwell
crauing of you in pitty of my state
to do none ill if please ye not do well
he in great passion all this while did dwell
more busying his quicke eyes her face to view
then his dull eares to heare what she did tell
and said faire lady hart of flint would rew
the vndeserued woes and sorrowes which ye shew


henceforth in safe assuraunce may ye rest
hauing both found a new friend you to aid
and lost an old foe that did you molest
better new friend then an old foe is said
with chaunge of cheare the seeming simple maid
let fall her eyen as shamefast to the earth
and yeelding soft in that she nought gainsaid
so forth they rode he feining seemely merth
and she coy lookes so dainty they say maketh derth


long time they thus together traueiled
till weary of their way they came at last
where grew two goodly trees that faire did spred
their armes abroad with gray mosse ouercast
and their greene leaues trembling with euery blast
made a calme shadow far in compasse round
the fearefull shepheard often there aghast
vnder them neuer sat ne wont there sound
his mery oaten pipe but shund thvnlucky ground


but this good knight soone as he them can spie
for the coole shade him thither hastly got
for golden phoebus now ymounted hie
from fiery wheeles of his faire chariot
hurled his beame so scorching cruell hot
that liuing creature mote it not abide
and his new lady it endured not
there they alight in hope themselues to hide
from the fierce heat and rest their weary limbs a tide


faire seemely pleasaunce each to other makes
with goodly purposes there as they sit
and in his falsed fancy he her takes
to be the fairest wight that liued yit
which to expresse he bends his gentle wit
and thinking of those braunches greene to frame
a girlond for her dainty forehead fit
he pluckt a bough out of whose rift there came
small drops of gory bloud that trickled downe the same


therewith a piteous yelling voyce was heard
crying o spare with guilty hands to teare
my tender sides in this rough rynd embard
but fly ah fly far hence away for feare
least to you hap that happened to me heare
and to this wretched lady my deare loue
o too deare loue loue bought with death too deare
astond he stood and vp his haire did houe
and with that suddein horror could no member moue


at last whenas the dreadfull passion
was ouerpast and manhood well awake
yet musing at the straunge occasion
and doubting much his sence he thus bespake
what voyce of damned ghost from limbo lake
or guilefull spright wandring in empty aire
both which fraile men do oftentimes mistake
sends to my doubtfull eares these speaches rare
and ruefull plaints me bidding guiltlesse bloud to spare


then groning deepe nor damned ghost quoth he
nor guilefull sprite to thee these wordes doth speake
but once a man fradubio now a tree
wretched man wretched tree whose nature weake
a cruell witch her cursed will to wreake
hath thus transformd and plast in open plaines
where boreas doth blow full bitter bleake
and scorching sunne does dry my secret vaines
for though a tree i seeme yet cold and heat me paines


say on fradubio then or man or tree
quoth then the knight by whose mischieuous arts
art thou misshaped thus as now i see
he oft finds medcine who his griefe imparts
but double griefs afflict concealing harts
as raging flames who striueth to suppresse
the author then said he of all my smarts
is one duessa a false sorceresse
that many errãt knights hath brought to wretchednesse


in prime of youthly yeares when corage hot
the fire of loue and ioy of cheualree
first kindled in my brest it was my lot
to loue this gentle lady whom ye see
now not a lady but a seeming tree
with whom as once i rode accompanyde
me chaunced of a knight encountred bee
that had a like faire lady by his syde
like a faire lady but did fowle duessa hyde


whose forged beauty he did take in hand
all other dames to haue exceeded farre
i in defence of mine did likewise stand
mine that did then shine as the morning starre
so both to battell fierce arraunged arre
in which his harder fortune was to fall
vnder my speare such is the dye of warre
his lady left as a prise martiall
did yield her comely person to be at my call


so doubly loud of ladies vnlike faire
thone seeming such the other such indeede
one day in doubt i cast for to compare
whether in beauties glorie did exceede
a rosy girlond was the victors meede
both seemde to win and both seemde won to bee
so hard the discord was to be agreede
frælissa was as faire as faire mote bee
and euer false duessa seemde as faire as shee


the wicked witch now seeing all this while
the doubtfull ballaunce equally to sway
what not by right she cast to win by guile
and by her hellish science raisd streightway
a foggy mist that ouercast the day
and a dull blast that breathing on her face
dimmed her former beauties shining ray
and with foule vgly forme did her disgrace
then was she faire alone when none was faire in place


then cride she out fye fye deformed wight
whose borrowed beautie now appeareth plaine
to haue before bewitched all mens sight
o leaue her soone or let her soone be slaine
her loathly visage viewing with disdaine
eftsoones i thought her such as she me told
and would haue kild her but with faigned paine
the false witch did my wrathfull hand withhold
so left her where she now is turnd to treen mould


thensforth i tooke duessa for my dame
and in the witch vnweeting ioyd long time
ne euer wist but that she was the same
till on a day that day is euery prime
when witches wont do penance for their crime
i chaunst to see her in her proper hew
bathing her selfe in origane and thyme
a filthy foule old woman i did vew
that euer to haue toucht her i did deadly rew


her neather partes misshapen monstruous
were hidd in water that i could not see
but they did seeme more foule and hideous
then womans shape man would beleeue to bee
thensforth from her most beastly companie
i gan refraine in minde to slip away
soone as appeard safe opportunitie
for danger great if not assurd decay
i saw before mine eyes if i were knowne to stray


the diuelish hag by chaunges of my cheare
perceiud my thought and drownd in sleepie night
with wicked herbes and ointments did besmeare
my bodie all through charmes and magicke might
that all my senses were bereaued quight
then brought she me into this desert waste
and by my wretched louers side me pight
where now enclosd in wooden wals full faste
banisht from liuing wights our wearie dayes we waste


but how long time said then the elfin knight
are you in this misformed house to dwell
we may not chaunge quoth he this euil plight
till we be bathed in a liuing well
that is the terme prescribed by the spell
o how said he mote i that well out find
that may restore you to your wonted well
time and suffised fates to former kynd
shall vs restore none else from hence may vs vnbynd


the false duessa now fidessa hight
heard how in vaine fradubio did lament
and knew well all was true but the good knight
full of sad feare and ghastly dreriment
when all this speech the liuing tree had spent
the bleeding bough did thrust into the ground
that from the bloud he might be innocent
and with fresh clay did close the wooden wound
then turning to his lady dead with feare her found


her seeming dead he found with feigned feare
as all vnweeting of that well she knew
and paynd himselfe with busie care to reare
her out of carelesse swowne her eylids blew
and dimmed sight with pale and deadly hew
at last she vp gan lift with trembling cheare
her vp he tooke too simple and too trew
and oft her kist at length all passed feare
he set her on her steede and forward forth did beare


forsaken truth long seekes her loue
and makes the lyon mylde
marres blind deuotions mart and fals
in hand of leachour vylde


nought there vnder heauns wilde hollownesse
that moues more deare compassion of mind
then beautie brought tvnworthy wretchednesse
through enuies snares or fortunes freakes vnkind
i whether lately through her brightnesse blind
or through alleageance and fast fealtie
which i do owe vnto all woman kind
feele my heart perst with so great agonie
when such i see that all for pittie i could die


and now it is empassioned so deepe
for fairest vnaes sake of whom i sing
that my fraile eyes these lines with teares do steepe
to thinke how she through guilefull handeling
though true as touch though daughter of a king
though faire as euer liuing wight was faire
though nor in word nor deede ill meriting
is from her knight diuorced in despaire
and her due loues deriud to that vile witches share


yet she most faithfull ladie all this while
forsaken wofull solitarie mayd
farre from all peoples prease as in exile
in wildernesse and wastfull deserts strayd
to seeke her knight who subtilly betrayd
through that late vision which thenchaunter wrought
had her abandond she of nought affrayd
through woods and wastnesse wide him daily sought
yet wished tydings none of him vnto her brought


one day nigh wearie of the yrkesome way
from her vnhastie beast she did alight
and on the grasse her daintie limbes did lay
in secret shadow farre from all mens sight
from her faire head her fillet she vndight
and laid her stole aside her angels face
as the great eye of heauen shyned bright
and made a sunshine in the shadie place
did neuer mortall eye behold such heauenly grace


it fortuned out of the thickest wood
a ramping lyon rushed suddainly
hunting full greedie after saluage blood
soone as the royall virgin he did spy
with gaping mouth at her ran greedily
to haue attonce deuourd her tender corse
but to the pray when as he drew more ny
his bloudie rage asswaged with remorse
and with the sight amazd forgat his furious forse


in stead thereof he kist her wearie feet
and lickt her lilly hands with fawning tong
as he her wronged innocence did weet
o how can beautie maister the most strong
and simple truth subdue auenging wrong
whose yeelded pride and proud submission
still dreading death when she had marked long
her hart gan melt in great compassion
and drizling teares did shed for pure affection


the lyon lord of euerie beast in field
quoth she his princely puissance doth abate
and mightie proud to humble weake does yield
forgetfull of the hungry rage which late
him prickt in pittie of my sad estate
but he my lyon and my noble lord
how does he find in cruell hart to hate
her that him loud and euer most adord
as the god of my life why hath he me abhord


redounding teares did choke thend of her plaint
which softly ecchoed from the neighbour wood
and sad to see her sorrowfull constraint
the kingly beast vpon her gazing stood
with pittie calmd downe fell his angry mood
at last in close hart shutting vp her paine
arose the virgin borne of heauenly brood
and to her snowy palfrey got againe
to seeke her strayed champion if she might attaine


the lyon would not leaue her desolate
but with her went along as a strong gard
of her chast person and a faithfull mate
of her sad troubles and misfortunes hard
still when she slept he kept both watch and ward
and when she wakt he waited diligent
with humble seruice to her will prepard
from her faire eyes he tooke commaundement
and euer by her lookes conceiued her intent


long she thus traueiled through deserts wyde
by which she thought her wandring knight shold pas
yet neuer shew of liuing wight espyde
till that at length she found the troden gras
in which the tract of peoples footing was
vnder the steepe foot of a mountaine hore
the same she followes till at last she has
a damzell spyde slow footing her before
that on her shoulders sad a pot of water bore


to whom approching she to her gan call
to weet if dwelling place were nigh at hand
but the rude wench her answerd nought at all
she could not heare nor speake nor vnderstand
till seeing by her side the lyon stand
with suddaine feare her pitcher downe she threw
and fled away for neuer in that land
face of faire ladie she before did vew
and that dread lyons looke her cast in deadly hew


full fast she fled ne euer lookt behynd
as if her life vpon the wager lay
and home she came whereas her mother blynd
sate in eternall night nought could she say
but suddaine catching hold did her dismay
with quaking hands and other signs of feare
who full of ghastly fright and cold affray
gan shut the dore by this arriued there
dame vna wearie dame and entrance did requere


which when none yeelded her vnruly page
with his rude clawes the wicket open rent
and let her in where of his cruell rage
nigh dead with feare and faint astonishment
she found them both in darkesome corner pent
where that old woman day and night did pray
vpon her beades deuoutly penitent
nine hundred pater nosters euery day
and thrise nine hundred aues she was wont to say


and to augment her painefull pennance more
thrise euery weeke in ashes she did sit
and next her wrinkled skin rough sackcloth wore
and thrise three times did fast from any bit
but now for feare her beads she did forget
whose needlesse dread for to remoue away
faire vna framed words and countnance fit
which hardly doen at length she gan them pray
that in their cotage small that night she rest her may


the day is spent and commeth drowsie night
when euery creature shrowded is in sleepe
sad vna downe her laies in wearie plight
and at her feet the lyon watch doth keepe
in stead of rest she does lament and weepe
for the late losse of her deare loued knight
and sighes and grones and euermore does steepe
her tender brest in bitter teares all night
all night she thinks too long and often lookes for light


now when aldeboran was mounted hie
aboue the shynie cassiopeias chaire
and all in deadly sleepe did drowned lie
one knocked at the dore and in would fare
he knocked fast and often curst and sware
that readie entrance was not at his call
for on his backe a heauy load he bare
of nightly stelths and pillage seuerall
which he had got abroad by purchase criminall


he was to weete a stout and sturdie thiefe
wont to robbe churches of their ornaments
and poore mens boxes of their due reliefe
which giuen was to them for good intents
the holy saints of their rich vestiments
he did disrobe when all men carelesse slept
and spoild the priests of their habiliments
whiles none the holy things in safety kept
then he by cunning sleights in at the window crept


and all that he by right or wrong could find
vnto this house he brought and did bestow
vpon the daughter of this woman blind
abessa daughter of corceca slow
with whom he whoredome vsd that few did know
and fed her fat with feast of offerings
and plentie which in all the land did grow
ne spared he to giue her gold and rings
and now he to her brought part of his stolen things


thus long the dore with rage and threats he bet
yet of those fearefull women none durst rize
the lyon frayed them him in to let
he would no longer stay him to aduize
but open breakes the dore in furious wize
and entring is when that disdainfull beast
encountring fierce him suddaine doth surprize
and seizing cruell clawes on trembling brest
vnder his lordly foot him proudly hath supprest


him booteth not resist nor succour call
his bleeding hart is in the vengers hand
who streight him rent in thousand peeces small
and quite dismembred hath the thirstie land
drunke vp his life his corse left on the strand
his fearefull friends weare out the wofull night
ne dare to weepe nor seeme to vnderstand
the heauie hap which on them is alight
affraid least to themselues the like mishappen might


now when broad day the world discouered has
vp vna rose vp rose the lyon eke
and on their former iourney forward pas
in wayes vnknowne her wandring knight to seeke
with paines farre passing that long wandring greeke
that for his loue refused deitie
such were the labours of this lady meeke
still seeking him that from her still did flie
then furthest from her hope when most she weened nie


soone as she parted thence the fearefull twaine
that blind old woman and her daughter deare
came forth and finding kirkrapine there slaine
for anguish great they gan to rend their heare
and beat their brests and naked flesh to teare
and when they both had wept and wayld their fill
then forth they ranne like two amazed deare
halfe mad through malice and reuenging will
to follow her that was the causer of their ill


whom ouertaking they gan loudly bray
with hollow howling and lamenting cry
shamefully at her rayling all the way
and her accusing of dishonesty
that was the flowre of faith and chastity
and still amidst her rayling she did pray
that plagues and mischiefs and long misery
might fall on her and follow all the way
and that in endlesse error she might euer stray


but when she saw her prayers nought preuaile
she backe returned with some labour lost
and in the way as she did weepe and waile
a knight her met in mighty armes embost
yet knight was not for all his bragging bost
but subtill archimag that vna sought
by traynes into new troubles to haue tost
of that old woman tydings he besought
if that of such a ladie she could tellen ought


therewith she gan her passion to renew
and cry and curse and raile and rend her heare
saying that harlot she too lately knew
that causd her shed so many a bitter teare
and so forth told the story of her feare
much seemed he to mone her haplesse chaunce
and after for that ladie did inquere
which being taught he forward gan aduaunce
his fair enchaunted steed and eke his charmed launce


ere long he came where vna traueild slow
and that wilde champion wayting her besyde
whom seeing such for dread he durst not show
himselfe too nigh at hand but turned wyde
vnto an hill from whence when she him spyde
by his like seeming shield her knight by name
she weend it was and towards him gan ryde
approching nigh she wist it was the same
and with faire fearefull humblesse towards him shee came


and weeping said ah my long lacked lord
where haue ye bene thus long out of my sight
much feared i to haue bene quite abhord
or ought haue done that ye displeasen might
that should as death vnto my deare hart light
for since mine eye your ioyous sight did mis
my chearefull day is turnd to chearelesse night
and eke my night of death the shadow is
but welcome now my light and shining lampe of blis


he thereto meeting said my dearest dame
farre be it from your thought and fro my will
to thinke that knighthood i so much should shame
as you to leaue that haue me loued still
and chose in faery court of meere goodwill
where noblest knights were to be found on earth
the earth shall sooner leaue her kindly skill
to bring forth fruit and make eternall derth
then i leaue you my liefe yborne of heauenly berth


and sooth to say why i left you so long
was for to seeke aduenture in strange place
where archimago said a felon strong
to many knights did daily worke disgrace
but knight he now shall neuer more deface
good cause of mine excuse that mote ye please
well to accept and euermore embrace
my faithfull seruice that by land and seas
haue vowd you to defend now then your plaint appease


his louely words her seemd due recompence
of all her passed paines one louing howre
for many yeares of sorrow can dispence
a dram of sweet is worth a pound of sowre
she has forgot how many a wofull stowre
for him she late endurd she speakes no more
of past true is that true loue hath no powre
to looken backe his eyes be fixt before
before her stands her knight for whom she toyld so sore


much like as when the beaten marinere
that long hath wandred in the ocean wide
oft soust in swelling tethys saltish teare
and long time hauing tand his tawney hide
with blustring breath of heauen that none can bide
and scorching flames of fierce orions hound
soone as the port from farre he has espide
his chearefull whistle merrily doth sound
and nereus crownes with cups his mates him pledg around


such ioy made vna when her knight she found
and eke thenchaunter ioyous seemd no lesse
then the glad marchant that does vew from ground
his ship farre come from watrie wildernesse
he hurles out vowes and neptune oft doth blesse
so forth they past and all the way they spent
discoursing of her dreadfull late distresse
in which he askt her what the lyon ment
who told her all that fell in iourney as she went


they had not ridden farre when they might see
one pricking towards them with hastie heat
full strongly armd and on a courser free
that through his fiercenesse fomed all with sweat
and the sharpe yron did for anger eat
when his hot ryder spurd his chauffed side
his looke was sterne and seemed still to threat
cruell reuenge which he in hart did hyde
and on his shield sans loy in bloudie lines was dyde


when nigh he drew vnto this gentle payre
and saw the redcrosse which the knight did beare
he burnt in fire and gan eftsoones prepare
himselfe to battell with his couched speare
loth was that other and did faint through feare
to taste thvntryed dint of deadly steele
but yet his lady did so well him cheare
that hope of new good hap he gan to feele
so bent his speare and spurnd his horse with yron heele


but that proud paynim forward came so fierce
and full of wrath that with his sharphead speare
through vainely crossed shield he quite did pierce
and had his staggering steede not shrunke for feare
through shield and bodie eke he should him beare
yet so great was the puissance of his push
that from his saddle quite he did him beare
he tombling rudely downe to ground did rush
and from his gored wound a well of bloud did gush


dismounting lightly from his loftie steed
he to him lept in mind to reaue his life
and proudly said lo there the worthie meed
of him that slew sansfoy with bloudie knife
henceforth his ghost freed from repining strife
in peace may passen ouer lethe lake
when morning altars purgd with enemies life
the blacke infernall furies doen aslake
life from sansfoy thou tookst sansloy shall frõ thee take


therewith in haste his helmet gan vnlace
till vna cride o hold that heauie hand
deare sir what euer that thou be in place
enough is that thy foe doth vanquisht stand
now at thy mercy mercie not withstand
for he is one the truest knight aliue
though conquered now he lie on lowly land
and whilest him fortune fauourd faire did thriue
in bloudie field therefore of life him not depriue


her piteous words might not abate his rage
but rudely rending vp his helmet would
haue slaine him straight but when he sees his age
and hoarie head of archimago old
his hastie hand he doth amazed hold
and halfe ashamed wondred at the sight
for the old man well knew he though vntold
in charmes and magicke to haue wondrous might
ne euer wont in field ne in round lists to fight


and said why archimago lucklesse syre
what doe i see what hard mishap is this
that hath thee hither brought to taste mine yre
or thine the fault or mine the error is
in stead of foe to wound my friend amis
he answered nought but in a traunce still lay
and on those guilefull dazed eyes of his
the cloud of death did sit which doen away
he left him lying so ne would no lenger stay


but to the virgin comes who all this while
amased stands her selfe so mockt to see
by him who has the guerdon of his guile
for so misfeigning her true knight to bee
yet is she now in more perplexitie
left in the hand of that same paynim bold
from whom her booteth not at all to flie
who by her cleanly garment catching hold
her from her palfrey pluckt her visage to behold


but her fierce seruant full of kingly awe
and high disdaine whenas his soueraine dame
so rudely handled by her foe he sawe
with gaping iawes full greedy at him came
and ramping on his shield did weene the same
haue reft away with his sharpe rending clawes
but he was stout and lust did now inflame
his corage more that frõ his griping pawes
he hath his shield redeemd and foorth his sword he drawes


o then too weake and feeble was the forse
of saluage beast his puissance to withstand
for he was strong and of so mightie corse
as euer wielded speare in warlike hand
and feates of armes did wisely vnderstand
eftsoones he perced through his chaufed chest
with thrilling point of deadly yron brand
and launcht his lordly hart with death opprest
he roard aloud whiles life forsooke his stubborne brest


who now is left to keepe the forlorne maid
from raging spoile of lawlesse victors will
her faithfull gard remoud her hope dismaid
her selfe a yeelded pray to saue or spill
he now lord of the field his pride to fill
with foule reproches and disdainfull spight
her vildly entertaines and will or nill
beares her away vpon his courser light
her prayers nought preuaile his rage is more of might


and all the way with great lamenting paine
and piteous plaints she filleth his dull eares
that stony hart could riuen haue in twaine
and all the way she wets with flowing teares
but he enragd with rancor nothing heares
her seruile beast yet would not leaue her so
but followes her farre off ne ought he feares
to be partaker of her wandring woe
more mild in beastly kind then that her beastly foe


to sinfull house of pride duessa
guides the faithfull knight
where brothers death to wreak sansioy
doth chalenge him to fight


young knight what euer that dost armes professe
and through long labours huntest after fame
beware of fraud beware of ficklenesse
in choice and change of thy deare loued dame
least thou of her beleeue too lightly blame
and rash misweening doe thy hart remoue
for vnto knight there is no greater shame
then lightnesse and inconstancie in loue
that doth this redcrosse knights ensample plainly proue


who after that he had faire vna lorne
through light misdeeming of her loialtie
and false duessa in her sted had borne
called fidess and so supposd to bee
long with her traueild till at last they see
a goodly building brauely garnished
the house of mightie prince it seemd to bee
and towards it a broad high way that led
all bare through peoples feet which thither traueiled


great troupes of people traueild thitherward
both day and night of each degree and place
but few returned hauing scaped hard
with balefull beggerie or foule disgrace
which euer after in most wretched case
like loathsome lazars by the hedges lay
thither duessa bad him bend his pace
for she is wearie of the toilesome way
and also nigh consumed is the lingring day


a stately pallace built of squared bricke
which cunningly was without morter laid
whose wals were high but nothing strong nor thick
and golden foile all ouer them displaid
that purest skye with brightnesse they dismaid
high lifted vp were many loftie towres
and goodly galleries farre ouer laid
full of faire windowes and delightfull bowres
and on the top a diall told the timely howres


it was a goodly heape for to behould
and spake the praises of the workmans wit
but full great pittie that so faire a mould
did on so weake foundation euer sit
for on a sandie hill that still did flit
and fall away it mounted was full hie
that euery breath of heauen shaked it
and all the hinder parts that few could spie
were ruinous and old but painted cunningly


arriued there they passed in forth right
for still to all the gates stood open wide
yet charge of them was to a porter hight
cald maluenú who entrance none denide
thence to the hall which was on euery side
with rich array and costly arras dight
infinite sorts of people did abide
there waiting long to win the wished sight
of her that was the lady of that pallace bright


by them they passe all gazing on them round
and to the presence mount whose glorious vew
their frayle amazed senses did confound
in liuing princes court none euer knew
such endlesse richesse and so sumptuous shew
ne persia selfe the nourse of pompous pride
like euer saw and there a noble crew
of lordes and ladies stood on euery side
which with their presence faire the place much beautifide


high aboue all a cloth of state was spred
and a rich throne as bright as sunny day
on which there sate most braue embellished
with royall robes and gorgeous array
a mayden queene that shone as titans ray
in glistring gold and peerelesse pretious stone
yet her bright blazing beautie did assay
to dim the brightnesse of her glorious throne
as enuying her selfe that too exceeding shone


exceeding shone like phoebus fairest childe
that did presume his fathers firie wayne
and flaming mouthes of steedes vnwonted wilde
through highest heauen with weaker hand to rayne
proud of such glory and aduancement vaine
while flashing beames do daze his feeble eyen
he leaues the welkin way most beaten plaine
and rapt with whirling wheeles inflames the skyen
with fire not made to burne but fairely for to shyne


so proud she shyned in her princely state
looking to heauen for earth she did disdayne
and sitting high for lowly she did hate
lo vnderneath her scornefull feete was layne
a dreadfull dragon with an hideous trayne
and in her hand she held a mirrhour bright
wherein her face she often vewed fayne
and in her selfeloud semblance tooke delight
for she was wondrous faire as any liuing wight


of griesly pluto she the daughter was
and sad proserpina the queene of hell
yet did she thinke her pearelesse wroth to pas
that parentage with pride so did she swell
and thundring ioue that high in heauen doth dwell
and wield the world she claymed for her syre
or if that any else did ioue excell
for to the highest she did still aspyre
or if ought higher were then that did it desyre


and proud lucifera men did her call
that made her selfe a queene and crownd to be
yet rightfull kingdome she had none at all
ne heritage of natiue soueraintie
but did vsurpe with wrong and tyrannie
vpon the scepter which she now did hold
ne ruld her realmes with lawes but pollicie
and strong aduizement of six wisards old
that with their counsels bad her kingdome did vphold


soone as the elfing knight in presence came
and false duessa seeming lady faire
a gentle husher vanitie by name
made rowme and passage for them did prepaire
so goodly brought them to the lowest staire
of her high throne where they on humble knee
making obeyssance did the cause declare
why they were come her royall state to see
to proue the wide report of her great maiestee


with loftie eyes halfe loth to looke so low
she thanked them in her disdainefull wise
ne other grace vouchsafed them to show
of princesse worthy scarse them bad arise
her lordes and ladies all this while deuise
themselues to setten forth to straungers sight
some frounce their curled haire in courtly guise
some prancke their ruffes and others trimly dight
their gay attire each others greater pride does spight


goodly they all that knight do entertaine
right glad with him to haue increast their crew
but to duess each one himselfe did paine
all kindnesse and faire courtesie to shew
for in that court whylome her well they knew
yet the stout faerie mongst the middest crowd
thought all their glorie vaine in knightly vew
and that great princesse too exceeding prowd
that to strange knight no better countenance allowd


suddein vpriseth from her stately place
the royall dame and for her coche doth call
all hurtlen forth and she with princely pace
as faire aurora in her purple pall
out of the east the dawning day doth call
so forth she comes her brightnesse brode doth blaze
the heapes of people thronging in the hall
do ride each other vpon her to gaze
her glorious glitterand light doth all mens eyes amaze


so forth she comes and to her coche does clyme
adorned all with gold and girlonds gay
that seemd as fresh as flora in her prime
and stroue to match in royall rich array
great iunoes golden chaire the which they say
the gods stand gazing on when she does ride
to ioues high house through heauens braspaued way
drawne of faire pecocks that excell in pride
and full of argus eyes their tailes dispredden wide


but this was drawne of six vnequall beasts
on which her six sage counsellours did ryde
taught to obay their bestiall beheasts
with like conditions to their kinds applyde
of which the first that all the rest did guyde
was sluggish idlenesse the nourse of sin
vpon a slouthfull asse he chose to ryde
arayd in habit blacke and amis thin
like to an holy monck the seruice to begin


and in his hand his portesse still he bare
that much was worne but therein little red
for of deuotion he had little care
still drownd in sleepe and most of his dayes ded
scarse could he once vphold his heauie hed
to looken whether it were night or day
may seeme the wayne was very euill led
when such an one had guiding of the way
that knew not whether right he went or else astray


from worldy cares himselfe he did esloyne
and greatly shunned manly exercise
from euery worke he chalenged essoyne
for contemplation sake yet otherwise
his life he led in lawlesse riotise
by which he grew to grieuous malady
for in his lustlesse limbs through euill guise
a shaking feuer raignd continually
such one was idlenesse first of this company


and by his side rode loathsome gluttony
deformed creature on a filthie swyne
his belly was vpblowne with luxury
and eke with fatnesse swollen were his eyne
and like a crane his necke was long and fyne
with which he swallowd vp excessiue feast
for want whereof poore people oft did pyne
and all the way most like a brutish beast
he spued vp his gorge that all did him deteast


in greene vine leaues he was right fitly clad
for other clothes he could not weare for heat
and on his head an yuie girland had
from vnder which fast trickled downe the sweat
still as he rode he somewhat still did eat
and in his hand did beare a bouzing can
of which he supt so oft that on his seat
his dronken corse he scarse vpholden can
in shape and life more like a monster then a man


vnfit he was for any worldy thing
and eke vnhable once to stirre or go
not meet to be of counsell to a king
whose mind in meat and drinke was drowned so
that from his friend he seldome knew his fo
full of diseases was his carcas blew
and a dry dropsie through his flesh did flow
which by misdiet daily greater grew
such one was gluttony the second of that crew


and next to him rode lustfull lechery
vpon a bearded goat whose rugged haire
and whally eyes the signe of gelosy
was like the person selfe whom he did beare
who rough and blacke and filthy did appeare
vnseemely man to please faire ladies eye
yet he of ladies oft was loued deare
when fairer faces were bid standen by
o who does know the bent of womens fantasy


in a greene gowne he clothed was full faire
which vnderneath did hide his filthinesse
and in his hand a burning hart he bare
full of vaine follies and new fanglenesse
for he was false and fraught with ficklenesse
and learned had to loue with secret lookes
and well could daunce and sing with ruefulnesse
and fortunes tell and read in louing bookes
and thousand other wayes to bait his fleshly hookes


inconstant man that loued all he saw
and lusted after all that he did loue
ne would his looser life be tide to law
but ioyd weake wemens hearts to tempt and proue
if from their loyall loues he might then moue
which lewdnesse fild him with reprochfull paine
of that fowle euill which all men reproue
that rots the marrow and consumes the braine
such one was lecherie the third of all this traine


and greedy auarice by him did ride
vpon a camell loaden all with gold
two iron coffers hong on either side
with precious mettall full as they might hold
and in his lap an heape of coine he told
for of his wicked pelfe his god he made
and vnto hell him selfe for money sold
accursed vsurie was all his trade
and right and wrong ylike in equall ballaunce waide


his life was nigh vnto deaths doore yplast
and thredbare cote and cobled shoes he ware
ne scarse good morsell all his life did tast
but both from backe and belly still did spare
to fill his bags and richesse to compare
yet chylde ne kinsman liuing had he none
to leaue them to but thorough daily care
to get and nightly feare to lose his owne
he led a wretched life vnto him selfe vnknowne


most wretched wight whom nothing might suffise
whose greedy lust did lacke in greatest store
whose need had end but no end couetise
whose wealth was want whose plẽty made him pore
who had enough yet wished euer more
a vile disease and eke in foote and hand
a grieuous gout tormented him full sore
that well he could not touch nor go nor stand
such one was auarice the fourth of this faire band


and next to him malicious enuie rode
vpon a rauenous wolfe and still did chaw
betweene his cankred teeth a venemous tode
that all the poison ran about his chaw
but inwardly he chawed his owne maw
at neighbours wealth that made him euer sad
for death it was when any good he saw
and wept that cause of weeping none he had
but when he heard of harme he wexed wondrous glad


all in a kirtle of discolourd say
he clothed was ypainted full of eyes
and in his bosome secretly there lay
an hatefull snake the which his taile vptyes
in many folds and mortall sting implyes
still as he rode he gnasht his teeth to see
those heapes of gold with griple couetyse
and grudged at the great felicitie
of proud lucifera and his owne companie


he hated all good workes and vertuous deeds
and him no lesse that any like did vse
and who with gracious bread the hungry feeds
his almes for want of faith he doth accuse
so euery good to bad he doth abuse
and eke the verse of famous poets witt
he does backebite and spightfull poison spues
from leprous mouth on all that euer writt
such one vile enuie was that fift in row did sitt


and him beside rides fierce reuenging vvrath
vpon a lion loth for to be led
and in his hand a burning brond he hath
the which he brandisheth about his hed
his eyes did hurle forth sparkles fiery red
and stared sterne on all that him beheld
as ashes pale of hew and seeming ded
and on his dagger still his hand he held
trembling through hasty rage whẽ choler in him sweld


his ruffin raiment all was staind with blood
which he had spilt and all to rags yrent
through vnaduized rashnesse woxen wood
for of his hands he had no gouernement
ne card for bloud in his auengement
but when the furious fit was ouerpast
his cruell facts he often would repent
yet wilfull man he neuer would forecast
how many mischieues should ensue his heedlesse hast


full many mischiefes follow cruell vvrath
abhorred bloudshed and tumultuous strife
vnmanly murder and vnthrifty scath
bitter despight with rancours rusty knife
and fretting griefe the enemy of life
all these and many euils moe haunt ire
the swelling splene and frenzy raging rife
the shaking palsey and saint fraunces fire
such one was vvrath the last of this vngodly tire


and after all vpon the wagon beame
rode sathan with a smarting whip in hand
with which he forward lasht the laesie teme
so oft as slowth still in the mire did stand
huge routs of people did about them band
showting for ioy and still before their way
a foggy mist had couered all the land
and vnderneath their feet all scattered lay
dead sculs bones of men whose life had gone astray


so forth they marchen in this goodly sort
to take the solace of the open aire
and in fresh flowring fields themselues to sport
emongst the rest rode that false lady faire
the fowle duessa next vnto the chaire
of proud lucifer as one of the traine
but that good knight would not so nigh repaire
him selfe estraunging from their ioyaunce vaine
whose fellowship seemd far vnfit for warlike swaine


so hauing solaced themselues a space
with pleasaunce of the breathing fields yfed
they backe returned to the princely place
whereas an errant knight in armes ycled
and heathnish shield wherein with letters red
was writ sans ioy they new arriued find
enflamd with fury and fiers hardyhed
he seemd in hart to harbour thoughts vnkind
and nourish bloudy vengeaunce in his bitter mind


who when the shamed shield of slaine sans foy
he spide with that same faery champions page
bewraying him that did of late destroy
his eldest brother burning all with rage
he to him leapt and that same enuious gage
of victors glory from him snatcht away
but thelfin knight which ought that warlike wage
disdaind to loose the meed he wonne in fray
and him rencountring fierce reskewd the noble pray


therewith they gan to hurtlen greedily
redoubted battaile ready to darrayne
and clash their shields and shake their swords on hy
that with their sturre they troubled all the traine
till that great queene vpon eternall paine
of high displeasure that ensewen might
commaunded them their fury to refraine
and if that either to that shield had right
in equall lists they should the morrow next it fight


ah dearest dame quoth then the paynim bold
pardon the errour of enraged wight
whom great griefe made forget the raines to hold
of reasons rule to see this recreant knight
no knight but treachour full of false despight
and shamefull treason who through guile hath slayn
the prowest knight that euer field did fight
euen stout sans foy o who can then refrayn
whose shield he beares renuerst the more to heape disdayn


and to augment the glorie of his guile
his dearest loue the faire fidessa loe
is there possessed of the traytour vile
who reapes the haruest sowen by his foe
sowen in bloudy field and bought with woe
that brothers hand shall dearely well requight
so be ô queene you equall fauour showe
him litle answerd thangry elfin knight
he neuer meant with words but swords to plead his right


but threw his gauntlet as a sacred pledge
his cause in combat the next day to try
so been they parted both with harts on edge
to be auengd each on his enimy
that night they pas in ioy and iollity
feasting and courting both in bowre and hall
for steward was excessiue gluttonie
that of his plenty poured forth to all
which doen the chamberlain slowth did to rest them call


now whenas darkesome night had all displayd
her coleblacke curtein ouer brightest skye
the warlike youthes on dayntie couches layd
did chace away sweet sleepe from sluggish eye
to muse on meanes of hoped victory
but whenas morpheus had with leaden mace
arrested all that courtly company
vprose duessa from her resting place
and to the paynims lodging comes with silent pace


whom broad awake she finds in troublous fit
forecasting how his foe he might annoy
and him amoues with speaches seeming fit
ah deare sans ioy next dearest to sans foy
cause of my new griefe cause of my new ioy
ioyous to see his ymage in mine eye
and greeud to thinke how foe did him destroy
that was the flowre of grace and cheualrye
lo his fidessa to thy secret faith i flye


with gentle wordes he can her fairely greet
and bad say on the secret of her hart
then sighing soft i learne that litle sweet
oft tempred is quoth she with muchell smart
for since my brest was launcht with louely dart
of deare sansfoy i neuer ioyed howre
but in eternall woes my weaker hart
haue wasted louing him with all my powre
and for his sake haue felt full many an heauie stowre


at last when perils all i weened past
and hopd to reape the crop of all my care
into new woes vnweeting i was cast
by this false faytor who vnworthy ware
his worthy shield whom he with guilefull snare
entrapped slew and brought to shamefull graue
me silly maid away with him he bare
and euer since hath kept in darksome caue
for that i would not yeeld that to sansfoy i gaue


but since faire sunne hath sperst that lowring clowd
and to my loathed life now shewes some light
vnder your beames i will me safely shrowd
from dreaded storme of his disdainfull spight
to you thinheritance belongs by right
of brothers prayse to you eke longs his loue
let not his loue let not his restlesse spright
be vnreuengd that calles to you aboue
from wandring stygian shores where it doth endlesse moue


thereto said he faire dame be nought dismaid
for sorrowes past their griefe is with them gone
ne yet of present perill be affraid
for needlesse feare did neuer vantage none
and helplesse hap it booteth not to mone
dead is sansfoy his vitall paines are past
though greeued ghost for vengeance deepe do grone
he liues that shall him pay his dewties last
and guiltie elfin bloud shall sacrifice in hast


o but i feare the fickle freakes quoth shee
of fortune false and oddes of armes in field
why dame quoth he what oddes can euer bee
where both do fight alike to win or yield
yea but quoth she he beares a charmed shield
and eke enchaunted armes that none can perce
ne none can wound the man that does them wield
charmd or enchaunted answerd he then ferce
i no whit reck ne you the like need to reherce


but faire fidessa sithens fortunes guile
or enimies powre hath now captiued you
returne from whence ye came and rest a while
till morrow next that i the elfe subdew
and with sansfoyes dead dowry you endew
ay me that is a double death she said
with proud foes sight my sorrow to renew
where euer yet i be my secrete aid
shall follow you so passing forth she him obaid


the faithfull knight in equall field
subdewes his faithlesse foe
whom false duessa saues and for
his cure to hell does goe


the noble hart that harbours vertuous thought
and is with child of glorious great intent
can neuer rest vntill it forth haue brought
theternall brood of glorie excellent
such restlesse passion did all night torment
the flaming corage of that faery knight
deuizing how that doughtie turnament
with greatest honour he atchieuen might


still did he wake and still did watch for dawning light
at last the golden orientall gate
of greatest heauen gan to open faire
and phoebus fresh as bridegrome to his mate
came dauncing forth shaking his deawie haire
and hurld his glistring beames through gloomy aire
which when the wakeful elfe perceiud streight way
he started vp and did him selfe prepaire
in sunbright armes and battailous array
for with that pagan proud he combat will that day


and forth he comes into the commune hall
where earely waite him many a gazing eye
to weet what end to straunger knights may fall
there many minstrales maken melody
to driue away the dull melancholy
and many bardes that to the trembling chord
can tune their timely voyces cunningly
and many chroniclers that can record
old loues and warres for ladies doen by many a lord


soone after comes the cruell sarazin
in wouen maile all armed warily
and sternly lookes at him who not a pin
does care for looke of liuing creatures eye
they bring them wines of greece and araby
and daintie spices fetcht from furthest ynd
to kindle heat of corage priuily
and in the wine a solemne oth they bynd
tobserue the sacred lawes of armes that are assynd


at last forth comes that far renowmed queene
with royall pomp and princely maiestie
she is ybrought vnto a paled greene
and placed vnder stately canapee
the warlike feates of both those knights to see
on thother side in all mens open vew
duessa placed is and on a tree
sansfoy his shield is hangd with bloudy hew
both those the lawrell girlonds to the victor dew


a shrilling trompet sownded from on hye
and vnto battaill bad them selues addresse
their shining shieldes about their wrestes they tye
and burning blades about their heads do blesse
the instruments of wrath and heauinesse
with greedy force each other doth assayle
and strike so fiercely that they do impresse
deepe dinted furrowes in the battred mayle
the yron walles to ward their blowes are weake fraile


the sarazin was stout and wondrous strong
and heaped blowes like yron hammers great
for after bloud and vengeance he did long
the knight was fiers and full of youthly heat
and doubled strokes like dreaded thunders threat
for all for prayse and honour he did fight
both stricken strike and beaten both do beat
that from their shields forth flyeth firie light
and helmets hewen deepe shew marks of eithers might


so thone for wrong the other striues for right
as when a gryfon seized of his pray
a dragon fiers encountreth in his flight
through widest ayre making his ydle way
that would his rightfull rauine rend away
with hideous horrour both together smight
and souce so sore that they the heauens affray
the wise southsayer seeing so sad sight
thamazed vulgar tels of warres and mortall fight


so thone for wrong the other striues for right
and each to deadly shame would driue his foe
the cruell steele so greedily doth bight
in tender flesh that streames of bloud down flow
with which the armes that earst so bright did show
into a pure vermillion now are dyde
great ruth in all the gazers harts did grow
seeing the gored woundes to gape so wyde
that victory they dare not wish to either side


at last the paynim chaunst to cast his eye
his suddein eye flaming with wrathfull fyre
vpon his brothers shield which hong thereby
therewith redoubled was his raging yre
and said ah wretched sonne of wofull syre
doest thou sit wayling by black stygian lake
whilest here thy shield is hangd for victors hyre
and sluggish german doest thy forces slake
to aftersend his foe that him may ouertake


goe caytiue elfe him quickly ouertake
and soone redeeme from his long wandring woe
goe guiltie ghost to him my message make
that i his shield haue quit from dying foe
therewith vpon his crest he stroke him so
that twise he reeled readie twise to fall
end of the doubtfull battell deemed tho
the lookers on and lowd to him gan call
the false duessa thine the shield and i and all


soone as the faerie heard his ladie speake
out of his swowning dreame he gan awake
and quickning faith that earst was woxen weake
the creeping deadly cold away did shake
tho moud with wrath and shame and ladies sake
of all attonce he cast auengd to bee
and with soexceeding furie at him strake
that forced him to stoupe vpon his knee
had he not stouped so he should haue clouen bee


and to him said goe now proud miscreant
thy selfe thy message doe to german deare
alone he wandring thee too long doth want
goe say his foe thy shield with his doth beare
therewith his heauie hand he high gan reare
him to haue slaine when loe a darkesome clowd
vpon him fell he no where doth appeare
but vanisht is the elfe him cals alowd
but answer none receiues the darknes him does shrowd


in haste duessa from her place arose
and to him running said o prowest knight
that euer ladie to her loue did chose
let now abate the terror of your might
and quench the flame of furious despight
and bloudie vengeance lo thinfernall powres
couering your foe with cloud of deadly night
haue borne him hence to plutoes balefull bowres
the conquest yours i yours the shield and glory yours


not all so satisfide with greedie eye
he sought all round about his thirstie blade
to bath in bloud of faithlesse enemy
who all that while lay hid in secret shade
he standes amazed how he thence should fade
at last the trumpets triumph sound on hie
and running heralds humble homage made
greeting him goodly with new victorie
and to him brought the shield the cause of enmitie


wherewith he goeth to that soueraine queene
and falling her before on lowly knee
to her makes present of his seruice seene
which she accepts with thankes and goodly gree
greatly aduauncing his gay cheualree
so marcheth home and by her takes the knight
whom all the people follow with great glee
shouting and clapping all their hands on hight
that all the aire it fils and flyes to heauen bright


home is he brought and laid in sumptuous bed
where many skilfull leaches him abide
to salue his hurts that yet still freshly bled
in wine and oyle they wash his woundes wide
and softly can embalme on euery side
and all the while most heauenly melody
about the bed sweet musicke did diuide
him to beguile of griefe and agony
and all the while duessa wept full bitterly


as when a wearie traueller that strayes
by muddy shore of broad seuenmouthed nile
vnweeting of the perillous wandring wayes
doth meet a cruell craftie crocodile
which in false griefe hyding his harmefull guile
doth weepe full sore and sheddeth tender teares
the foolish man that pitties all this while
his mournefull plight is swallowd vp vnwares
forgetfull of his owne that mindes anothers cares


so wept duessa vntill euentide
that shyning lampes in ioues high house were light
then forth she rose ne lenger would abide
but comes vnto the place where thhethen knight
in slombring swownd nigh voyd of vitall spright
lay couerd with inchaunted cloud all day
whom when she found as she him left in plight
to wayle his woefull case she would not stay
but to the easterne coast of heauen makes speedy way


where griesly night with visage deadly sad
that phoebus chearefull face durst neuer vew
and in a foule blacke pitchie mantle clad
she findes forth comming from her darkesome mew
where she all day did hide her hated hew
before the dore her yron charet stood
alreadie harnessed for iourney new
and coleblacke steedes yborne of hellish brood
that on their rustie bits did champ as they were wood


who when she saw duessa sunny bright
adornd with gold and iewels shining cleare
she greatly grew amazed at the sight
and thvnacquainted light began to feare
for neuer did such brightnesse there appeare
and would haue backe retyred to her caue
vntill the witches speech she gan to heare
saying yet ô thou dreaded dame i craue
abide till i haue told the message which i haue


she stayd and foorth duessa gan proceede
o thou most auncient grandmother of all
more old then ioue whom thou at first didst breede
or that great house of gods cælestiall
which wast begot in dæmogorgons hall
and sawst the secrets of the world vnmade
why suffredst thou thy nephewes deare to fall
with elfin sword most shamefully betrade
lo where the stout sansioy doth sleepe in deadly shade


and him before i saw with bitter eyes
the bold sansfoy shrinke vnderneath his speare
and now the pray of fowles in field he lyes
nor wayld of friends nor laid on groning beare
that whylome was to me too dearely deare
o what of gods then boots it to be borne
if old aveugles sonnes so euill heare
or who shall not great nightes children scorne
when two of three her nephews are so fowle forlorne


vp then vp dreary dame of darknesse queene
go gather vp the reliques of thy race
or else goe them auenge and let be seene
that dreaded night in brightest day hath place
and can the children of faire light deface
her feeling speeches some compassion moued
in hart and chaunge in that great mothers face
yet pittie in her hart was neuer proued
till then for euermore she hated neuer loued


and said deare daughter rightly may i rew
the fall of famous children borne of mee
and good successes which their foes ensew
but who can turne the streame of destinee
or breake the chayne of strong necessitee
which fast is tyde to ioues eternall seat
the sonnes of day he fauoureth i see
and by my ruines thinkes to make them great
to make one great by others losse is bad excheat


yet shall they not escape so freely all
for some shall pay the price of others guilt
and he the man that made sansfoy to fall
shall with his owne bloud price that he hath spilt
but what art thou that telst of nephews kilt
i that do seeme not i duessa am
quoth she how euer now in garments gilt
and gorgeous gold arayd i to thee came
duessa i the daughter of deceipt and shame


then bowing downe her aged backe she kist
the wicked witch saying in that faire face
the false resemblance of deceipt i wist
did closely lurke yet so trueseeming grace
it carried that i scarse in darkesome place
could it discerne though i the mother bee
of falshood and root of duessaes race
o welcome child whom i haue longd to see
and how haue seene vnwares lo now i go with thee


then to her yron wagon she betakes
and with her beares the fowle welfauourd witch
through mirkesome aire her readie way she makes
her twyfold teme of which two blacke as pitch
and two were browne yet each to each vnlich
did softly swim away ne euer stampe
vnlesse she chaunst their stubborne mouths to twitch
then foming tarre their bridles they would champe
and trampling the fine element would fiercely rampe


so well they sped that they be come at length
vnto the place whereas the paynim lay
deuoid of outward sense and natiue strength
couerd with charmed cloud from vew of day
and sight of men since his late luckelesse fray
his cruell wounds with cruddy bloud congealed
they binden vp so wisely as they may
and handle softly till they can be healed
so lay him in her charet close in night concealed


and all the while she stood vpon the ground
the wakefull dogs did neuer cease to bay
as giuing warning of thvnwonted sound
with which her yron wheeles did them affray
and her darke griesly looke them much dismay
the messenger of death the ghastly owle
with drearie shriekes did also her bewray
and hungry wolues continually did howle
at her abhorred face so filthy and so fowle


thence turning backe in silence soft they stole
and brought the heauie corse with easie pace
to yawning gulfe of deepe auernus hole
by that same hole an entrance darke and bace
with smoake and sulphure hiding all the place
descends to hell there creature neuer past
that backe returned without heauenly grace
but dreadfull furies which their chaines haue brast
and damned sprights sent forth to make ill men aghast


by that same way the direfull dames doe driue
their mournefull charet fild with rusty blood
and downe to plutoes house are come biliue
which passing through on euery side them stood
the trembling ghosts with sad amazed mood
chattring their yron teeth and staring wide
with stonie eyes and all the hellish brood
of feends infernall flockt on euery side
to gaze on earthly wight that with the night durst ride


they pas the bitter waues of acheron
where many soules sit wailing woefully
and come to fiery flood of phlegeton
whereas the damned ghosts in torments fry
and with sharpe shrilling shriekes doe bootlesse cry
cursing high ioue the which them thither sent
the house of endlesse paine is built thereby
in which ten thousand sorts of punishment
the cursed creatures doe eternally torment


before the threshold dreadfull cerberus
his three deformed heads did lay along
curled with thousand adders venemous
and lilled forth his bloudie flaming tong
at them he gan to reare his bristles strong
and felly gnarre vntill dayes enemy
did him appease then downe his taile he hong
and suffered them to passen quietly
for she in hell and heauen had power equally


there was ixion turned on a wheele
for daring tempt the queene of heauen to sin
and sisyphus an huge round stone did reele
against an hill ne might from labour lin
there thirstie tantalus hong by the chin
and tityus fed a vulture on his maw
typhoeus ioynts were stretched on a gin
theseus condemned to endlesse slouth by law
and fifty sisters water in leake vessels draw


they all beholding worldly wights in place
leaue off their worke vnmindfull of their smart
to gaze on them who forth by them doe pace
till they be come vnto the furthest part
where was a caue ywrought by wondrous art
deepe darke vneasie dolefull comfortlesse
in which sad æsculapius farre a part
emprisond was in chaines remedilesse
for that hippolytus rent corse he did redresse


hippolytus a iolly huntsman was
that wont in charet chace the foming bore
he all his peeres in beautie did surpas
but ladies loue as losse of time forbore
his wanton stepdame loued him the more
but when she saw her offred sweets refused
her loue she turnd to hate and him before
his father fierce of treason false accused
and with her gealous termes his open eares abused


who all in rage his seagod syre besought
some cursed vengeance on his sonne to cast
from surging gulf two monsters straight were brought
with dread whereof his chasing steedes aghast
both charet swift and huntsman ouercast
his goodly corps on ragged cliffs yrent
was quite dismembred and his members chast
scattered on euery mountaine as he went
that of hippolytus was left no moniment


his cruell stepdame seeing what was donne
her wicked dayes with wretched knife did end
in death auowing thinnocence of her sonne
which hearing his rash syre began to rend
his haire and hastie tongue that did offend
tho gathering vp the relicks of his smart
by dianes meanes who was hippolyts frend
them brought to æsculape that by his art
did heale them all againe and ioyned euery part


such wondrous science in mans wit to raine
when ioue auizd that could the dead reuiue
and fates expired could renew againe
of endlesse life he might him not depriue
but vnto hell did thrust him downe aliue
with flashing thunderbolt ywounded sore
where long remaining he did alwaies striue
himselfe wilth salues to health for to restore
and slake the heauenly fire that raged euermore


there auncient night arriuing did alight
from her nigh wearie waine and in her armes
to æsculapius brought the wounded knight
whom hauing softly disarayd of armes
tho gan to him discouer all his harmes
beseeching him with prayer and with praise
if either salues or oyles or herbes or charmes
a fordonne wight from dore of death mote raise
he would at her request prolong her nephews daies


ah dame quoth he thou temptest me in vaine
to dare the thing which daily yet i rew
and the old cause of my continued paine
with like attempt to like end to renew
is not enough that thrust from heauen dew
here endlesse penance for one fault i pay
but that redoubled crime with vengeance new
thou biddest me to eeke can night defray
the wrath of thundring ioue that rules both night and day


not so quoth she but sith that heauens king
from hope of heauen hath thee excluded quight
why fearest thou that canst not hope for thing
and fearest not that more thee hurten might
now in the powre of euerlasting night
goe to then ô thou farre renowmed sonne
of great apollo shew thy famous might
in medicine that else hath to thee wonne
great paines greater praise both neuer to be donne


her words preuaild and then the learned leach
his cunning hand gan to his wounds to lay
and all things else the which his art did teach
which hauing seene from thence arose away
the mother of dread darknesse and let stay
aueugles sonne there in the leaches cure
and backe returning tooke her wonted way
to runne her timely race whilst phoebus pure
in westerne waues his wearie wagon did recure


the false duessa leauing noyous night
returnd to stately pallace of dame pride
where when she came she found the faery knight
departed thence albe his woundes wide
not throughly heald vnreadie were to ride
good cause he had to hasten thence away
for on a day his wary dwarfe had spide
where in a dongeon deepe huge numbers lay
of caytiue wretched thrals that wayled night and day


a ruefull sight as could be seene with eie
of whom he learned had in secret wise
the hidden cause of their captiuitie
how mortgaging their liues to couetise
through wastfull pride and wanton riotise
they were by law of that proud tyrannesse
prouokt with vvrath and enuies false surmise
condemned to that dongeon mercilesse
where they should liue in woe die in wretchednesse


there was that great proud king of babylon
that would compell all nations to adore
and him as onely god to call vpon
till through celestiall doome throwne out of dore
into an oxe he was transformd of yore
there also was king croesus that enhaunst
his heart too high through his great riches store
and proud antiochus the which aduaunst
his cursed hand gainst god and on his altars daunst


and them long time before great nimrod was
that first the world with sword and fire warrayd
and after him old ninus farre did pas
in princely pompe of all the world obayd
there also was that mightie monarch layd
low vnder all yet aboue all in pride
that name of natiue syre did fowle vpbrayd
and would as ammons sonne be magnifide
till scornd of god and man a shamefull death he dide


all these together in one heape were throwne
like carkases of beasts in butchers stall
and in another corner wide were strowne
the antique ruines of the romaines fall
great romulus the grandsyre of them all
proud tarquin and too lordly lentulus
stout scipio and stubborne hanniball
ambitious sylla and sterne marius
high cæsar great pompey and fierce antonius


amongst these mighty men were wemen mixt
proud wemen vaine forgetfull of their yoke
the bold semiramis whose sides transfixt
with sonnes owne blade her fowle reproches spoke
faire sthenoboea that her selfe did choke
with wilfull cord for wanting of her will
high minded cleopatra that with stroke
of aspes sting her selfe did stoutly kill
and thousands moe the like that did that dongeon fill


besides the endlesse routs of wretched thralles
which thither were assembled day by day
from all the world after their wofull falles
through wicked pride and wasted wealthes decay
but most of all which in the dongeon lay
fell from high princes courts or ladies bowres
where they in idle pompe or wanton play
consumed had their goods and thriftlesse howres
and lastly throwne themselues into these heauy stowres


whose case when as the carefull dwarfe had tould
and made ensample of their mournefull sight
vnto his maister he no lenger would
there dwell in perill of like painefull plight
but early rose and ere that dawning light
discouered had the world to heauen wyde
he by a priuie posterne tooke his flight
that of no enuious eyes he mote be spyde
for doubtlesse death ensewd if any him descryde


scarse could he footing find in that fowle way
for many corses like a great laystall
of murdred men which therein strowed lay
without remorse or decent funerall
which all through that great princesse pride did fall
and came to shamefull end and them beside
forth ryding vnderneath the castell wall
a donghill of dead carkases he spide
the dreadfull spectacle of that sad house of pride




from lawlesse lust by wondrous grace
fayre vna is releast
whom saluage nation does adore
and learnes her wise beheast


as when a ship that flyes faire vnder saile
an hidden rocke escaped hath vnwares
that lay in waite her wrack for to bewaile
the marriner yet halfe amazed stares
at perill past and yet in doubt ne dares
to ioy at his foolehappie ouersight
so doubly is distrest twixt ioy and cares
the dreadlesse courage of this elfin knight
hauing escapt so sad ensamples in his sight


yet sad he was that his too hastie speed
the faire duess had forst him leaue behind
and yet more sad that vna his deare dreed
her truth had staind with treason so vnkind
yet crime in her could neuer creature find
but for his loue and for her owne selfe sake
she wandred had from one to other ynd
him for to seeke ne euer would forsake
till her vnwares the fierce sansloy did ouertake


who after archimagoes fowle defeat
led her away into a forrest wilde
and turning wrathfull fire to lustfull heat
with beastly sin thought her to haue defilde
and made the vassall of his pleasures vilde
yet first he cast by treatie and by traynes
her to perswade that stubborne fort to yilde
for greater conquest of hard loue he gaynes
that workes it to his will then he that it constraines


with fawning wordes he courted her a while
and looking louely and oft sighing sore
her constant hart did tempt with diuerse guile
but wordes and lookes and sighes she did abhore
as rocke of diamond stedfast euermore
yet for to feed his fyrie lustfull eye
he snatcht the vele that hong her face before
then gan her beautie shine as brightest skye
and burnt his beastly hart tefforce her chastitye


so when he saw his flattring arts to fayle
and subtile engines bet from batteree
with greedy force he gan the fort assayle
whereof he weend possessed soone to bee
and win rich spoile of ransackt chastetee
ah heauens that do this hideous act behold
and heauenly virgin thus outraged see
how can ye vengeance iust so long withhold
and hurle not flashing flames vpon that paynim bold


the pitteous maiden carefull comfortlesse
does throw out thrilling shriekes shrieking cryes
the last vaine helpe of womens great distresse
and with loud plaints importuneth the skyes
that molten starres do drop like weeping eyes
and phoebus flying so most shamefull sight
his blushing face in foggy cloud implyes
and hides for shame what wit of mortall wight
can now deuise to quit a thrall from such a plight


eternall prouidence exceeding thought
where none appeares can make her selfe a way
a wondrous way it for this lady wrought
from lyons clawes to pluck the griped pray
her shrill outcryes and shriekes so loud did bray
that all the woodes and forestes did resownd
a troupe of faunes and satyres far away
within the wood were dauncing in a rownd
whiles old syluanus slept in shady arber sownd


who when they heard that pitteous strained voice
in hast forsooke their rurall meriment
and ran towards the far rebownded noyce
to weet what wight so loudly did lament
vnto the place they come incontinent
whom when the raging sarazin espide
a rude misshapen monstrous rablement
whose like he neuer saw he durst not bide
but got his ready steed and fast away gan ride


the wyld woodgods arriued in the place
there find the virgin dolefull desolate
with ruffled rayments and faire blubbred face
as her outrageous foe had left her late
and trembling yet through feare of former hate
all stand amazed at so vncouth sight
and gin to pittie her vnhappie state
all stand astonied at her beautie bright
in their rude eyes vnworthie of so wofull plight


she more amazd in double dread doth dwell
and euery tender part for feare does shake
as when a greedie wolfe through hunger fell
a seely lambe farre from the flocke does take
of whom he meanes his bloudie feast to make
a lyon spyes fast running towards him
the innocent pray in hast he does forsake
which quit from death yet quakes in euery lim
with chaunge of feare to see the lyon looke so grim


such fearefull fit assaid her trembling hart
ne word to speake ne ioynt to moue she had
the saluage nation feele her secret smart
and read her sorrow in her countnance sad
their frowning forheads with rough hornes yclad
and rusticke horror all a side doe lay
and gently grenning shew a semblance glad
to comfort her and feare to put away
their backward bent knees teach her humbly to obay


the doubtfull damzell dare not yet commit
her single person to their barbarous truth
but still twixt feare and hope amazd does sit
late learnd what harme to hastie trust ensuth
they in compassion of her tender youth
and wonder of her beautie soueraine
are wonne with pitty and vnwonted ruth
and all prostrate vpon the lowly plaine
do kisse her feete and fawne on her with countnance faine


their harts she ghesseth by their humble guise
and yieldes her to extremitie of time
so from the ground she fearelesse doth arise
and walketh forth without suspect of crime
they all as glad as birdes of ioyous prime
thence lead her forth about her dauncing round
shouting and singing all a shepheards ryme
and with greene braunches strowing all the ground
do worship her as queene with oliue girlond cround


and all the way their merry pipes they sound
that all the woods with doubled eccho ring
and with their horned feet do weare the ground
leaping like wanton kids in pleasant spring
so towards old syluanus they her bring
who with the noyse awaked commeth out
to weet the cause his weake steps gouerning
and aged limbs on cypresse stadle stout
and with an yuie twyne his wast is girt about


far off he wonders what them makes so glad
if bacchus merry fruit they did inuent
or cybeles franticke rites haue made them mad
they drawing nigh vnto their god present
that flowre of faith and beautie excellent
the god himselfe vewing that mirrhour rare
stood long amazd and burnt in his intent
his owne faire dryope now he thinkes not faire
and pholoe fowle when her to this he doth compaire


the woodborne people fall before her flat
and worship her as goddesse of the wood
and old syluanus selfe bethinkes not what
to thinke of wight so faire but gazing stood
in doubt to deeme her borne of earthly brood
sometimes dame venus selfe he seemes to see
but venus neuer had so sober mood
sometimes diana he her takes to bee
but misseth bow and shaftes and buskins to her knee


by vew of her he ginneth to reuiue
his ancient loue and dearest cyparisse
and calles to mind his pourtraiture aliue
how faire he was and yet not faire to this
and how he slew with glauncing dart amisse
a gentle hynd the which the louely boy
did loue as life aboue all worldly blisse
for griefe whereof the lad nould after ioy
but pynd away in anguish and selfewild annoy


the wooddy nymphes faire hamadryades
her to behold do thither runne apace
and all the troupe of lightfoot naiades
flocke all about to see her louely face
but when they vewed haue her heauenly grace
they enuie her in their malitious mind
and fly away for feare of fowle disgrace
but all the satyres scorne their woody kind
and henceforth nothing faire but her on earth they find


glad of such lucke the luckelesse lucky maid
did her content to please their feeble eyes
and long time with that saluage people staid
to gather breath in many miseries
during which time her gentle wit she plyes
to teach them truth which worshipt her in vaine
and made her thimage of idolatryes
but when their bootlesse zeale she did restraine
frõ her own worship they her asse would worship fayn


it fortuned a noble warlike knight
by iust occasion to that forrest came
to seeke his kindred and the lignage right
from whence he tooke his well deserued name
he had in armes abroad wonne muchell fame
and fild far landes with glorie of his might
plaine faithfull true and enimy of shame
and euer loud to fight for ladies right
but in vaine glorious frayes he litle did delight


a satyres sonne yborne in forrest wyld
by straunge aduenture as it did betyde
and there begotten of a lady myld
faire thyamis the daughter of labryde
that was in sacred bands of wedlocke tyde
to therion a loose vnruly swayne
who had more ioy to raunge the forrest wyde
and chase the saluage beast with busie payne
then serue his ladies loue and wast in pleasures vayne


the forlorne mayd did with loues longing burne
and could not lacke her louers company
but to the wood she goes to serue her turne
and seeke her spouse that from her still does fly
and followes other game and venery
a satyre chaunst her wandring for to find
and kindling coles of lust in brutish eye
the loyall links of wedlocke did vnbind
and made her person thrall vnto his beastly kind


so long in secret cabin there he held
her captiue to his sensuall desire
till that with timely fruit her belly sweld
and bore a boy vnto that saluage sire
then home he suffred her for to retire
for ransome leauing him the late borne childe
whom till to ryper yeares he gan aspire
he noursled vp in life and manners wilde
emongst wild beasts and woods from lawes of men exilde


for all he taught the tender ymp was but
to banish cowardize and bastard feare
his trembling hand he would him force to put
vpon the lyon and the rugged beare
and from the she beares teats her whelps to teare
and eke wyld roring buls he would him make
to tame and ryde their backes not made to beare
and the robuckes in flight to ouertake
that euery beast for feare of him did fly and quake


thereby so fearelesse and so fell he grew
that his owne sire and maister of his guise
did often tremble at his horrid vew
and oft for dread of hurt would him aduise
the angry beasts not rashly to despise
nor too much to prouoke for he would learne
the lyon stoup to him in lowly wise
a lesson hard and make the libbard sterne
leaue roaring when in rage he for reuenge did earne


and for to make his powre approued more
wyld beasts in yron yokes he would compell
the spotted panther and the tusked bore
the pardale swift and the tigre cruell
the antelope and wolfe both fierce and fell
and them constraine in equall teme to draw
such ioy he had their stubborne harts to quell
and sturdie courage tame with dreadfull aw
that his beheast they feared as tyrans law


his louing mother came vpon a day
vnto the woods to see her little sonne
and chaunst vnwares to meet him in the way
after his sportes and cruell pastime donne
when after him a lyonesse did runne
that roaring all with rage did lowd requere
her children deare whom he away had wonne
the lyon whelpes she saw how he did beare
and lull in rugged armes withouten childish feare


the fearefull dame all quaked at the sight
and turning backe gan fast to fly away
vntill with loue reuokt from vaine affright
she hardly yet perswaded was to stay
and then to him these womanish words gan say
ah satyrane my dearling and my ioy
for loue of me leaue off this dreadfull play
to dally thus with death is no fit toy
go find some other playfellowes mine own sweet boy


in these and like delights of bloudy game
he trayned was till ryper yeares he raught
and there abode whilst any beast of name
walkt in that forest whom he had not taught
to feare his force and then his courage haught
desird of forreine foemen to be knowne
and far abroad for straunge aduentures sought
in which his might was neuer ouerthrowne
but through all faery lond his famous worth was blown


yet euermore it was his manner faire
after long labours and aduentures spent
vnto those natiue woods for to repaire
to see his sire and offspring auncient
and now he thither came for like intent
where he vnwares the fairest vna found
straunge lady in so straunge habiliment
teaching the satyres which her sat around
trew sacred lore which from her sweet lips did redound


he wondred at her wisedome heauenly rare
whose like in womens wit he neuer knew
and when her curteous deeds he did compare
gan her admire and her sad sorrowes rew
blaming of fortune which such troubles threw
and ioyd to make proofe of her crueltie
on gentle dame so hurtlesse and so trew
thenceforth he kept her goodly company
and learnd her discipline of faith and veritie


but she all vowd vnto the redcrosse knight
his wandring perill closely did lament
ne in this new acquaintaunce could delight
but her deare heart with anguish did torment
and all her wit in secret counsels spent
how to escape at last in priuie wise
to satyrane she shewed her intent
who glad to gain such fauour gan deuise
how with that pensiue maid he best might thence arise


so on a day when satyres all were gone
to do their seruice to syluanus old
the gentle virgin left behind alone
he led away with courage stout and bold
too late it was to satyres to be told
or euer hope recouer her againe
in vaine he seekes that hauing cannot hold
so fast he carried her with carefull paine
that they the woods are past come now to the plaine


the better part now of the lingring day
they traueild had when as they farre espide
a wearie wight forwandring by the way
and towards him they gan in hast to ride
to weet of newes that did abroad betide
or tydings of her knight of the redcrosse
but he them spying gan to turne aside
for feare as seemd or for some feigned losse
more greedy they of newes fast towards him do crosse


a silly man in simple weedes forworne
and soild with dust of the long dried way
his sandales were with toilesome trauell torne
and face all tand with scorching sunny ray
as he had traueild many a sommers day
through boyling sands of arabie and ynde
and in his hand a iacobs staffe to stay
his wearie limbes vpon and eke behind
his scrip did hang in which his needments he did bind


the knight approching nigh of him inquerd
tydings of warre and of aduentures new
but warres nor new aduentures none he herd
then vna gan to aske if ought he knew
or heard abroad of that her champion trew
that in his armour bare a croslet red
aye me deare dame quoth he well may i rew
to tell the sad sight which mine eies haue red
these eyes did see that knight both liuing and eke ded


that cruell word her tender hart so thrild
that suddein cold did runne through euery vaine
and stony horrour all her sences fild
with dying fit that downe she fell for paine
the knight her lightly reared vp againe
and comforted with curteous kind reliefe
then wonne from death she bad him tellen plaine
the further processe of her hidden griefe
the lesser pangs can beare who hath endurd the chiefe


then gan the pilgrim thus i chaunst this day
this fatall day that shall i euer rew
to see two knights in trauell on my way
a sory sight arraungd in battell new
both breathing vengeaunce both of wrathfull hew
my fearefull flesh did tremble at their strife
to see their blades so greedily imbrew
that drunke with bloud yet thristed after life
what more the redcrosse knight was slaine with paynim knife


ah dearest lord quoth she how might that bee
and he the stoutest knight that euer wonne
ah dearest dame quoth he how might i see
the thing that might not be and yet was donne
where is said satyrane that paynims sonne
that him of life and vs of ioy hath reft
not far away quoth he he hence doth wonne
foreby a fountaine where i late him left
washing his bloudy wounds that through the steele were cleft


therewith the knight thence marched forth in hast
whiles vna with huge heauinesse opprest
could not for sorrow follow him so fast
and soone he came as he the place had ghest
whereas that pagan proud him selfe did rest
in secret shadow by a fountaine side
euen he it was that earst would haue supprest
faire vna whom when satyrane espide
with fowle reprochfull words he boldly him defide


and said arise thou cursed miscreaunt
that hast with knightlesse guile and trecherous train
faire knighthood fowly shamed and doest vaunt
that good knight of the redcrosse to haue slain
arise and with like treason now maintain
thy guilty wrong or else thee guilty yield
the sarazin this hearing rose amain
and catching vp in hast his three square shield
and shining helmet soone him buckled to the field


and drawing nigh him said ah misborne elfe
in euill houre thy foes thee hither sent
anothers wrongs to wreake vpon thy selfe
yet ill thou blamest me for hauing blent
my name with guile and traiterous intent
that redcrosse knight perdie i neuer slew
but had he beene where earst his armes were lent
thenchaunter vaine his errour should not rew
but thou his errour shalt i hope now prouen trew


therewith they gan both furious and fell
to thunder blowes and fiersly to assaile
each other bent his enimy to quell
that with their force they perst both plate and maile
and made wide furrowes in their fleshes fraile
that it would pitty any liuing eie
large floods of bloud adowne their sides did raile
but floods of bloud could not them satisfie
both hungred after death both chose to win or die


so long they fight and fell reuenge pursue
that fainting each themselues to breathen let
and oft refreshed battell oft renue
as when two bores with rancling malice met
their gory sides fresh bleeding fiercely fret
til breathlesse both them selues aside retire
where foming wrath their cruell tuskes they whet
and trample thearth the whiles they may respire
then backe to fight againe new breathed and entire


so fiersly when these knights had breathed once
they gan to fight returne increasing more
their puissant force and cruell rage attonce
with heaped strokes more hugely then before
that with their drerie wounds and bloudy gore
they both deformed scarsely could be known
by this sad vna fraught with anguish sore
led with their noise which through the aire was thrown
arriud where they in erth their fruitles bloud had sown


whom all so soone as that proud sarazin
espide he gan reuiue the memory
of his lewd lusts and late attempted sin
and left the doubtfull battell hastily
to catch her newly offred to his eie
but satyrane with strokes him turning staid
and sternely bad him other businesse plie
then hunt the steps of pure vnspotted maid
wherewith he all enragd these bitter speaches said


o foolish faeries sonne what furie mad
hath thee incenst to hast thy dolefull fate
were it not better i that lady had
then that thou hadst repented it too late
most sencelesse man he that himselfe doth hate
to loue another lo then for thine ayd
here take thy louers token on thy pate
so they to fight the whiles the royall mayd
fled farre away of that proud paynim sore afrayd


but that false pilgrim which that leasing told
being in deed old archimage did stay
in secret shadow all this to behold
and much reioyced in their bloudy fray
but when he saw the damsell passe away
he left his stond and her pursewd apace
in hope to bring her to her last decay
but for to tell her lamentable cace
and eke this battels end will need another place


the redcrosse knight is captiue made
by gyaunt proud opprest
prince arthur meets with vna great
ly with those newes distrest


what man so wise what earthly wit so ware
as to descry the crafty cunning traine
by which deceipt doth maske in visour faire
and cast her colours dyed deepe in graine
to seeme like truth whose shape she well can faine
and fitting gestures to her purpose frame
the guiltlesse man with guile to entertaine


great maistresse of her art was that false dame
the false duessa cloked with fidessaes name
who when returning from the drery night
she fownd not in that perilous house of pryde
where she had left the noble redcrosse knight
her hoped pray she would no lenger bide
but forth she went to seeke him far and wide
ere long she fownd whereas he wearie sate
to rest him selfe foreby a fountaine side
disarmed all of yroncoted plate
and by his side his steed the grassy forage ate


he feedes vpon the cooling shade and bayes
his sweatie forehead in the breathing wind
which through the trẽbling leaues full gently playes
wherein the cherefull birds of sundry kind
do chaunt sweet musick to delight his mind
the witch approching gan him fairely greet
and with reproch of carelesnesse vnkind
vpbrayd for leauing her in place vnmeet
with fowle words tempring faire soure gall with hony sweet


vnkindnesse past they gan of solace treat
and bathe in pleasaunce of the ioyous shade
which shielded them against the boyling heat
and with greene boughes decking a gloomy glade
about the fountaine like a girlond made
whose bubbling waue did euer freshly well
ne euer would through feruent sommer fade
the sacred nymph which therein wont to dwell
was out of dianes fauour as it then befell


the cause was this one day when phoebe fayre
with all her band was following the chace
this nymph quite tyrd with heat of scorching ayre
sat downe to rest in middest of the race
the goddesse wroth gan fowly her disgrace
and bad the waters which from her did flow
be such as she her selfe was then in place
thenceforth her waters waxed dull and slow
and all that drunke thereof did faint and feeble grow


hereof this gentle knight vnweeting was
and lying downe vpon the sandie graile
drunke of the streame as cleare as cristall glas
eftsoones his manly forces gan to faile
and mightie strong was turnd to feeble fraile
his chaunged powres at first them selues not felt
till crudled cold his corage gan assaile
and chearefull bloud in faintnesse chill did melt
which like a feuer fit through all his body swelt


yet goodly court he made still to his dame
pourd out in loosnesse on the grassy grownd
both carelesse of his health and of his fame
till at the last he heard a dreadfull sownd
which through the wood loud bellowing did rebownd
that all the earth for terrour seemd to shake
and trees did tremble thelfe therewith astownd
vpstarted lightly from his looser make
and his vnready weapons gan in hand to take


but ere he could his armour on him dight
or get his shield his monstrous enimy
with sturdie steps came stalking in his sight
an hideous geant horrible and hye
that with his talnesse seemd to threat the skye
the ground eke groned vnder him for dreed
his liuing like saw neuer liuing eye
ne durst behold his stature did exceed
the hight of three the tallest sonnes of mortall seed


the greatest earth his vncouth mother was
and blustring aeolus his boasted sire
who with his breath which through the world doth pas
her hollow womb did secretly inspire
and fild her hidden caues with stormie yre
that she conceiud and trebling the dew time
in which the wombes of women do expire
brought forth this monstrous masse of earthly slime
puft vp with emptie wind and fild with sinfull crime


so growen great through arrogant delight
of thhigh descent whereof he was yborne
and through presumption of his matchlesse might
all other powres and knighthood he did scorne
such now he marcheth to this man forlorne
and left to losse his stalking steps are stayde
vpon a snaggy oke which he had torne
out of his mothers bowelles and it made
his mortall mace wherewith his foemen he dismayde


that when the knight he spide he gan aduance
with huge force and insupportable mayne
and towardes him with dreadfull fury praunce
who haplesse and eke hopelesse all in vaine
did to him pace sad battaile to darrayne
disarmd disgrast and inwardly dismayde
and eke so faint in euery ioynt and vaine
through that fraile fountaine which him feeble made
that scarsely could he weeld his bootlesse single blade


the geaunt strooke so maynly mercilesse
that could haue ouerthrowne a stony towre
and were not heauenly grace that him did blesse
he had beene pouldred all as thin as flowre
but he was wary of that deadly stowre
and lightly lept from vnderneath the blow
yet so exceeding was the villeins powre
that with the wind it did him ouerthrow
and all his sences stound that still he lay full low


as when that diuelish yron engin wrought
in deepest hell and framd by furies skill
with windy nitre and quick sulphur fraught
and ramd with bullet round ordaind to kill
conceiueth fire the heauens it doth fill
with thundring noyse and all the ayre doth choke
that none can breath nor see nor heare at will
through smouldry cloud of duskish stincking smoke
that thonely breath him daunts who hath escapt the stroke


so daunted when the geaunt saw the knight
his heauie hand he heaued vp on hye
and him to dust thought to haue battred quight
vntill duessa loud to him gan crye
o great orgoglio greatest vnder skye
o hold thy mortall hand for ladies sake
hold for my sake and do him not to dye
but vanquisht thine eternall bondslaue make
and me thy worthy meed vnto thy leman take


he hearkned and did stay from further harmes
to gayne so goodly guerdon as she spake
so willingly she came into his armes
who her as willingly to grace did take
and was possessed of his new found make
then vp he tooke the slombred sencelesse corse
and ere he could out of his swowne awake
him to his castle brought with hastie forse
and in a dongeon deepe him threw without remorse


from that day forth duessa was his deare
and highly honourd in his haughtie eye
he gaue her gold and purple pall to weare
and triple crowne set on her head full hye
and her endowd with royall maiestye
then for to make her dreaded more of men
and peoples harts with awfull terrour tye
a monstrous beast ybred in filthy fen
he chose which he had kept long time in darksome den


such one it was as that renowmed snake
which great alcides in stremona slew
long fostred in the filth of lerna lake
whose many heads out budding euer new
did breed him endlesse labour to subdew
but this same monster much more vgly was
for seuen great heads out of his body grew
an yron brest and backe of scaly bras
and all embrewd in bloud his eyes did shine as glas


his tayle was stretched out in wondrous length
that to the house of heauenly gods it raught
and with extorted powre and borrowd strength
the euerburning lamps from thence it braught
and prowdly threw to ground as things of naught
and vnderneath his filthy feet did tread
the sacred things and holy heasts foretaught
vpon this dreadfull beast with seuenfold head
he set the false duessa for more aw and dread


the wofull dwarfe which saw his maisters fall
whiles he had keeping of his grasing steed
and valiant knight become a caytiue thrall
when all was past tooke vp his forlorne weed
his mightie armour missing most at need
his siluer shield now idle maisterlesse
his poynant speare that many made to bleed
the ruefull moniments of heauinesse
and with them all departes to tell his great distresse


he had not trauaild long when on the way
he wofull ladie wofull vna met
fast flying from the paynims greedy pray
whilest satyrane him from pursuit did let
who when her eyes she on the dwarf had set
and saw the signes that deadly tydings spake
she fell to ground for sorrowfull regret
and liuely breath her sad brest did forsake
yet might her pitteous hart be seene to pant and quake


the messenger of so vnhappie newes
would faine haue dyde dead was his hart within
yet outwardly some little comfort shewes
at last recouering hart he does begin
to rub her temples and to chaufe her chin
and euery tender part does tosse and turne
so hardly he the flitted life does win
vnto her natiue prison to retourne
then gins her grieued ghost thus to lament and mourne


ye dreary instruments of dolefull sight
that doe this deadly spectacle behold
why do ye lenger feed on loathed light
or liking find to gaze on earthly mould
sith cruell fates the carefull threeds vnfould
the which my life and loue together tyde
now let the stony dart of senselesse cold
perce to my hart and pas through euery side
and let eternall night so sad sight fro me hide


o lightsome day the lampe of highest ioue
first made by him mens wandring wayes to guyde
when darknesse he in deepest dongeon droue
henceforth thy hated face for euer hyde
and shut vp heauens windowes shyning wyde
for earthly sight can nought but sorow breed
and late repentance which shall long abyde
mine eyes no more on vanitie shall feed
but seeled vp with death shall haue their deadly meed


then downe againe she fell vnto the ground
but he her quickly reared vp againe
thrise did she sinke adowne in deadly swownd
and thrise he her reviud with busie paine
at last when life recouerd had the raine
and ouerwrestled his strong enemie
with foltring tong and trembling euery vaine
tell on quoth she the wofull tragedie
the which these reliques sad present vnto mine eie


tempestuous fortune hath spent all her spight
and thrilling sorrow throwne his vtmost dart
thy sad tongue cannot tell more heauy plight
then that i feele and harbour in mine hart
who hath endurd the whole can beare each part
if death it be it is not the first wound
that launched hath my brest with bleeding smart
begin and end the bitter balefull stound
if lesse then that i feare more fauour i haue found


then gan the dwarfe the whole discourse declare
the subtill traines of archimago old
the wanton loues of false fidessa faire
bought with the bloud of vanquisht paynim bold
the wretched payre transformd to treen mould
the house of pride and perils round about
the combat which he with sansioy did hould
the lucklesse conflict with the gyant stout
wherein captiud of life or death he stood in doubt


she heard with patience all vnto the end
and stroue to maister sorrowfull assay
which greater grew the more she did contend
and almost rent her tender hart in tway
and loue fresh coles vnto her fire did lay
for greater loue the greater is the losse
was neuer ladie loued dearer day
then she did loue the knight of the redcrosse
for whose deare sake so many troubles her did tosse


at last when feruent sorrow slaked was
she vp arose resoluing him to find
a liue or dead and forward forth doth pas
all as the dwarfe the way to her assynd
and euermore in constant carefull mind
she fed her wound with fresh renewed bale
long tost with stormes and bet with bitter wind
high ouer hils and low adowne the dale
she wandred many a wood and measurd many a vale


at last she chaunced by good hap to meet
a goodly knight faire marching by the way
together with his squire arayed meet
his glitterand armour shined farre away
like glauncing light of phoebus brightest ray
from top to toe no place appeared bare
that deadly dint of steele endanger may
athwart his brest a bauldrick braue he ware
that shynd like twinkling stars with stons most pretious rare


and in the midst thereof one pretious stone
of wondrous worth and eke of wondrous mights
shapt like a ladies head exceeding shone
like hesperus emongst the lesser lights
and stroue for to amaze the weaker sights
thereby his mortall blade full comely hong
in yuory sheath ycarud with curious slights
whose hilts were burnisht gold and handle strong
of mother pearle and buckled with a golden tong


his haughtie helmet horrid all with gold
both glorious brightnesse and great terrour bred
for all the crest a dragon did enfold
with greedie pawes and ouer all did spred
his golden wings his dreadfull hideous hed
close couched on the beuer seemd to throw
from flaming mouth bright sparkles fierie red
that suddeine horror to faint harts did show
and scaly tayle was stretcht adowne his backe full low


vpon the top of all his loftie crest
a bunch of haires discolourd diuersly
with sprincled pearle and gold full richly drest
did shake and seemd to daunce for iollity
like to an almond tree ymounted hye
on top of greene selinis all alone
with blossomes braue bedecked daintily
whose tender locks do tremble euery one
at euery little breath that vnder heauen is blowne


his warlike shield all closely couerd was
ne might of mortall eye be euer seene
not made of steele nor of enduring bras
such earthly mettals soone consumed bene
but all of diamond perfect pure and cleene
it framed was one massie entire mould
hewen out of adamant rocke with engines keene
that point of speare it neuer percen could
ne dint of direfull sword diuide the substance would


the same to wight he neuer wont disclose
but when as monsters huge he would dismay
or daunt vnequall armies of his foes
or when the flying heauens he would affray
for so exceeding shone his glistring ray
that phoebus golden face it did attaint
as when a cloud his beames doth ouerlay
and siluer cynthia wexed pale and faint
as when her face is staynd with magicke arts constraint


no magicke arts hereof had any might
nor bloudie wordes of bold enchaunters call
but all that was not such as seemd in sight
before that shield did fade and suddeine fall
and when him list the raskall routes appall
men into stones therewith he could transmew
and stones to dust and dust to nought at all
and when him list the prouder lookes subdew
he would them gazing blind or turne to other hew


ne let it seeme that credence this exceedes
for he that made the same was knowne right well
to haue done much more admirable deedes
it merlin was which whylome did excell
all liuing wightes in might of magicke spell
both shield and sword and armour all he wrought
for this young prince when first to armes he fell
but when he dyde the faerie queene it brought
to faerie lond where yet it may be seene if sought


a gentle youth his dearely loued squire
his speare of heben wood behind him bare
whose harmefull head thrice heated in the fire
had riuen many a brest with pikehead square
a goodly person and could menage faire
his stubborne steed with curbed canon bit
who vnder him did trample as the aire
and chauft that any on his backe should sit
the yron rowels into frothy fome he bit


when as this knight nigh to the ladie drew
with louely court he gan her entertaine
but when he heard her answeres loth he knew
some secret sorrow did her heart distraine
which to allay and calme her storming paine
faire feeling words he wisely gan display
and for her humour fitting purpose faine
to tempt the cause it selfe for to bewray
wherewith emmoud these bleeding words she gan to say


what worlds delight or ioy of liuing speach
can heart so plungd in sea of sorrowes deepe
and heaped with so huge misfortunes reach
the carefull cold beginneth for to creepe
and in my heart his yron arrow steepe
soone as i thinke vpon my bitter bale
such helplesse harmes yts better hidden keepe
then rip vp griefe where it may not auaile
my last left comfort is my woes to weepe and waile


ah ladie deare quoth then the gentle knight
well may i weene your griefe is wondrous great
for wondrous great griefe groneth in my spright
whiles thus i heare you of your sorrowes treat
but wofull ladie let me you intrete
for to vnfold the anguish of your hart
mishaps are maistred by aduice discrete
and counsell mittigates the greatest smart
found neuer helpe who neuer would his hurts impart


o but quoth she great griefe will not be tould
and can more easily be thought then said
right so quoth he but he that neuer would
could neuer will to might giues greatest aid
but griefe quoth she does greater grow displaid
if then it find not helpe and breedes despaire
despaire breedes not quoth he where faith is staid
no faith so fast quoth she but flesh does paire
flesh may empaire quoth he but reason can repaire


his goodly reason and well guided speach
so deepe did settle in her gratious thought
that her perswaded to disclose the breach
which loue and fortune in her heart had wrought
and said faire sir i hope good hap hath brought
you to inquere the secrets of my griefe
or that your wisedome will direct my thought
or that your prowesse can me yield reliefe
then heare the storie sad which i shall tell you briefe


the forlorne maiden whom your eyes haue seene
the laughing stocke of fortunes mockeries
am thonly daughter of a king and queene
whose parents deare whilest equall destinies
did runne about and their felicities
the fauourable heauens did not enuy
did spread their rule through all the territories
which phison and euphrates floweth by
and gehons golden waues doe wash continually


till that their cruell cursed enemy
an huge great dragon horrible in sight
bred in the loathly lakes of tartary
with murdrous rauine and deuouring might
their kingdome spoild and countrey wasted quight
themselues for feare into his iawes to fall
he forst to castle strong to take their flight
where fast embard in mightie brasen wall
he has them now foure yeres besiegd to make thẽ thrall


full many knights aduenturous and stout
haue enterprizd that monster to subdew
from euery coast that heauen walks about
haue thither come the noble martiall crew
that famous hard atchieuements still pursew
yet neuer any could that girlond win
but all still shronke and still he greater grew
all they for want of faith or guilt of sin
the pitteous pray of his fierce crueltie haue bin


at last yledd with farre reported praise
which flying fame throughout the world had spred
of doughtie knights whom faery land did raise
that noble order hight of maidenhed
forthwith to court of gloriane i sped
of gloriane great queene of glory bright
whose kingdomes seat cleopolis is red
there to obtaine some such redoubted knight
that parents deare from tyrants powre deliuer might


it was my chance my chance was faire and good
there for to find a fresh vnproued knight
whose manly hands imbrewd in guiltie blood
had neuer bene ne euer by his might
had throwne to ground the vnregarded right
yet of his prowesse proofe he since hath made
i witnesse am in many a cruell fight
the groning ghosts of many one dismaide
haue felt the bitter dint of his auenging blade


and ye the forlorne reliques of his powre
his byting sword and his deuouring speare
which haue endured many a dreadfull stowre
can speake his prowesse that did earst you beare
and well could rule now he hath left you heare
to be the record of his ruefull losse
and of my dolefull disauenturous deare
o heauie record of the good redcrosse
where haue you left your lord that could so well you tosse


well hoped i and faire beginnings had
that he my captiue langour should redeeme
till all vnweeting an enchaunter bad
his sence abusd and made him to misdeeme
my loyalty not such as it did seeme
that rather death desire then such despight
be iudge ye heauens that all things right esteeme
how i him loud and loue with all my might
so thought i eke of him and thinke i thought aright


thenceforth me desolate he quite forsooke
to wander where wilde fortune would me lead
and other bywaies he himselfe betooke
where neuer foot of liuing wight did tread
that brought not backe the balefull body dead
in which him chaunced false duessa meete
mine onely foe mine onely deadly dread
who with her witchcraft and misseeming sweete
inueigled him to follow her desires vnmeete


at last by subtill sleights she him betraid
vnto his foe a gyant huge and tall
who him disarmed dissolute dismaid
vnwares surprised and with mightie mall
the monster mercilesse him made to fall
whose fall did neuer foe before behold
and now in darkesome dungeon wretched thrall
remedilesse for aie he doth him hold
this is my cause of griefe more great then may be told


ere she had ended all she gan to faint
but he her comforted and faire bespake
certes madame ye haue great cause of plaint
that stoutest heart i weene could cause to quake
but be of cheare and comfort to you take
for till i haue acquit your captiue knight
assure your selfe i will you not forsake
his chearefull words reuiud her chearelesse spright
so forth they went the dwarfe them guiding euer right


faire virgin to redeeme her deare
brings arthur to the fight
who slayes the gyant wounds the beast
and strips duessa quight


ay me how many perils doe enfold
the righteous man to make him daily fall
were not that heauenly grace doth him vphold
and stedfast truth acquite him out of all
her loue is firme her care continuall
so oft as he through his owne foolish pride
or weaknesse is to sinfull bands made thrall
else should this redcrosse knight in bands haue dyde
for whose deliuerãce she this prince doth thither guide


they sadly traueild thus vntill they came
nigh to a castle builded strong and hie
then cryde the dwarfe lo yonder is the same
in which my lord my liege doth lucklesse lie
thrall to that gyants hatefull tyrannie
therefore deare sir your mightie powres assay
the noble knight alighted by and by
from loftie steede and bad the ladie stay
to see what end of fight should him befall that day


so with the squire thadmirer of his might
he marched forth towards that castle wall
whose gates he found fast shut ne liuing wight
to ward the same nor answere commers call
then tooke that squire an horne of bugle small
which hong adowne his side in twisted gold
and tassels gay wyde wonders ouer all
of that same hornes great vertues weren told
which had approued bene in vses manifold


was neuer wight that heard that shrilling sound
but trembling feare did feele in euery vaine
three miles it might be easie heard around
and ecchoes three answerd it selfe againe
no false enchauntment nor deceiptfull traine
might once abide the terror of that blast
but presently was voide and wholly vaine
no gate so strong no locke so firme and fast
but with that percing noise flew open quite or brast


the same before the geants gate he blew
that all the castle quaked from the ground
and euery dore of freewill open flew
the gyant selfe dismaied with that sownd
where he with his duessa dalliance fownd
in hast came rushing forth from inner bowre
with staring countenance sterne as one astownd
and staggering steps to weet what suddein stowre
had wrought that horror strange and dard his dreaded powre


and after him the proud duessa came
high mounted on her manyheaded beast
and euery head with fyrie tongue did flame
and euery head was crowned on his creast
and bloudie mouthed with late cruell feast
that when the knight beheld his mightie shild
vpon his manly arme he soone addrest
and at him fiercely flew with courage fild
and eger greedinesse through euery member thrild


therewith the gyant buckled him to fight
inflamd with scornefull wrath and high disdaine
and lifting vp his dreadfull club on hight
all armd with ragged snubbes and knottie graine
him thought at first encounter to haue slaine
but wise and warie was that noble pere
and lightly leaping from so monstrous maine
did faire auoide the violence him nere
it booted nought to thinke such thunderbolts to beare


ne shame he thought to shunne so hideous might
the idle stroke enforcing furious way
missing the marke of his misaymed sight
did fall to ground and with his heauie sway
so deepely dinted in the driuen clay
that three yardes deepe a furrow vp did throw
the sad earth wounded with so sore assay
did grone full grieuous vnderneath the blow
and trembling with strange feare did like an earthquake show


as when almightie ioue in wrathfull mood
to wreake the guilt of mortall sins is bent
hurles forth his thundring dart with deadly food
enrold in flames and smouldring dreriment
through riuen cloudes and molten firmament
the fierce threeforked engin making way
both loftie towres and highest trees hath rent
and all that might his angrie passage stay
and shooting in the earth casts vp a mount of clay


his boystrous club so buried in the ground
he could not rearen vp againe so light
but that the knight him at auantage found
and whiles he stroue his combred clubbe to quight
out of the earth with blade all burning bright
he smote off his left arme which like a blocke
did fall to ground depriud of natiue might
large streames of bloud out of the truncked stocke
forth gushed like fresh water streame from riuen rocke


dismaied with so desperate deadly wound
and eke impatient of vnwonted paine
he loudly brayd with beastly yelling sound
that all the fields rebellowed againe
as great a noyse as when in cymbrian plaine
an heard of bulles whom kindly rage doth sting
do for the milkie mothers want complaine
and fill the fields with troublous bellowing
the neighbour woods around with hollow murmur ring


that when his deare duessa heard and saw
the euill stownd that daungerd her estate
vnto his aide she hastily did draw
her dreadfull beast who swolne with bloud of late
came ramping forth with proud presumpteous gate
and threatned all his heads like flaming brands
but him the squire made quickly to retrate
encountring fierce with single sword in hand
and twixt him and his lord did like a bulwarke stand


the proud duessa full of wrathfull spight
and fierce disdaine to be affronted so
enforst her purple beast with all her might
that stop out of the way to ouerthroe
scorning the let of so vnequall foe
but nathemore would that courageous swayne
to her yeeld passage gainst his lord to goe
but with outrageous strokes did him restraine
and with his bodie bard the way atwixt them twaine


then tooke the angrie witch her golden cup
which still she bore replete with magick artes
death and despeyre did many thereof sup
and secret poyson through their inner parts
theternall bale of heauie wounded harts
which after charmes and some enchauntments said
she lightly sprinkled on his weaker parts
therewith his sturdie courage soone was quayd
and all his senses were with suddeine dread dismayd


so downe he fell before the cruell beast
who on his necke his bloudie clawes did seize
that life nigh crusht out of his panting brest
no powre he had to stirre nor will to rize
that when the carefull knight gan well auise
he lightly left the foe with whom he fought
and to the beast gan turne his enterprise
for wondrous anguish in his hart it wrought
to see his loued squire into such thraldome brought


and high aduauncing his bloudthirstie blade
stroke one of those deformed heads so sore
that of his puissance proud ensample made
his monstrous scalpe downe to his teeth it tore
and that misformed shape misshaped more
a sea of bloud gusht from the gaping wound
that her gay garments staynd with filthy gore
and ouerflowed all the field around
that ouer shoes in bloud he waded on the ground


thereat he roared for exceeding paine
that to haue heard great horror would haue bred
and scourging themptie ayre with his long traine
through great impatience of his grieued hed
his gorgeous ryder from her loftie sted
would haue cast downe and trod in durtie myre
had not the gyant soone her succoured
who all enragd with smart and franticke yre
came hurtling in full fierce and forst the knight retyre


the force which wont in two to be disperst
in one alone left hand he now vnites
which is through rage more strong then both were erst
with which his hideous club aloft he dites
and at his foe with furious rigour smites
that strongest oake might seeme to ouerthrow
the stroke vpon his shield so heauie lites
that to the ground it doubleth him full low
what mortall wight could euer beare so monstrous blow


and in his fall his shield that couered was
did loose his vele by chaunce and open flew
the light whereof that heauens light did pas
such blazing brightnesse through the aier threw
that eye mote not the same endure to vew
which when the gyaunt spyde with staring eye
he downe let fall his arme and soft withdrew
his weapon huge that heaued was on hye
for to haue slaine the man that on the ground did lye


and eke the fruitfullheaded beast amazd
at flashing beames of that sunshiny shield
became starke blind and all his senses dazd
that downe he tumbled on the durtie field
and seemd himselfe as conquered to yield
whom when his maistresse proud perceiud to fall
whiles yet his feeble feet for faintnesse reeld
vnto the gyant loudly she gan call
o helpe orgoglio helpe or else we perish all


at her so pitteous cry was much amooud
her champion stout and for to ayde his frend
againe his wonted angry weapon prooud
but all in vaine for he has read his end
in that bright shield and all their forces spend
themselues in vaine for since that glauncing sight
he hath no powre to hurt nor to defend
as where thalmighties lightning brond does light
it dimmes the dazed eyen and daunts the senses quight


whom when the prince to battell new addrest
and threatning high his dreadfull stroke did see
his sparkling blade about his head he blest
and smote off quite his right leg by the knee
that downe he tombled as an aged tree
high growing on the top of rocky clift
whose hartstrings with keene steele nigh hewen be
the mightie trunck halfe rent with ragged rift
doth roll adowne the rocks and fall with fearefull drift


or as a castle reared high and round
by subtile engins and malitious slight
is vndermined from the lowest ground
and her foundation forst and feebled quight
at last downe falles and with her heaped hight
her hastie ruine does more heauie make
and yields it selfe vnto the victours might
such was this gyaunts fall that seemd to shake
the stedfast globe of earth as it for feare did quake


the knight then lightly leaping to the pray
with mortall steele him smot againe so sore
that headlesse his vnweldy bodie lay
all wallowd in his owne fowle bloudy gore
which flowed from his wounds in wondrous store
but soone as breath out of his breast did pas
that huge great body which the gyaunt bore
was vanisht quite and of that monstrous mas
was nothing left but like an emptie bladder was


whose grieuous fall when false duessa spide
her golden cup she cast vnto the ground
and crowned mitre rudely threw aside
such percing griefe her stubborne hart did wound
that she could not endure that dolefull stound
but leauing all behind her fled away
the lightfoot squire her quickly turnd around
and by hard meanes enforcing her to stay
so brought vnto his lord as his deserued pray


the royall virgin which beheld from farre
in pensiue plight and sad perplexitie
the whole atchieuement of this doubtfull warre
came running fast to greet his victorie
with sober gladnesse and myld modestie
and with sweet ioyous cheare him thus bespake
faire braunch of noblesse flowre of cheualrie
that with your worth the world amazed make
how shall i quite the paines ye suffer for my sake


and you fresh bud of vertue springing fast
whom these sad eyes saw nigh vnto deaths dore
what hath poore virgin for such perill past
wherewith you to reward accept therefore
my simple selfe and seruice euermore
and he that high does sit and all things see
with equall eyes their merites to restore
behold what ye this day haue done for mee
and what i cannot quite requite with vsuree


but sith the heauens and your faire handeling
haue made you maister of the field this day
your fortune maister eke with gouerning
and well begun end all so well i pray
ne let that wicked woman scape away
for she it is that did my lord bethrall
my dearest lord and deepe in dongeon lay
where he his better dayes hath wasted all
o heare how piteous he to you for ayd does call


forthwith he gaue in charge vnto his squire
that scarlot whore to keepen carefully
whiles he himselfe with greedie great desire
into the castle entred forcibly
where liuing creature none he did espye
then gan he lowdly through the house to call
but no man card to answere to his crye
there raignd a solemne silence ouer all
nor voice was heard nor wight was seene in bowre or hall


at last with creeping crooked pace forth came
an old old man with beard as white as snow
that on a staffe his feeble steps did frame
and guide his wearie gate both too and fro
for his eye sight him failed long ygo
and on his arme a bounch of keyes he bore
the which vnused rust did ouergrow
those were the keyes of euery inner dore
but he could not them vse but kept them still in store


but very vncouth sight was to behold
how he did fashion his vntoward pace
for as he forward mooud his footing old
so backward still was turnd his wrincled face
vnlike to men who euer as they trace
both feet and face one way are wont to lead
this was the auncient keeper of that place
and foster father of the gyant dead
his name ignaro did his nature right aread


his reuerend haires and holy grauitie
the knight much honord as beseemed well
and gently askt where all the people bee
which in that stately building wont to dwell
who answerd him full soft he could not tell
againe he askt where that same knight was layd
whom great orgoglio with his puissaunce fell
had made his caytiue thrall againe he sayde
he could not tell ne euer other answere made


then asked he which way he in might pas
he could not tell againe he answered
thereat the curteous knight displeased was
and said old sire it seemes thou hast not red
how ill it sits with that same siluer hed
in vaine to mocke or mockt in vaine to bee
but if thou be as thou art pourtrahed
with natures pen in ages graue degree
aread in grauer wise what i demaund of thee


his answere likewise was he could not tell
whose senceless speach and doted ignorance
when as the noble prince had marked well
he ghest his nature by his countenance
and calmd his wrath with goodly temperance
then to him stepping from his arme did reach
those keyes and made himselfe free enterance
each dore he opened without any breach
there was no barre to stop nor foe him to empeach


there all within full rich arayd he found
with royall arras and resplendent gold
and did with store of euery thing abound
that greatest princes presence might behold
but all the floore too filthy to be told
with bloud of guiltlesse babes and innocents trew
which there were slaine as sheepe out of the fold
defiled was that dreadfull was to vew
and sacred ashes ouer it was strowed new


and there beside of marble stone was built
an altare carud with cunning imagery
on which true christians bloud was often spilt
and holy martyrs often doen to dye
with cruell malice and strong tyranny
whose blessed sprites from vnderneath the stone
to god for vengeance cryde continually
and with great griefe were often heard to grone
that hardest heart would bleede to heare their piteous mone


through euery rowme he sought and euery bowr
but no where could he find that wofull thrall
at last he came vnto an yron doore
that fast was lockt but key found not at all
emongst that bounch to open it withall
but in the same a little grate was pight
through which he sent his voyce and lowd did call
with all his powre to weet if liuing wight
were housed therewithin whom he enlargen might


therewith an hollow dreary murmuring voyce
these piteous plaints and dolours did resound
o who is that which brings me happy choyce
of death that here lye dying euery stound
yet liue perforce in balefull darkenesse bound
for now three moones haue chãged thrice their hew
and haue beene thrice hid vnderneath the ground
since i the heauens chearefull face did vew
o welcome thou that doest of death bring tydings trew


which when that champion heard with percing point
of pitty deare his hart was thrilled sore
and trembling horrour ran through euery ioynt
for ruth of gentle knight so fowle forlore
which shaking off he rent that yron dore
with furious force and indignation fell
where entred in his foot could find no flore
but all a deepe descent as darke as hell
that breathed euer forth a filthie banefull smell


but neither darkenesse fowle nor filthy bands
nor noyous smell his purpose could withhold
entire affection hateth nicer hands
but that with constant zeale and courage bold
after long paines and labours manifold
he found the meanes that prisoner vp to reare
whose feeble thighes vnhable to vphold
his pined corse him scarse to light could beare
a ruefull spectacle of death and ghastly drere


his sad dull eyes deepe sunck in hollow pits
could not endure thvnwonted sunne to view
his bare thin cheekes for want of better bits
and empty sides deceiued of their dew
could make a stony hart his hap to rew
his rawbone armes whose mighty brawned bowrs
were wont to riue steele plates and helmets hew
were cleane consumd and all his vitall powres
decayd and all his flesh shronk vp like withered flowres


whom when his lady saw to him she ran
with hasty ioy to see him made her glad
and sad to view his visage pale and wan
who earst in flowres of freshest youth was clad
tho when her well of teares she wasted had
she said ah dearest lord what euill starre
on you hath fround and pourd his influence bad
that of your selfe ye thus berobbed arre
and this misseeming hew your manly looks doth marre


but welcome now my lord in wele or woe
whose presence i haue lackt too long a day
and fie on fortune mine auowed foe
whose wrathfull wreakes them selues do now alay
and for these wrongs shall treble penaunce pay
of treble good good growes of euils priefe
the chearelesse man whom sorrow did dismay
had no delight to treaten of his griefe
his long endured famine needed more reliefe


faire lady then said that victorious knight
the things that grieuous were to do or beare
them to renew i wote breeds no delight
best musicke breeds delight in loathing eare
but thonely good that growes of passed feare
is to be wise and ware of like agein
this dayes ensample hath this lesson deare
deepe written in my heart with yron pen
that blisse may not abide in state of mortall men


henceforth sir knight take to you wonted strength
and maister these mishaps with patient might
loe where your foe lyes stretcht in monstrous length
and loe that wicked woman in your sight
the roote of all your care and wretched plight
now in your powre to let her liue or dye
to do her dye quoth vna were despight
and shame tauenge so weake an enimy
but spoile her of her scarlot robe and let her fly


so as she bad that witch they disaraid
and robd of royall robes and purple pall
and ornaments that richly were displaid
ne spared they to strip her naked all
then when they had despoild her tire and call
such as she was their eyes might her behold
that her misshaped parts did them appall
a loathly wrinckled hag ill fauoured old
whose secret filth good manners biddeth not be told


her craftie head was altogether bald
and as in hate of honorable eld
was ouergrowne with scurfe and filthy scald
her teeth out of her rotten gummes were feld
and her sowre breath abhominably smeld
her dried dugs like bladders lacking wind
hong downe and filthy matter from them weld
her wrizled skin as rough as maple rind
so scabby was that would haue loathd all womankind


her neather parts the shame of all her kind
my chaster muse for shame doth blush to write
but at her rompe she growing had behind
a foxes taile with dong all fowly dight
and eke her feete most monstrous were in sight
for one of them was like an eagles claw
with griping talaunts armd to greedy fight
the other like a beares vneuen paw
more vgly shape yet neuer liuing creature saw


which when the knights beheld amazd they were
and wondred at so fowle deformed wight
such then said vna as she seemeth here
such is the face of falshood such the sight
of fowle duessa when her borrowed light
is laid away and counterfesaunce knowne
thus when they had the witch disrobed quight
and all her filthy feature open showne
they let her goe at will and wander wayes vnknowne


she flying fast from heauens hated face
and from the world that her discouered wide
fled to the wastfull wildernesse apace
from liuing eyes her open shame to hide
and lurkt in rocks and caues long vnespide
but that faire crew of knights and vna faire
did in that castle afterwards abide
to rest them selues and weary powres repaire
where store they found of all that dainty was and rare


his loues and lignage arthur tells
the knights knit friendly bands
sir treuisan flies from despayre
whom redcrosse knight withstands


o goodly golden chaine wherewith yfere
the vertues linked are in louely wize
and noble minds of yore allyed were
in braue poursuit of cheualrous emprize
that none did others safety despize
nor aid enuy to him in need that stands
but friendly each did others prayse deuize
how to aduaunce with fauourable hands
as this good prince redeemd the redcrosse knight from bands


who when their powres empaird through labour long
with dew repast they had recured well
and that weake captiue wight now wexed strong
them list no lenger there at leasure dwell
but forward fare as their aduentures fell
but ere they parted vna faire besought
that straunger knight his name and nation tell
least so great good as he for her had wrought
should die vnknown buried be in thanklesse thought


faire virgin said the prince ye me require
a thing without the compas of my wit
for both the lignage and the certain sire
from which i sprong from me are hidden yit
for all so soone as life did me admit
into this world and shewed heauens light
from mothers pap i taken was vnfit
and streight deliuered to a faery knight
to be vpbrought in gentle thewes and martiall might


vnto old timon he me brought byliue
old timon who in youthly yeares hath beene
in warlike feates thexpertest man aliue
and is the wisest now on earth i weene
his dwelling is low in a valley greene
vnder the foot of rauran mossy hore
from whence the riuer dee as siluer cleene
his tombling billowes rolls with gentle rore
there all my dayes he traind me vp in vertuous lore


thither the great magicien merlin came
as was his vse ofttimes to visit me
for he had charge my discipline to frame
and tutours nouriture to ouersee
him oft and oft i askt in priuitie
of what loines and what lignage i did spring
whose aunswere bad me still assured bee
that i was sonne and heire vnto a king
as time in her iust terme the truth to light should bring


well worthy impe said then the lady gent
and pupill fit for such a tutours hand
but what aduenture or what high intent
hath brought you hither into faery land
aread prince arthur crowne of martiall band
full hard it is quoth he to read aright
the course of heauenly cause or vnderstand
the secret meaning of theternall might
that rules mens wayes and rules the thoughts of liuing wight


for whither he through fatall deepe foresight
me hither sent for cause to me vnghest
or that fresh bleeding wound which day and night
whilome doth rancle in my riuen brest
with forced fury following his behest
me hither brought by wayes yet neuer found
you to haue helpt i hold my selfe yet blest
ah curteous knight quoth she what secret wound
could euer find to grieue the gentlest hart on ground


deare dame quoth he you sleeping sparkes awake
which troubled once into huge flames will grow
ne euer will their feruent fury slake
till liuing moysture into smoke do flow
and wasted life do lye in ashes low
yet sithens silence lesseneth not my fire
but told it flames and hidden it does glow
i will reuele what ye so much desire
ah loue lay downe thy bow the whiles i may respire


it was in freshest flowre of youthly yeares
when courage first does creepe in manly chest
then first the coale of kindly heat appeares
to kindle loue in euery liuing brest
but me had warnd old timons wise behest
those creeping flames by reason to subdew
before their rage grew to so great vnrest
as miserable louers vse to rew
which still wex old in woe whiles woe still wexeth new


that idle name of loue and louers life
as losse of time and vertues enimy
i euer scornd and ioyd to stirre vp strife
in middest of their mournfull tragedy
ay wont to laugh when them i heard to cry
and blow the fire which them to ashes brent
their god himselfe grieud at my libertie
shot many a dart at me with fiers intent
but i them warded all with wary gouernment


but all in vaine no fort can be so strong
ne fleshly brest can armed be so sound
but will at last be wonne with battrie long
or vnawares at disauantage found
nothing is sure that growes on earthly ground
and who most trustes in arme of fleshly might
and boasts in beauties chaine not to be bound
doth soonest fall in disauentrous fight
and yeeldes his caytiue neck to victours most despight


ensample make of him your haplesse ioy
and of my selfe now mated as ye see
whose prouder vaunt that proud auenging boy
did soone pluck downe and curbd my libertie
for on a day prickt forth with iollitie
of looser life and heat of hardiment
raunging the forest wide on courser free
the fields the floods the heauens with one consent
did seeme to laugh on me and fauour mine intent


forwearied with my sports i did alight
from loftie steed and downe to sleepe me layd
the verdant gras my couch did goodly dight
and pillow was my helmet faire displayd
whiles euery sence the humour sweet embayd
and slombring soft my hart did steale away
me seemed by my side a royall mayd
her daintie limbes full softly down did lay
so faire a creature yet saw neuer sunny day


most goodly glee and louely blandishment
she to me made and bad me loue her deare
for dearely sure her loue was to me bent
as when iust time expired should appeare
but whether dreames delude or true it were
was neuer hart so rauisht with delight
ne liuing man like words did euer heare
as she to me deliuered all that night
and at her parting said she queene of faeries hight


when i awoke and found her place deuoyd
and nought but pressed gras where she had lyen
i sorrowed all so much as earst i ioyd
and washed all her place with watry eyen
from that day forth i loud that face diuine
from that day forth i cast in carefull mind
to seeke her out with labour and long tyne
and neuer vow to rest till her i find
nine monethes i seeke in vaine yet nill that vow vnbind


thus as he spake his visage wexed pale
and chaunge of hew great passion did bewray
yet still he stroue to cloke his inward bale
and hide the smoke that did his fire display
till gentle vna thus to him gan say
o happy queene of faeries that hast found
mongst many one that with his prowesse may
defend thine honour and thy foes confound
true loues are oftẽ sown but seldom grow on ground


thine o then said the gentle redcrosse knight
next to that ladies loue shalbe the place
o fairest virgin full of heauenly light
whose wondrous faith exceeding earthly race
was firmest fixt in mine extremest case
and you my lord the patrone of my life
of that great queene may well gaine worthy grace
for onely worthy you through prowes priefe
yf liuing man mote worthy be to be her liefe


so diuersly discoursing of their loues
the golden sunne his glistring head gan shew
and sad remembraunce now the prince amoues
with fresh desire his voyage to pursew
als vna earnd her traueill to renew
then those two knights fast friendship for to bynd
and loue establish each to other trew
gaue goodly gifts the signes of gratefull mynd
and eke as pledges firme right hands together ioynd


prince arthur gaue a boxe of diamond sure
embowd with gold and gorgeous ornament
wherein were closd few drops of liquor pure
of wondrous worth and vertue excellent
that any wound could heale incontinent
which to requite the redcrosse knight him gaue
a booke wherein his saueours testament
was writ with golden letters rich and braue
a worke of wondrous grace and able soules to saue


thus beene they parted arthur on his way
to seeke his loue and thother for to fight
with vnaes foe that all her realme did pray
but she now weighing the decayed plight
and shrunken synewes of her chosen knight
would not a while her forward course pursew
ne bring him forth in face of dreadfull fight
till he recouered had his former hew
for him to be yet weake and wearie well she knew


so as they traueild lo they gan espy
an armed knight towards them gallop fast
that seemed from some feared foe to fly
or other griesly thing that him agast
still as he fled his eye was backward cast
as if his feare still followed him behind
als flew his steed as he his bands had brast
and with his winged heeles did tread the wind
as he had beene a fole of pegasus his kind


nigh as he drew they might perceiue his head
to be vnarmd and curld vncombed heares
vpstaring stiffe dismayd with vncouth dread
nor drop of bloud in all his face appeares
nor life in limbe and to increase his feares
in fowle reproch of knighthoods faire degree
about his neck an hempen rope he weares
that with his glistring armes does ill agree
but he of rope or armes has now no memoree


the redcrosse knight toward him crossed fast
to weet what mister wight was so dismayd
there him he finds all sencelesse and aghast
that of him selfe he seemd to be afrayd
whom hardly he from flying forward stayd
till he these wordes to him deliuer might
sir knight aread who hath ye thus arayd
and eke from whom make ye this hasty flight
for neuer knight i saw in such misseeming plight


he answerd nought at all but adding new
feare to his first amazment staring wide
with stony eyes and hartlesse hollow hew
astonisht stood as one that had aspide
infernall furies with their chaines vntide
him yet againe and yet againe bespake
the gentle knight who nought to him replide
but trembling euery ioynt did inly quake
and foltring tongue at last these words seemd forth to shake


for gods deare loue sir knight do me not stay
for loe he comes he comes fast after mee
eft looking backe would faine haue runne away
but he him forst to stay and tellen free
the secret cause of his perplexitie
yet nathemore by his bold hartie speach
could his bloudfrosen hart emboldned bee
but through his boldnesse rather feare did reach
yet forst at last he made through silence suddein breach


and am i now in safetie sure quoth he
from him that would haue forced me to dye
and is the point of death now turnd fro mee
that i may tell this haplesse history
feare nought quoth he no daunger now is nye
then shall i you recount a ruefull cace
said he the which with this vnlucky eye
i late beheld and had not greater grace
me reft from it had bene partaker of the place


i lately chaunst would i had neuer chaunst
with a faire knight to keepen companee
sir terwin hight that well himselfe aduaunst
in all affaires and was both bold and free
but not so happie as mote happie bee
he loud as was his lot a ladie gent
that him againe loud in the least degree
for she was proud and of too high intent
and ioyd to see her louer languish and lament


from whom returning sad and comfortlesse
as on the way together we did fare
we met that villen god from him me blesse
that cursed wight from whom i scapt whyleare
a man of hell that cals himselfe despaire
who first vs greets and after faire areedes
of tydings strange and of aduentures rare
so creeping close as snake in hidden weedes
inquireth of our states and of our knightly deedes


which when he knew and felt ourfeeble harts
embost with bale and bitter byting griefe
which loue had launched with his deadly darts
with wounding words and termes of foule repriefe
he pluckt from vs all hope of due reliefe
that earst vs held in loue of lingring life
then hopelesse hartlesse gan the cunning thiefe
perswade vs die to stint all further strife
to me he lent this rope to him a rustie knife


with which sad instrument of hastie death
that wofull louer loathing lenger light
a wide way made to let forth liuing breath
but i more fearefull or more luckie wight
dismayd with that deformed dismall sight
fled fast away halfe dead with dying feare
ne yet assurd of life by you sir knight
whose like infirmitie like chaunce may beare
but god you neuer let his charmed speeches heare


how may a man said he with idle speach
be wonne to spoyle the castle of his health
i wote quoth he whom triall late did teach
that like would not for all this worldes wealth
his subtill tongue like dropping honny mealtth
into the hart and searcheth euery vaine
that ere one be aware by secret stealth
his powre is reft and weaknesse doth remaine
o neuer sir desire to try his guilefull traine


certes said he hence shall i neuer rest
till i that treachours art haue heard and tride
and you sir knight whose name mote i request
of grace do me vnto his cabin guide
i that hight treuisan quoth he will ride
against my liking backe to doe you grace
but nor for gold nor glee will i abide
by you when ye arriue in that same place
for leuer had i die then see his deadly face


ere long they come where that same wicked wight
his dwelling has low in an hollow caue
farre vnderneath a craggie clift ypight
darke dolefull drearie like a greedie graue
that still for carrion carcases doth craue
on top whereof aye dwelt the ghastly owle
shrieking his balefull note which euer draue
farre from that haunt all other chearefull fowle
and all about it wandring ghostes did waile and howle


and all about old stockes and stubs of trees
whereon nor fruit nor leafe was euer seene
did hang vpon the ragged rocky knees
on which had many wretches hanged beene
whose carcases were scattered on the greene
and throwne about the cliffs arriued there
that barehead knight for dread and dolefull teene
would faine haue fled ne durst approchen neare
but thother forst him stay and comforted in feare


that darkesome caue they enter where they find
that cursed man low sitting on the ground
musing full sadly in his sullein mind
his griesie lockes long growen and vnbound
disordred hong about his shoulders round
and hid his face through which his hollow eyne
lookt deadly dull and stared as astound
his rawbone cheekes through penurie and pine
were shronke into his iawes as he did neuer dine


his garment nought but many ragged clouts
with thornes together pind and patched was
the which his naked sides he wrapt abouts
and him beside there lay vpon the gras
a drearie corse whose life away did pas
all wallowd in his owne yet lukewarme blood
that from his wound yet welled fresh alas
in which a rustie knife fast fixed stood
and made an open passage for the gushing flood


which piteous spectacle approuing trew
the wofull tale that treuisan had told
when as the gentle redcrosse knight did vew
with firie zeale he burnt in courage bold
him to auenge before his bloud were cold
and to the villein said thou damned wight
the author of this fact we here behold
what iustice can but iudge against thee right
with thine owne bloud to price his bloud here shed in sight


what franticke fit quoth he hath thus distraught
thee foolish man so rash a doome to giue
what iustice euer other iudgement taught
but he should die who merites not to liue
none else to death this man despayring driue
but his owne guiltie mind deseruing death
is then vniust to each his due to giue
or let him die that loatheth liuing breath
or let him die at ease that liueth here vneath


who trauels by the wearie wandring way
to come vnto his wished home in haste
and meetes a flood that doth his passage stay
is not great grace to helpe him ouer past
or free his feet that in the myre sticke fast
most enuious man that grieues at neighbours good
and fond that ioyest in the woe thou hast
why wilt not let him passe that long hath stood
vpon the banke yet wilt thy selfe not passe the flood


he there does now enioy eternall rest
and happie ease which thou doest want and craue
and further from it daily wanderest
what if some litle paine the passage haue
that makes fraile flesh to feare the bitter waue
is not short paine well borne that brings long ease
and layes the soule to sleepe in quiet graue
sleepe after toyle port after stormie seas
ease after warre death after life does greatly please


the knight much wondred at his suddeine wit
and said the terme of life is limited
ne may a man prolong nor shorten it
the souldier may not moue from watchfull sted
nor leaue his stand vntill his captaine bed
who life did limit by almightie doome
quoth he knowes best the termes established
and he that points the centonell his roome
doth license him depart at sound of morning droome


is not his deed what euer thing is donne
in heauen and earth did not he all create
to die againe all ends that was begonne
their times in his eternall booke of fate
are written sure and haue their certaine date
who then can striue with strong necessitie
that holds the world in his still chaunging state
or shunne the death ordaynd by destinie
whẽ houre of death is come let none aske whence nor why


the lenger life i wote the greater sin
the greater sin the greater punishment
all those great battels which thou boasts to win
through strife and bloudshed and auengement
now praysd hereafter deare thou shalt repent
for life must life and bloud must bloud repay
is not enough thy euill life forespent
for he that once hath missed the right way
the further he doth goe the further he doth stray


then do no further goe no further stray
but here lie downe and to thy rest betake
thill to preuent that life ensewen may
for what hath life that may it loued make
and giues not rather cause it to forsake
feare sicknesse age losse labour sorrow strife
paine hunger cold that makes the hart to quake
and euer fickle fortune rageth rife
all which and thousands mo do make a loathsome life


thou wretched man of death hast greatest need
if in true ballance thou wilt weigh thy state
for neuer knight that dared warlike deede
more lucklesse disauentures did amate
witnesse the dongeon deepe wherein of late
thy life shut vp for death so oft did call
and though good lucke prolonged hath thy date
yet death then would the like mishaps forestall
into the which hereafter thou maiest happen fall


why then doest thou ô man of sin desire
to draw thy dayes forth to their last degree
is not the measure of thy sinfull hire
high heaped vp with huge iniquitie
against the day of wrath to burden thee
is not enough that to this ladie milde
thou falsed hast thy faith with periurie
and sold thy selfe to serue duessa vilde
with whom in all abuse thou hast thy selfe defilde


is not he iust that all this doth behold
from highest heauen and beares an equall eye
shall he thy sins vp in his knowledge fold
and guiltie be of thine impietie
is not his law let euery sinner die
die shall all flesh what then must needs be donne
is it not better to doe willinglie
then linger till the glasse be all out ronne
death is the end of woes die soone o faeries sonne


the knight was much enmoued with his speach
that as a swords point through his hart did perse
and in his conscience made a secret breach
well knowing true all that he did reherse
and to his fresh remembrance did reuerse
the vgly vew of his deformed crimes
that all his manly powres it did disperse
as he were charmed with inchaunted rimes
that oftentimes he quakt and fainted oftentimes


in which amazement when the miscreant
perceiued him to wauer weake and fraile
whiles trembling horror did his conscience dant
and hellish anguish did his soule assaile
to driue him to despaire and quite to quaile
he shewd him painted in a table plaine
the damned ghosts that doe in torments waile
and thousand feends that doe them endlesse paine
with fire and brimstone which for euer shall remaine


the sight whereof so throughly him dismaid
that nought but death before his eyes he saw
and euer burning wrath before him laid
by righteous sentence of thalmighties law
then gan the villein him to ouercraw
and brought vnto him swords ropes poison fire
and all that might him to perdition draw
and bad him choose what death he would desire
for death was due to him that had prouokt gods ire


but when as none of them he saw him take
he to him raught a dagger sharpe and keene
and gaue it him in hand his hand did quake
and tremble like a leafe of aspin greene
and troubled bloud through his pale face was seene
to come and goe with tydings from the hart
as it a running messenger had beene
at last resolud to worke his finall smart
he lifted vp his hand that backe againe did start


which when as vna saw through euery vaine
the crudled cold ran to her well of life
as in a swowne but soone reliud againe
out of his hand she snatcht the cursed knife
and threw it to the ground enraged rife
and to him said fie fie faint harted knight
what meanest thou by this reprochfull strife
is this the battell which thou vauntst to fight
with that firemouthed dragon horrible and bright


come come away fraile seely fleshly wight
ne let vaine words bewitch thy manly hart
ne diuelish thoughts dismay thy constant spright
in heauenly mercies hast thou not a part
why shouldst thou then despeire that chosen art
where iustice growes there grows eke greater grace
the which doth quench the brond of hellish smart
and that accurst handwriting doth deface
arise sir knight arise and leaue this cursed place


so vp he rose and thence amounted streight
which when the carle beheld and saw his guest
would safe depart for all his subtill sleight
he chose an halter from among the rest
and with it hung himselfe vnbid vnblest
but death he could not worke himselfe thereby
for thousand times he so himselfe had drest
yet nathelesse it could not doe him die
till he should die his last that is eternally


her faithfull knight faire vna brings
to house of holinesse
where he is taught repentance and
the way to heauenly blesse


what man is he that boasts of fleshly might
and vaine assurance of mortality
which all so soone as it doth come to fight
against spirituall foes yeelds by and by
or from the field most cowardly doth fly
ne let the man ascribe it to his skill
that thorough grace hath gained victory
if any strength we haue it is to ill
but all the good is gods both power and eke will


by that which lately hapned vna saw
that this her knight was feeble and too faint
and all his sinews woxen weake and raw
through long enprisonment and hard constraint
which he endured in his late restraint
that yet he was vnfit for bloudie fight
therefore to cherish him with diets daint
she cast to bring him where he chearen might
till he recouered had his late decayed plight


there was an auntient house not farre away
renowmd throughout the world for sacred lore
and pure vnspotted life so well they say
it gouernd was and guided euermore
through wisedome of a matrone graue and hore
whose onely ioy was to relieue the needes
of wretched soules and helpe the helpelesse pore
all night she spent in bidding of her bedes
and all the day in doing good and godly deedes


dame cælia men did her call as thought
from heauen to come or thither to arise
the mother of three daughters well vpbrought
in goodly thewes and godly exercise
the eldest two most sober chast and wise
fidelia and speranza virgins were
though spousd yet wanting wedlocks solemnize
but faire charissa to a louely fere
was lincked and by him had many pledges dere


arriued there the dore they find fast lockt
for it was warely watched night and day
for feare of many foes but when they knockt
the porter opened vnto them streight way
he was an aged syre all hory gray
with lookes full lowly cast and gate full slow
wont on a staffe his feeble steps to stay
hight humiltá they passe in stouping low
for streight narrow was the way which he did show


each goodly thing is hardest to begin
but entred in a spacious court they see
both plaine and pleasant to be walked in
where them does meete a francklin faire and free
and entertaines with comely courteous glee
his name was zele that him right well became
for in his speeches and behauiour hee
did labour liuely to expresse the same
and gladly did them guide till to the hall they came


there fairely them receiues a gentle squire
of milde demeanure and rare courtesie
right cleanly clad in comely sad attire
in word and deede that shewd great modestie
and knew his good to all of each degree
hight reuerence he them with speeches meet
does faire entreat no courting nicetie
but simple true and eke vnfained sweet
as might become a squire so great persons to greet


and afterwards them to his dame he leades
that aged dame the ladie of the place
who all this while was busie at her beades
which doen she vp arose with seemely grace
and toward them full matronely did pace
where when that fairest vna she beheld
whom well she knew to spring from heauenly race
her hart with ioy vnwonted inly sweld
as feeling wondrous comfort in her weaker eld


and her embracing said ô happie earth
whereon thy innocent feet doe euer tread
most vertuous virgin borne of heauenly berth
that to redeeme thy woefull parents head
from tyrans rage and euerdying dread
hast wandred through the world now long a day
yet ceasest not thy wearie soles to lead
what grace hath thee now hither brought this way
or doen thy feeble feet vnweeting hither stray


strange thing it is an errant knight to see
here in this place or any other wight
that hither turnes his steps so few there bee
that chose the narrow path or seeke the right
all keepe the broad high way and take delight
with many rather for to go astray
and be partakers of their euill plight
then with a few to walke the rightest way
o foolish men why haste ye to your owne decay


thy selfe to see and tyred limbs to rest
o matrone sage quoth she i hither came
and this good knight his way with me addrest
led with thy prayses and broadblazed fame
that vp to heauen is blowne the auncient dame
him goodly greeted in her modest guise
and entertaynd them both as best became
with all the courtsies that she could deuise
ne wanted ought to shew her bounteous or wise


thus as they gan of sundry things deuise
loe two most goodly virgins came in place
ylinked arme in arme in louely wise
with countenance demure and modest grace
they numberd euen steps and equall pace
of which the eldest that fidelia hight
like sunny beames threw from her christall face
that could haue dazd the rash beholders sight
and round about her head did shine like heauens light


she was araied all in lilly white
and in her right hand bore a cup of gold
with wine and water fild vp to the hight
in which a serpent did himselfe enfold
that horrour made to all that did behold
but she no whit did chaunge her constant mood
and in her other hand she fast did hold
a booke that was both signd and seald with blood
wherein darke things were writ hard to be vnderstood


her younger sister that speranza hight
was clad in blew that her beseemed well
not all so chearefull seemed she of sight
as was her sister whether dread did dwell
or anguish in her hart is hard to tell
vpon her arme a siluer anchor lay
whereon she leaned euer as befell
and euer vp to heauen as she did pray
her stedfast eyes were bent ne swarued other way


they seeing vna towards her gan wend
who them encounters with like courtesie
many kind speeches they betwene them spend
and greatly ioy each other well to see
then to the knight with shamefast modestie
they turne themselues at vnaes meeke request
and him salute with well beseeming glee
who faire them quites as him beseemed best
and goodly gan discourse of many a noble gest


then vna thus but she your sister deare
the deare charissa where is she become
or wants she health or busie is elsewhere
ah no said they but forth she may not come
for she of late is lightned of her wombe
and hath encreast the world with one sonne more
that her to see should be but troublesome
indeede quoth she that should her trouble sore
but thankt be god and her encrease so euermore


then said the aged coelia deare dame
and you good sir i wote that of your toyle
and labours long through which ye hither came
ye both forwearied be therefore a whyle
i read you rest and to your bowres recoyle
then called she a groome that forth him led
into a goodly lodge and gan despoile
of puissant armes and laid in easie bed
his name was meeke obedience rightfully ared


now when their wearie limbes with kindly rest
and bodies were refresht with due repast
faire vna gan fidelia faire request
to haue her knight into her schoolehouse plaste
that of her heauenly learning he might taste
and heare the wisedome of her words diuine
she graunted and that knight so much agraste
that she him taught celestiall discipline
and opened his dull eyes that light mote in them shine


and that her sacred booke with bloud ywrit
that none could read except she did them teach
she vnto him disclosed euery whit
and heauenly documents thereout did preach
that weaker wit of man could neuer reach
of god of grace of iustice of free will
that wonder was to heare her goodly speach
for she was able with her words to kill
and raise againe to life the hart that she did thrill


and when she list poure out her larger spright
she would commaund the hastie sunne to stay
or backward turne his course from heauens hight
sometimes great hostes of men she could dismay
dryshod to passe she parts the flouds in tway
and eke huge mountaines from their natiue seat
she would commaund themselues to beare away
and throw in raging sea with roaring threat
almightie god her gaue such powre and puissance great


the faithfull knight now grew in litle space
by hearing her and by her sisters lore
to such perfection of all heauenly grace
that wretched world he gan for to abhore
and mortall life gan loath as thing forlore
greeud with remembrance of his wicked wayes
and prickt with anguish of his sinnes so sore
that he desirde to end his wretched dayes
so much the dart of sinfull guilt the soule dismayes


but wise speranza gaue him comfort sweet
and taught him how to take assured hold
vpon her siluer anchor as was meet
else had his sinnes so great and manifold
made him forget all that fidelia told
in this distressed doubtfull agonie
when him his dearest vna did behold
disdeining life desiring leaue to die
she found her selfe assayld with great perplexitie


and came to coelia to declare her smart
who well acquainted with that commune plight
which sinfull horror workes in wounded hart
her wisely comforted all that she might
with goodly counsell and aduisement right
and streightway sent with carefull diligence
to fetch a leach the which had great insight
in that disease of grieued conscience
and well could cure the same his name was patience


who comming to that soulediseased knight
could hardly him intreat to tell his griefe
which knowne and all that noyd his heauie spright
well searcht eftsoones he gan apply reliefe
of salues and medcines which had passing priefe
and thereto added words of wondrous might
by which to ease he him recured briefe
and much asswagd the passion of his plight
that he his paine endurd as seeming now more light


but yet the cause and root of all his ill
inward corruption and infected sin
not purgd nor heald behind remained still
and festring sore did rankle yet within
close creeping twixt the marrow and the skin
which to extirpe he laid him priuily
downe in a darkesome lowly place farre in
whereas he meant his corrosiues to apply
and with streight diet tame his stubborne malady


in ashes and sackcloth he did array
his daintie corse proud humors to abate
and dieted with fasting euery day
the swelling of his wounds to mitigate
and made him pray both earely and eke late
and euer as superfluous flesh did rot
amendment readie still at hand did wayt
to pluck it out with pincers firie whot
that soone in him was left no one corrupted iot


and bitter penance with an yron whip
was wont him once to disple euery day
and sharpe remorse his hart did pricke and nip
that drops of bloud thence like a well did play
and sad repentance vsed to embay
his bodie in salt water smarting sore
the filthy blots of sinne to wash away
so in short space they did to health restore
the man that would not liue but earst lay at deathes dore


in which his torment often was so great
that like a lyon he would cry and rore
and rend his flesh and his owne synewes eat
his owne deare vna hearing euermore
his ruefull shriekes and gronings often tore
her guiltlesse garments and her golden heare
for pitty of his paine and anguish sore
yet all with patience wisely she did beare
for well she wist his crime could else be neuer cleare


whom thus recouerd by wise patience
and trew repentance they to vna brought
who ioyous of his cured conscience
him dearely kist and fairely eke besought
himselfe to chearish and consuming thought
to put away out of his carefull brest
by this charissa late in childbed brought
was woxen strong and left her fruitfull nest
to her faire vna brought this vnacquainted guest


she was a woman in her freshest age
of wondrous beauty and of bountie rare
with goodly grace and comely personage
that was on earth not easie to compare
full of great loue but cupids wanton snare
as hell she hated chast in worke and will
her necke and breasts were euer open bare
that ay thereof her babes might sucke their fill
the rest was all in yellow robes arayed still


a multitude of babes about her hong
playing their sports that ioyd her to behold
whom still she fed whiles they were weake young
but thrust them forth still as they wexed old
and on her head she wore a tyre of gold
adornd with gemmes and owches wondrous faire
whose passing price vneath was to be told
and by her side there sate a gentle paire
of turtle doues she sitting in an yuorie chaire


the knight and vna entring faire her greet
and bid her ioy of that her happie brood
who them requites with courtsies seeming meet
and entertaines with friendly chearefull mood
then vna her besought to be so good
as in her vertuous rules to schoole her knight
now after all his torment well withstood
in that sad house of penaunce where his spright
had past the paines of hell and long enduring night


she was right ioyous of her iust request
and taking by the hand that faeries sonne
gan him instruct in euery good behest
of loue and righteousnesse and well to donne
and wrath and hatred warely to shonne
that drew on men gods hatred and his wrath
and many soules in dolours had fordonne
in which when him she well instructed hath
from thence to heauen she teacheth him the ready path


wherein his weaker wandring steps to guide
an auncient matrone she to her does call
whose sober lookes her wisedome well descride
her name was mercie well knowne ouer all
to be both gratious and eke liberall
to whom the carefull charge of him she gaue
to lead aright that he should neuer fall
in all his wayes through this wide worldes waue
that mercy in the end his righteous soule might saue


the godly matrone by the hand him beares
forth from her presence by a narrow way
scattred with bushy thornes and ragged breares
which still before him she remoud away
that nothing might his ready passage stay
and euer when his feet encombred were
or gan to shrinke or from the right to stray
she held him fast and firmely did vpbeare
as carefull nourse her child from falling oft does reare


eftsoones vnto an holy hospitall
that was fore by the way she did him bring
in which seuen beadmen that had vowed all
their life to seruice of high heauens king
did spend their dayes in doing godly thing
their gates to all were open euermore
that by the wearie way were traueiling
and one sate wayting euer them before
to call incommers by that needy were and pore


the first of them that eldest was and best
of all the house had charge and gouernement
as guardian and steward of the rest
his office was to giue entertainement
and lodging vnto all that came and went
not vnto such as could him feast againe
and double quite for that he on them spent
but such as want of harbour did constraine
those for gods sake his dewty was to entertaine


the second was as almner of the place
his office was the hungry for to feed
and thristy giue to drinke a worke of grace
he feard not once him selfe to be in need
ne card to hoord for those whom he did breede
the grace of god he layd vp still in store
which as a stocke he left vnto his seede
he had enough what need him care for more
and had he lesse yet some he would giue to the pore


the third had of their wardrobe custodie
in which were not rich tyres nor garments gay
the plumes of pride and wings of vanitie
but clothes meet to keepe keene could away
and naked nature seemely to aray
with which bare wretched wights he dayly clad
the images of god in earthly clay
and if that no spare cloths to giue he had
his owne coate he would cut and it distribute glad


the fourth appointed by his office was
poore prisoners to relieue with gratious ayd
and captiues to redeeme with price of bras
from turkes and sarazins which them had stayd
and though they faultie were yet well he wayd
that god to vs forgiueth euery howre
much more then that why they in bands were layd
and he that harrowd hell with heauie stowre
the faultie soules from thence brought to his heauenly bowre


the fift had charge sicke persons to attend
and comfort those in point of death which lay
for them most needeth comfort in the end
when sin and hell and death do most dismay
the feeble soule departing hence away
all is but lost that liuing we bestow
if not well ended at our dying day
o man haue mind of that last bitter throw
for as the tree does fall so lyes it euer low


the sixt had charge of them now being dead
in seemely sort their corses to engraue
and deck with dainty flowres their bridall bed
that to their heauenly spouse both sweet and braue
they might appeare when he their soules shall saue
the wondrous workemanship of gods owne mould
whose face he made all beasts to feare and gaue
all in his hand euen dead we honour should
ah dearest god me graunt i dead be not defould


the seuenth now after death and buriall done
had charge the tender orphans of the dead
and widowes ayd least they should be vndone
in face of iudgement he their right would plead
ne ought the powre of mighty men did dread
in their defence nor would for gold or fee
be wonne their rightfull causes downe to tread
and when they stood in most necessitee
he did supply their want and gaue them euer free


there when the elfin knight arriued was
the first and chiefest of the seuen whose care
was guests to welcome towardes him did pas
where seeing mercie that his steps vp bare
and alwayes led to her with reuerence rare
he humbly louted in meeke lowlinesse
and seemely welcome for her did prepare
for of their order she was patronesse
albe charissa were their chiefest founderesse


there she awhile him stayes him selfe to rest
that to the rest more able he might bee
during which time in euery good behest
and godly worke of almes and charitee
she him instructed with great industree
shortly therein so perfect he became
that from the first vnto the last degree
his mortall life he learned had to frame
in holy righteousnesse without rebuke or blame


thence forward by that painfull way they pas
forth to an hill that was both steepe and hy
on top whereof a sacred chappell was
and eke a litle hermitage thereby
wherein an aged holy man did lye
that day and night said his deuotion
ne other worldly busines did apply
his name was heauenly contemplation
of god and goodnesse was his meditation


great grace that old man to him giuen had
for god he often saw from heauens hight
all were his earthly eyen both blunt and bad
and through great age had lost their kindly sight
yet wondrous quick and persant was his spright
as eagles eye that can behold the sunne
that hill they scale with all their powre and might
that his frayle thighes nigh wearie and fordonne
gan faile but by her helpe the top at last he wonne


there they do finde that godly aged sire
with snowy lockes adowne his shoulders shed
as hoarie frost with spangles doth attire
the mossy braunches of an oke halfe ded
each bone might through his body well be red
and euery sinew seene through his long fast
for nought he card his carcas long vnfed
his mind was full of spirituall repast
and pynd his flesh to keepe his body low and chast


who when these two approching he aspide
at their first presence grew agrieued sore
that forst him lay his heauenly thoughts aside
and had he not that dame respected more
whom highly he did reuerence and adore
he would not once haue moued for the knight
they him saluted standing far afore
who well them greeting humbly did requight
and asked to what end they clomb that tedious height


what end quoth she should cause vs take such paine
but that same end which euery liuing wight
should make his marke high heauen to attaine
is not from hence the way that leadeth right
to that most glorious house that glistreth bright
with burning starres and euerliuing fire
whereof the keyes are to thy hand behight
by wise fidelia she doth thee require
to shew it to this knight according his desire


thrise happy man said then the father graue
whose staggering steps thy steady hand doth lead
and shewes the way his sinfull soule to saue
who better can the way to heauen aread
then thou thy selfe that was both borne and bred
in heauenly throne where thousand angels shine
thou doest the prayers of the righteous sead
present before the maiestie diuine
and his auenging wrath to clemencie incline


yet since thou bidst thy pleasure shalbe donne
then come thou man of earth and see the way
that neuer yet was seene of faeries sonne
that neuer leads the traueiler astray
but after labours long and sad delay
brings them to ioyous rest and endlesse blis
but first thou must a season fast and pray
till from her bands the spright assoiled is
and haue her strength recurd from fraile infirmitis


that done he leads him to the highest mount
such one as that same mighty man of god
that bloudred billowes like a walled front
on either side disparted with his rod
till that his army dryfoot through them yod
dwelt fortie dayes vpon where writ in stone
with bloudy letters by the hand of god
the bitter doome of death and balefull mone
he did receiue whiles flashing fire about him shone


or like that sacred hill whose head full hie
adornd with fruitfull oliues all arownd
is as it were for endlesse memory
of that deare lord who oft thereon was fownd
for euer with a flowring girlond crownd
or like that pleasaunt mount that is for ay
through famous poets verse each where renownd
on which the thrise three learned ladies play
their heauenly notes and make full many a louely lay


from thence far off he vnto him did shew
a litle path that was both steepe and long
which to a goodly citie led his vew
whose wals and towres were builded high and strong
of perle and precious stone that earthly tong
cannot describe nor wit of man can tell
too high a ditty for my simple song
the citie of the great king hight it well
wherein eternall peace and happinesse doth dwell


as he thereon stood gazing he might see
the blessed angels to and fro descend
from highest heauen in gladsome companee
and with great ioy into that citie wend
as commonly as friend does with his frend
whereat he wondred much and gan enquere
what stately building durst so high extend
her loftie towres vnto the starry sphere
and what vnknowen nation there empeopled were


faire knight quoth he hierusalem that is
the new hierusalem that god has built
for those to dwell in that are chosen his
his chosen people purgd from sinfull guilt
with pretious bloud which cruelly was spilt
on cursed tree of that vnspotted lam
that for the sinnes of all the world was kilt
now are they saints all in that citie sam
more deare vnto their god then yoũglings to their dam


till now said then the knight i weened well
that great cleopolis where i haue beene
in which that fairest faerie queene doth dwell
the fairest citie was that might be seene
and that bright towre all built of christall cleene
panthea seemd the brightest thing that was
but now by proofe all otherwise i weene
for this great citie that does far surpas
and this bright angels towre quite dims that towre of glas


most trew then said the holy aged man
yet is cleopolis for earthly frame
the fairest peece that eye beholden can
and well beseemes all knights of noble name
that couet in thimmortall booke of fame
to be eternized that same to haunt
and doen their seruice to that soueraigne dame
that glorie does to them for guerdon graunt
for she is heauenly borne and heauen may iustly vaunt


and thou faire ymp sprong out from english race
how euer now accompted elfins sonne
well worthy doest thy seruice for her grace
to aide a virgin desolate foredonne
but when thou famous victorie hast wonne
and high emongst all knights hast hong thy shield
thenceforth the suit of earthly conquest shonne
and wash thy hands from guilt of bloudy field
for bloud can nought but sin wars but sorrowes yield


then seeke this path that i to thee presage
which after all to heauen shall thee send
then peaceably thy painefull pilgrimage
to yonder same hierusalem do bend
where is for thee ordaind a blessed end
for thou emongst those saints whom thou doest see
shalt be a saint and thine owne nations frend
and patrone thou saint george shalt called bee
saint george of mery england the signe of victoree


vnworthy wretch quoth he of so great grace
how dare i thinke such glory to attaine
these that haue it attaind were in like cace
quoth he as wretched and liud in like paine
but deeds of armes must i at last be faine
and ladies loue to leaue so dearely bought
what need of armes where peace doth ay remaine
said he and battailes none are to be fought
as for loose loues they are vaine and vanish into nought


o let me not quoth he then turne againe
backe to the world whose ioyes so fruitlesse are
but let me here for aye in peace remaine
or streight way on that last long voyage fare
that nothing may my present hope empare
that may not be said he ne maist thou yit
forgo that royall maides bequeathed care
who did her cause into thy hand commit
till from her cursed foe thou haue her freely quit


then shall i soone quoth he so god me grace
abet that virgins cause disconsolate
and shortly backe returne vnto this place
to walke this way in pilgrims poore estate
but now aread old father why of late
didst thou behight me borne of english blood
whom all a faeries sonne doen nominate
that word shall i said he auouchen good
sith to thee is vnknowne the cradle of thy brood


for well i wote thou springst from ancient race
of saxon kings that haue with mightie hand
and many bloudie battailes fought in place
high reard their royall throne in britane land
and vanquisht them vnable to withstand
from thence a faerie thee vnweeting reft
there as thou slepst in tender swadling band
and her base elfin brood there for thee left
such men do chaungelings call so chaungd by faeries theft


thence she thee brought into this faerie lond
and in an heaped furrow did thee hyde
where thee a ploughman all vnweeting fond
as he his toylesome teme that way did guyde
and brought thee vp in ploughmans state to byde
whereof georgos he thee gaue to name
till prickt with courage and thy forces pryde
to faery court thou camst to seeke for fame
and proue thy puissaunt armes as seemes thee best became


o holy sire quoth he how shall i quight
the many fauours i with thee haue found
that hast my name and nation red aright
and taught the way that does to heauen bound
this said adowne he looked to the ground
to haue returnd but dazed were his eyne
through passing brightnesse which did quite cõfound
his feeble sence and too exceeding shyne
so darke are earthly things compard to things diuine


at last whenas himselfe he gan to find
to vna back he cast him to retire
who him awaited still with pensiue mind
great thankes and goodly meed to that good syre
he thence departing gaue for his paines hyre
so came to vna who him ioyd to see
and after litle rest gan him desire
of her aduenture mindfull for to bee
so leaue they take of coelia and her daughters three


the knight with that old dragon fights
two dayes incessantly
the third him ouerthrowes and gayns
most glorious victory


high time now gan it wex for vna faire
to thinke of those her captiue parents deare
and their forwasted kingdome to repaire
whereto whenas they now approched neare
with hartie words her knight she gan to cheare
and in her modest manner thus bespake
deare knight as deare as euer knight was deare
that all these sorrowes suffer for my sake
high heauen behold the tedious toyle ye for me take


now are we come vnto my natiue soyle
and to the place where all our perils dwell
here haunts that feend and does his dayly spoyle
therefore henceforth be at your keeping well
and euer ready for your foeman fell
the sparke of noble courage now awake
and striue your excellent selfe to excell
that shall ye euermore renowmed make
aboue all knights on earth that batteill vndertake


and pointing forth lo yonder is said she
the brasen towre in which my parents deare
for dread of that huge feend emprisond be
whom i from far see on the walles appeare
whose sight my feeble soule doth greatly cheare
and on the top of all i do espye
the watchman wayting tydings glad to heare
that ô my parents might i happily
vnto you bring to ease you of your misery


with that they heard a roaring hideous sound
that all the ayre with terrour filled wide
and seemd vneath to shake the stedfast ground
eftsoones that dreadfull dragon they espide
where stretcht he lay vpon the sunny side
of a great hill himselfe like a great hill
but all so soone as he from far descride
those glistring armes that heauen with light did fill
he rousd himselfe full blith and hastned them vntill


then bad the knight his lady yede aloofe
and to an hill her selfe with draw aside
from whence she might behold that battailles proof
and eke be safe from daunger far descryde
she him obayd and turnd a little wyde
now o thou sacred muse most learned dame
faire ympe of phoebus and his aged bride
the nourse of time and euerlasting fame
that warlike hands ennoblest with immortall name


o gently come into my feeble brest
come gently but not with that mighty rage
wherewith the martiall troupes thou doest infest
and harts of great heroës doest enrage
that nought their kindled courage may aswage
soone as thy dreadfull trompe begins to sownd
the god of warre with his fiers equipage
thou doest awake sleepe neuer he so sownd
and scared nations doest with horrour sterne astownd


faire goddesse lay that furious fit aside
till i of warres and bloudy mars do sing
and briton fields with sarazin bloud bedyde
twixt that great faery queene and paynim king
that with their horrour heauen and earth did ring
a worke of labour long and endlesse prayse
but now a while let downe that haughtie string
and to my tunes thy second tenor rayse
that i this man of god his godly armes may blaze


by this the dreadfull beast drew nigh to hand
halfe flying and halfe footing in his hast
that with his largenesse measured much land
and made wide shadow vnder his huge wast
as mountaine doth the valley ouercast
approching nigh he reared high afore
his body monstrous horrible and vast
which to increase his wondrous greatnesse more
was swolne with wrath poyson with bloudy gore


and ouer all with brasen scales was armd
like plated coate of steele so couched neare
that nought mote perce ne might his corse be harmd
with dint of sword nor push of pointed speare
which as an eagle seeing pray appeare
his aery plumes doth rouze full rudely dight
so shaked he that horrour was to heare
for as the clashing of an armour bright
such noyse his rouzed scales did send vnto the knight


his flaggy wings when forth he did display
were like two sayles in which the hollow wynd
is gathered full and worketh speedy way
and eke the pennes that did his pineons bynd
were like mayneyards with flying canuas lynd
with which whenas him list the ayre to beat
and there by force vnwonted passage find
the cloudes before him fled for terrour great
and all the heauens stood still amazed with his threat


his huge long tayle wound vp in hundred foldes
does ouerspred his long brasscaly backe
whose wreathed boughts when euer he vnfoldes
and thicke entangled knots adown does slacke
bespotted all with shields of red and blacke
it sweepeth all the land behind him farre
and of three furlongs does but litle lacke
and at the point two stings infixed arre
both deadly sharpe that sharpest steele exceeden farre


but stings and sharpest steele did far exceed
the sharpnesse of his cruell rending clawes
dead was it sure as sure as death in deed
what euer thing does touch his rauenous pawes
or what within his reach he euer drawes
but his most hideous head my toung to tell
does tremble for his deepe deuouring iawes
wide gaped like the griesly mouth of hell
through which into his darke abisse all rauin fell


and that more wondrous was in either iaw
three ranckes of yron teeth enraunged were
in which yet trickling bloud and gobbets raw
of late deuoured bodies did appeare
that sight thereof bred cold congealed feare
which to increase and as atonce to kill
a cloud of smoothering smoke and sulphur seare
out of his stinking gorge forth steemed still
that all the ayre about with smoke and stench did fill


his blazing eyes like two bright shining shields
did burne with wrath and sparkled liuing fyre
as two broad beacons set in open fields
send forth their flames farre off to euery shyre
and warning giue that enemies conspyre
with fire and sword the region to inuade
so flamd his eyne with rage and rancorous yre
but farre within as in a hollow glade
those glaring lampes were set that made a dreadfull shade


so dreadfully he towards him did pas
forelifting vp aloft his speckled brest
and often bounding on the brused gras
as for great ioyance of his newcome guest
eftsoones he gan aduance his haughtie crest
as chauffed bore his bristles doth vpreare
and shoke his scales to battell readie drest
that made the redcrosse knight nigh quake for feare
as bidding bold defiance to his foeman neare


the knight gan fairely couch his steadie speare
and fiercely ran at him with rigorous might
the pointed steele arriuing rudely theare
his harder hide would neither perce nor bight
but glauncing by forth passed forward right
yet sore amoued with so puissant push
the wrathfull beast about him turned light
and him so rudely passing by did brush
with his long tayle that horse and man to ground did rush


both horse and man vp lightly rose againe
and fresh encounter towards him addrest
but thidle stroke yet backe recoyld in vaine
and found no place his deadly point to rest
exceeding rage enflamd the furious beast
to be auenged of so great despight
for neuer felt his imperceable brest
so wondrous force from hand of liuing wight
yet had he proud the powre of many a puissant knight


then with his wauing wings displayed wyde
himselfe vp high he lifted from the ground
and with strong flight did forcibly diuide
the yielding aire which nigh too feeble found
her flitting partes and element vnsound
to beare so great a weight he cutting way
with his broad sayles about him soared round
at last low stouping with vnweldie sway
snatcht vp both horse man to beare them quite away


long he them bore aboue the subiect plaine
so farre as ewghen bow a shaft may send
till struggling strong did him at last constraine
to let them downe before his flightes end
as hagard hauke presuming to contend
with hardie fowle aboue his hable might
his wearie pounces all in vaine doth spend
to trusse the pray too heauie for his flight
which comming downe to ground does free it selfe by fight


he so disseized of his gryping grosse
the knight his thrillant speare againe assayd
in his brasplated body to embosse
and three mens strength vnto the stroke he layd
wherewith the stiffe beame quaked as affrayd
and glauncing from his scaly necke did glyde
close vnder his left wing then broad displayd
the percing steele there wrought a wound full wyde
that with the vncouth smart the monster lowdly cryde


he cryde as raging seas are wont to rore
when wintry storme his wrathfull wreck does threat
the rolling billowes beat the ragged shore
as they the earth would shoulder from her seat
and greedie gulfe does gape as he would eat
his neighbour element in his reuenge
then gin the blustring brethren boldly threat
to moue the world from off his stedfast henge
and boystrous battell make each other to auenge


the steely head stucke fast still in his flesh
till with his cruell clawes he snatcht the wood
and quite a sunder broke forth flowed fresh
a gushing riuer of blacke goarie blood
that drowned all the land whereon he stood
the streame thereof would driue a watermill
trebly augmented was his furious mood
with bitter sense of his deepe rooted ill
that flames of fire he threw forth frõ his large nosethrill


his hideous tayle then hurled he about
and therewith all enwrapt the nimble thyes
of his frothfomy steed whose courage stout
striuing to loose the knot that fast him tyes
himselfe in streighter bandes too rash implyes
that to the ground he is perforce constraynd
to throw his rider who can quickly ryse
from off the earth with durty bloud distaynd
for that reprochfull fall right fowly he disdaynd


and fiercely tooke his trenchand blade in hand
with which he stroke so furious and so fell
that nothing seemd the puissance could withstand
vpon his crest the hardned yron fell
but his more hardned crest was armd so well
that deeper dint therein it would not make
yet so extremely did the buffe him quell
that from thenceforth he shund the like to take
but when he saw them come he did them still forsake


the knight was wrath to see his stroke beguyld
and smote againe with more outrageous might
but backe againe the sparckling steele recoyld
and left not any marke where it did light
as if in adamant rocke it had bene pight
the beast impatient of his smarting wound
and of so fierce and forcible despight
thought with his wings to stye aboue the ground
but his late wounded wing vnseruiceable found


then full of griefe and anguish vehement
he lowdly brayd that like was neuer heard
and from his wide deuouring ouen sent
a flake of fire that flashing in his beard
him all amazd and almost made affeard
the scorching flame sore swinged all his face
and through his armour all his bodie seard
that he could not endure so cruell cace
but thought his armes to leaue and helmet to vnlace


not that great champion of the antique world
whom famous poetes verse so much doth vaunt
and hath for twelue huge labours high extold
so many furies and sharpe fits did haunt
when him the poysoned garment did enchaunt
with centaures bloud and bloudie verses charmd
as did this knight twelue thousand dolours daunt
whom fyrie steele now burnt that earst him armd
that erst him goodly armd now most of all him harmd


faint wearie sore emboyled grieued brent
with heat toyle wounds armes smart inward fire
that neuer man such mischiefes did torment
death better were death did he oft desire
but death will neuer come when needes require
whom so dismayd when that his foe beheld
he cast to suffer him no more respire
but gan his sturdie sterne about to weld
and him so strongly stroke that to the ground him feld


it fortuned as faire it then befell
behind his backe vnweeting where he stood
of auncient time there was a springing well
from which fast trickled forth a siluer flood
full of great vertues and for medcine good
whylome before that cursed dragon got
that happie land and all with innocent blood
defyld those sacred waues it rightly hot
the well of life ne yet his vertues had forgot


for vnto life the dead it could restore
and guilt of sinfull crimes cleane wash away
those that with sicknesse were infected sore
it could recure and aged long decay
renew as one were borne that very day
both silo this and iordan did excell
and thenglish bath and eke the german spau
ne can cephise nor hebrus match this well
into the same the knight backe ouerthrowen fell


now gan the golden phoebus for to steepe
his fierie face in billowes of the west
and his faint steedes watred in ocean deepe
whiles from their iournall labours they did rest
when that infernall monster hauing kest
his wearie foe into that liuing well
can high aduance his broad discoloured brest
aboue his wonted pitch with countenance fell
and clapt his yron wings as victor he did dwell


which when his pensiue ladie saw from farre
great woe and sorrow did her soule assay
as weening that the sad end of the warre
and gan to highest god entirely pray
that feared chance from her to turne away
with folded hands and knees full lowly bent
all night she watcht ne once adowne would lay
her daintie limbs in her sad dreriment
but praying still did wake and waking did lament


the morrow next gan early to appeare
that titan rose to runne his daily race
but early ere the morrow next gan reare
out of the sea faire titans deawy face
vp rose the gentle virgin from her place
and looked all about if she might spy
her loued knight to moue his manly pace
for she had great doubt of his safety
since late she saw him fall before his enemy


at last she where he vpstarted braue
out of the well wherein he drenched lay
as eagle fresh out of the ocean waue
where he hath left his plumes all hoary gray
and deckt himselfe with feathers youthly gay
like eyas hauke vp mounts vnto the skies
his newly budded pineons to assay
and marueiles at himselfe still as he flies
so new this newborne knight to battell new did rise


whom when the damned feend so fresh did spy
no wonder if he wondred at the sight
and doubted whether his late enemy
it were or other new supplied knight
he now to proue his late renewed might
high brandishing his bright deawburning blade
vpon his crested scalpe so sore did smite
that to the scull a yawning wound it made
the deadly dint his dulled senses all dismaid


i wote not whether the reuenging steele
were hardned with that holy water dew
wherein he fell or sharper edge did feele
or his baptized hands now greater grew
or other secret vertue did ensew
else neuer could the force of fleshly arme
ne molten mettall in his bloud embrew
for till that stownd could neuer wight him harme
by subtilty nor slight nor might nor mighty charme


the cruell wound enraged him so sore
that loud he yelded for exceeding paine
as hundred ramping lyons seemd to rore
whom rauenous hunger did thereto constraine
then gan he tosse aloft his stretched traine
and therewith scourge the buxome aire so sore
that to his force to yeelden it was faine
ne ought his sturdie strokes might stand afore
that high trees ouerthrew and rocks in peeces tore


the same aduauncing high aboue his head
with sharpe intended sting so rude him smot
that to the earth him droue as stricken dead
ne liuing wight would haue him life behot
the mortall sting his angry needle shot
quite through his shield and in his shoulder seasd
where fast it stucke ne would there out be got
the griefe thereof him wondrous sore diseasd
ne might his ranckling paine with patience be appeasd


but yet more mindfull of his honour deare
then of the grieuous smart which him did wring
from loathed soile he can him lightly reare
and stroue to loose the farre infixed sting
which when in vaine he tryde with struggeling
inflamd with wrath his raging blade he heft
andstrooke so strongly that the knotty string
of his huge taile he quite a sunder cleft
fiue ioynts thereof he hewd and but the stump him left


hart cannot thinke what outrage and what cryes
with foule enfouldred smoake and flashing fire
the hellbred beast threw forth vnto the skyes
that all was couered with darknesse dire
then fraught with rancour and engorged ire
he cast at once him to auenge for all
and gathering vp himselfe out of the mire
with his vneuen wings did fiercely fall
vpon his sunnebright shield and gript it fast withall


much was the man encombred with his hold
in feare to lose his weapon in his paw
ne wist yet how his talants to vnfold
nor harder was from cerberus greedie iaw
to plucke a bone then from his cruell claw
to reaue by strength the griped gage away
thrise he assayd it from his foot to draw
and thrise in vaine to draw it did assay
it booted nought to thinke to robbe him of his pray


tho when he saw no power might preuaile
his trustie sword he cald to his last aid
wherewith he fiercely did his foe assaile
and double blowes about him stoutly laid
that glauncing fire out of the yron plaid
as sparckles from the anduile vse to fly
when heauie hammers on the wedge are swaid
therewith at last he forst him to vnty
one of his grasping feete him to defend thereby


the other foot fast fixed on his shield
whenas no strength nor stroks mote him constraine
to loose ne yet the warlike pledge to yield
he smot thereat with all his might and maine
that nought so wondrous puissance might sustaine
vpon the ioynt the lucky steele did light
and made such way that hewd it quite in twaine
the paw yet missed not his minisht might
but hong still on the shield as it at first was pight


for griefe thereof and diuelish despight
from his infernall fournace forth he threw
huge flames that dimmed all the heauens light
enrold in duskish smoke and brimstone blew
as burning aetna from his boyling stew
doth belch out flames and rockes in peeces broke
and ragged ribs of mountaines molten new
enwrapt in coleblacke clouds and filthy smoke
that all the land with stench and heauen with horror choke


the heate whereof and harmefull pestilence
so sore him noyd that forst him to retire
a little backward for his best defence
to saue his bodie from the scorching fire
which he from hellish entrailes did expire
it chaunst eternall god that chaunce did guide
as he recoyled backward in the mire
his nigh forwearied feeble feet did slide
and downe he fell with dread of shame sore terrifide


there grew a goodly tree him faire beside
loaden with fruit and apples rosie red
as they in pure vermilion had beene dide
whereof great vertues ouer all were red
for happie life to all which thereon fed
and life eke euerlasting did befall
great god it planted in that blessed sted
with his almightie hand and did it call
the tree of life the crime of our first fathers fall


in all the world like was not to be found
saue in that soile where all good things did grow
and freely sprong out of the fruitfull ground
as incorrupted nature did them sow
till that dread dragon all did ouerthrow
another like faire tree eke grew thereby
whereof who so did eat eftsoones did know
both good and ill o mornefull memory
that tree through one mans fault hath doen vs all to dy


from that first tree forth flowd as from a well
a trickling streame of balme most soueraine
and daintie deare which on the ground still fell
and ouerflowed all the fertill plaine
as it had deawed bene with timely raine
life and long health that gratious ointment gaue
and deadly woundes could heale and reare againe
the senselesse corse appointed for the graue
into that same he fell which did from death him saue


for nigh thereto the euer damned beast
durst not approch for he was deadly made
and all that life preserued did detest
yet he it oft aduenturd to inuade
by this the drouping daylight gan to fade
and yeeld his roome to sad succeeding night
who with her sable mantle gan to shade
the face of earth and wayes of liuing wight
and high her burning torch set vp in heauen bright


when gentle vna saw the second fall
of her deare knight who wearie of long fight
and faint through losse of bloud moud not at all
but lay as in a dreame of deepe delight
besmeard with pretious balme whose vertuous might
did heale his wounds and scorching heat alay
againe she stricken was with sore affright
and for his safetie gan deuoutly pray
and watch the noyous night and wait for ioyous day


the ioyous day gan early to appeare
and faire aurora from the deawy bed
of aged tithone gan her selfe to reare
with rosie cheekes for shame as blushing red
her golden lockes for haste were loosely shed
about her eares when vna her did marke
clymbe to her charet all with flowers spred
from heauen high to chase the chearelesse darke
with merry note her loud salutes the mounting larke


then freshly vp arose the doughtie knight
all healed of his hurts and woundes wide
and did himselfe to battell readie dight
whose early foe awaiting him beside
to haue deuourd so soone as day he spyde
when now he saw himselfe so freshly reare
as if late fight had nought him damnifyde
he woxe dismayd and gan his fate to feare
nathlesse with wonted rage he him aduaunced neare


and in his first encounter gaping wide
he thought attonce him to haue swallowd quight
and rusht vpon him with outragious pride
who him rencountring fierce as hauke in flight
perforce rebutted backe the weapon bright
taking aduantage of his open iaw
ran through his mouth with so importune might
that deepe emperst his darksome hollow maw
and back retyrd his life bloud forth with all did draw


so downe he fell and forth his life did breath
that vanisht into smoke and cloudes swift
so downe he fell that thearth him vnderneath
did grone as feeble so great load to lift
so downe he fell as an huge rockie clift
whose false foundation waues haue washt away
with dreadfull poyse is from the mayneland rift
and rolling downe great neptune doth dismay
so downe he fell and like an heaped mountaine lay


the knight himselfe euen trembled at his fall
so huge and horrible a masse it seemd
and his deare ladie that beheld it all
durst not approch for dread which she misdeemd
but yet at last when as the direfull feend
she saw not stirre offshaking vaine affright
she nigher drew and saw that ioyous end
then god she praysd and thankt her faithfull knight
that had atchieud so great a conquest by his might


faire vna to the redcrosse knight
betrouthed is with ioy
though false duessa it to barre
her false sleights doe imploy


behold i see the hauen nigh at hand
to which i meane my wearie course to bend
vere the maine shete and beare vp with the land
the which afore is fairely to be kend
and seemeth safe from stormes that may offend
there this faire virgin wearie of her way
must landed be now at her iourneyes end
there eke my feeble barke a while may stay
till merry wind and weather call her thence away


scarsely had phoebus in the glooming east
yet harnessed his firiefooted teeme
ne reard aboue the earth his flaming creast
when the last deadly smoke aloft did steeme
that signe of last outbreathed life did seeme
vnto the watchman on the castle wall
who thereby dead that balefull beast did deeme
and to his lord and ladie lowd gan call
to tell how he had seene the dragons fatall fall


vprose with hastie ioy and feeble speed
that aged sire the lord of all that land
and looked forth to weet if true indeede
those tydings were as he did vnderstand
which whenas true by tryall he out fond
he bad to open wyde his brazen gate
which long time had bene shut and out of hond
proclaymed ioy and peace through all his state
for dead now was their foe which them forrayed late


then gan triumphant trompets sound on hie
that sent to heauen the ecchoed report
of their new ioy and happie victorie
gainst him that had them long opprest with tort
and fast imprisoned in sieged fort
then all the people as in solemne feast
to him assembled with one full consort
reioycing at the fall of that great beast
from whose eternall bondage now they were releast


forth came that auncient lord and aged queene
arayd in antique robes downe to the ground
and sad habiliments right well beseene
a noble crew about them waited round
of sage and sober peres all grauely gownd
whom farre before did march a goodly band
of tall young men all hable armes to sownd
but now they laurell braunches bore in hand
glad signe of victorie and peace in all their land


vnto that doughtie conquerour they came
and him before themselues prostrating low
their lord and patrone loud did him proclame
and at his feet their laurell boughes did throw
soone after them all dauncing on a row
the comely virgins came with girlands dight
as fresh as flowres in medow greene do grow
when morning deaw vpon their leaues doth light
and in their hands sweet timbrels all vpheld on hight


and them before the fry of children young
their wanton sports and childish mirth did play
and to the maydens sounding tymbrels sung
in well attuned notes a ioyous lay
and made delightfull musicke all the way
vntill they came where that faire virgin stood
as faire diana in fresh sommers day
beholds her nymphes enraungd in shadie wood
some wrestle some do run some bathe in christall flood


so she beheld those maydens meriment
with chearefull vew who when to her they came
themselues to ground with gratious humblesse bent
and her adord by honorable name
lifting to heauen her euerlasting fame
then on her head they set a girland greene
and crowned her twixt earnest and twixt game
who in her selferesemblance well beseene
did seeme such as she was a goodly maiden queene


and after all the raskall many ran
heaped together in rude rablement
to see the face of that victorious man
whom all admired as from heauen sent
and gazd vpon with gaping wonderment
but when they came where that dead dragon lay
stretcht on the ground in monstrous large extent
the sight with idle feare did them dismay
ne durst approch him nigh to touch or once assay


some feard and fled some feard and well it faynd
one that would wiser seeme then all the rest
warnd him not touch for yet perhaps remaynd
some lingring life within his hollow brest
or in his wombe might lurke some hidden nest
of many dragonets his fruitfull seed
another said that in his eyes did rest
yet sparckling fire and bad thereof take heed
another said he saw him moue his eyes indeed


one mother when as her foolehardie chyld
did come too neare and with his talants play
halfe dead through feare her litle babe reuyld
and to her gossips gan in counsell say
how can i tell but that his talants may
yet scratch my sonne or rend his tender hand
so diuersly themselues in vaine they fray
whiles some more bold to measure him nigh stand
to proue how many acres he did spread of land


thus flocked all the folke him round about
the whiles that hoarie king with all his traine
being arriued where that champion stout
after his foes defeasance did remaine
him goodly greetes and faire does entertaine
with princely gifts of yuorie and gold
and thousand thankes him yeelds for all his paine
then when his daughter deare he does behold
her dearely doth imbrace and kisseth manifold


and after to his pallace he them brings
with shaumes trompets with clarions sweet
and all the way the ioyous people sings
and with their garments strowes the paued street
whence mounting vp they find purueyance meet
of all that royall princes court became
and all the floore was vnderneath their feet
bespred with costly scarlot of great name
on which they lowly sit and fitting purpose frame


what needs me tell their feast and goodly guize
in which was nothing riotous nor vaine
what needs of daintie dishes to deuize
of comely seruices or courtly trayne
my narrow leaues cannot in them containe
the large discourse of royall princes state
yet was their manner then but bare and plaine
for thantique world excesse and pride did hate
such proud luxurious pompe is swollen vp but late


then when with meates and drinkes of euery kinde
their feruent appetites they quenched had
that auncient lord gan fit occasion finde
of straunge aduentures and of perils sad
which in his trauell him befallen had
for to demaund of his renowmed guest
who then with vttrance graue and countnance sad
from point to point as is before exprest
discourst his voyage long according his request


great pleasure mixt with pittifull regard
that godly king and queene did passionate
whiles they his pittifull aduentures heard
that oft they did lament his lucklesse state
and often blame the too importune fate
that heapd on him so many wrathfull wreakes
for neuer gentle knight as he of late
so tossed was in fortunes cruell freakes
and all the while salt teares bedeawd the hearers cheaks


then said that royall pere in sober wise
deare sonne great beene the euils which ye bore
from first to last in your late enterprise
that i note whether prayse or pitty more
for neuer liuing man i weene so sore
in sea of deadly daungers was distrest
but since now safe ye seised haue the shore
and well arriued are high god be blest
let vs deuize of ease and euerlasting rest


ah dearest lord said then that doughty knight
of ease or rest i may not yet deuize
for by the faith which i to armes haue plight
i bounden am streight after this emprize
as that your daughter can ye well aduize
backe to returne to that great faerie queene
and her to serue six yeares in warlike wize
gainst that proud paynim king that workes her teene
therefore i ought craue pardon till i there haue beene


vnhappie falles that hard necessitie
quoth he the troubler of my happie peace
and vowed foe of my felicitie
ne i against the same can iustly preace
but since that band ye cannot now release
nor doen vndo for vowes may not be vaine
soone as the terme of those six yeares shall cease
ye then shall hither backe returne againe
the marriage to accomplish vowd betwixt you twain


which for my part i couet to performe
in sort as through the world i did proclame
that who so kild that monster most deforme
and him in hardy battaile ouercame
should haue mine onely daughter to his dame
and of my kingdome heire apparaunt bee
therefore since now to thee perteines the same
by dew desert of noble cheualree
both daughter and eke kingdome lo i yield to thee


then forth he called that his daughter faire
the fairest vn his onely daughter deare
his onely daughter and his onely heyre
who forth proceeding with sad sober cheare
as bright as doth the morning starre appeare
out of the east with flaming lockes bedight
to tell that dawning day is drawing neare
and to the world does bring long wished light
so faire and fresh that lady shewd her selfe in sight


so faire and fresh as freshest flowre in may
for she had layd her mournefull stole aside
and widowlike sad wimple throwne away
wherewith her heauenly beautie she did hide
whiles on her wearie iourney she did ride
and on her now a garment she did weare
all lilly white withoutten spot or pride
that seemd like silke and siluer wouen neare
but neither silke nor siluer therein did appeare


the blazing brightnesse of her beauties beame
and glorious light of her sunshyny face
to tell were as to striue against the streame
my ragged rimes are all too rude and bace
her heauenly lineaments for to enchace
ne wonder for her owne deare loued knight
all were she dayly with himselfe in place
did wonder much at her celestiall sight
oft had he seene her faire but neuer so faire dight


so fairely dight when she in presence came
she to her sire made humble reuerence
and bowed low that her right well became
and added grace vnto her excellence
who with great wisedome and graue eloquence
thus gan to say but eare he thus had said
with flying speede and seeming great pretence
came running in much like a man dismaid
a messenger with letters which his message said


all in the open hall amazed stood
at suddeinnesse of that vnwarie sight
and wondred at his breathlesse hastie mood
but he for nought would stay his passage right
till fast before the king he did alight
where falling flat great humblesse he did make
and kist the ground whereon his foot was pight
then to his hands that writ he did betake
which he disclosing red thus as the paper spake


to thee most mighty king of eden faire
her greeting sends in these sad lines addrest
the wofull daughter and forsaken heire
of that great emperour of all the west
and bids thee be aduized for the best
ere thou thy daughter linck in holy band
of wedlocke to that new vnknowen guest
for he already plighted his right hand
vnto another loue and to another land


to me sad mayd or rather widow sad
he was affiaunced long time before
and sacred pledges he both gaue and had
false erraunt knight infamous and forswore
witnesse the burning altars which he swore
and guiltie heauens of his bold periury
which though he hath polluted oft of yore
yet i to them for iudgement iust do fly
and them coniure tauenge this shamefull iniury


therefore since mine he is or free or bond
or false or trew or liuing or else dead
withhold o soueraine prince your hasty hond
from knitting league with him i you aread
ne weene my right with strength adowne to tread
through weakenesse of my widowhed or woe
for truth is strong her rightfull cause to plead
and shall find friends if need requireth soe
so bids thee well to fare thy neither friend nor foe fidessa


when he these bitter byting words had red
the tydings straunge did him abashed make
that still he sate long time astonished
as in great muse ne word to creature spake
at last his solemne silence thus he brake
with doubtfull eyes fast fixed on his guest
redoubted knight that for mine onely sake
thy life and honour late aduenturest
let nought be hid from me that ought to be exprest


what meane these bloudy vowes and idle threats
throwne out from womanish impatient mind
what heauens what altars what enraged heates
here heaped vp with termes of loue vnkind
my conscience cleare with guilty bands would bind
high god be witnesse that i guiltlesse ame
but if your selfe sir knight ye faultie find
or wrapped be in loues of former dame
with crime do not it couer but disclose the same


to whom the redcrosse knight this answere sent
my lord my king be nought hereat dismayd
till well ye wote by graue intendiment
what woman and wherefore doth me vpbrayd
with breach of loue and loyalty betrayd
it was in my mishaps as hitherward
i lately traueild that vnwares i strayd
out of my way through perils straunge and hard
that day should faile me ere i had them all declard


there did i find or rather i was found
of this false woman that fidessa hight
fidessa hight the falsest dame on ground
most false duessa royall richly dight
that easie was tinuegle weaker sight
who by her wicked arts and wylie skill
too false and strong for earthly skill or might
vnwares me wrought vnto her wicked will
and to my foe betrayd when least i feared ill


then stepped forth the goodly royall mayd
and on the ground her selfe prostrating low
with sober countenaunce thus to him sayd
o pardon me my soueraigne lord to show
the secret treasons which of late i know
to haue bene wroght by that false sorceresse
she onely she it is that earst did throw
this gentle knight into so great distresse
that death him did awaite in dayly wretchednesse


and now it seemes that she suborned hath
this craftie messenger with letters vaine
to worke new woe and improuided scath
by breaking of the band betwixt vs twaine
wherein she vsed hath the practicke paine
of this false footman clokt with simplenesse
whom if ye please for to discouer plaine
ye shall him archimago find i ghesse
the falsest man aliue who tries shall find no lesse


the king was greatly moued at her speach
and all with suddein indignation fraight
bad on that messenger rude hands to reach
eftsoones the gard which on his state did wait
attacht that faitor false and bound him strait
who seeming sorely chauffed at his band
as chained beare whom cruell dogs do bait
with idle force did faine them to withstand
and often semblaunce made to scape out of their hand


but they him layd full low in dungeon deepe
and bound him hand and foote with yron chains
and with continuall watch did warely keepe
who then would thinke that by his subtile trains
he could escape fowle death or deadly paines
thus when that princes wrath was pacifide
he gan renew the late forbidden banes
and to the knight his daughter deare he tyde
with sacred rites and vowes for euer to abyde


his owne two hands the holy knots did knit
that none but death for euer can deuide
his owne two hands for such a turne most fit
the housling fire did kindle and prouide
and holy water thereon sprinckled wide
at which the bushy teade a groome did light
and sacred lampe in secret chamber hide
where it should not be quenched day nor night
for feare of euill fates but burnen euer bright


then gan they sprinckle all the posts with wine
and made great feast to solemnize that day
they all perfumde with frankincense diuine
and precious odours fetcht from far away
that all the house did sweat with great aray
and all the while sweete musicke did apply
her curious skill the warbling notes to play
to driue away the dull melancholy
the whiles one sung a song of loue and iollity


during the which there was an heauenly noise
heard sound through all the pallace pleasantly
like as it had bene many an angels voice
singing before theternall maiesty
in their trinall triplicities on hye
yet wist no creature whence that heauenly sweet
proceeded yet each one felt secretly
himselfe thereby reft of his sences meet
and rauished with rare impression in his sprite


great ioy was made that day of young and old
and solemne feast proclaimd throughout the land
that their exceeding merth may not be told
suffice it heare by signes to vnderstand
the vsuall ioyes at knitting of loues band
thrise happy man the knight himselfe did hold
possessed of his ladies hart and hand
and euer when his eye did her behold
his heart did seeme to melt in pleasures manifold


her ioyous presence and sweet company
in full content he there did long enioy
ne wicked enuie ne vile gealosy
his deare delights were able to annoy
yet swimming in that sea of blisfull ioy
he nought forgot how he whilome had sworne
in case he could that monstrous beast destroy
vnto his farie queene backe to returne
the which he shortly did and vna left to mourne


now strike your sailes ye iolly mariners
for we be come vnto a quiet rode
where we must land some of our passengers
and light this wearie vessell of her lode
here she a while may make her safe abode
till she repaired haue her tackles spent
and wants supplide and then againe abroad
on the long voyage whereto she is bent
well may she speede and fairely finish her intent


truth is eternal and the son of heaven
bright effluence of thimmortal ray
chief cherub and chief lamp of that high sacred seven
which guard the throne by night and are its light by day
first of gods darling attributes
thou daily seest him face to face
nor does thy essence fixd depend on giddy circumstance
of time or place
two foolish guides in every sublunary dance
how shall we find thee then in dark disputes
how shall we search thee in a battle gaind
or a weak argument by force maintaind
in dagger contests and thartillery of words
for swords are madmens tongues and tongues are madmens swords
contrived to tire all patience out
and not to satisfy the doubt


but where is even thy image on our earth
for of the person much i fear
since heaven will claim its residence as well as birth
and god himself has said he shall not find it here
for this inferior world is but heavens dusky shade
by dark reverted rays from its reflection made
whence the weak shapes wild and imperfect pass
like sunbeams shot at too far distance from a glass


which all the mimic forms express
though in strange uncouth postures and uncomely dress
so when cartesian artists try
to solve appearances of sight
in its reception to the eye
and catch the living landscape through a scanty light


the figures all inverted show
and colours of a faded hue
here a pale shape with upward footstep treads
and men seem walking on their heads
there whole herds suspended lie
ready to tumble down into the sky
such are the ways illguided mortals go
to judge of things above by things below
disjointing shapes as in the fairy land of dreams
or images that sink in streams
no wonder then we talk amiss
of truth and what or where it is
say muse for thou if any knowst
since the bright essence fled where haunts the reverend ghost


if all that our weak knowledge titles virtue be
high truth the best resemblance of exalted thee
if a mind fixd to combat fate
with those two powerful swords submission and humility
sounds truly good or truly great
ill may i live if the good sancroft in his holy rest
in the divinity of retreat
be not the brightest pattern earth can show
of heavenborn truth below
but foolish man still judges what is best
in his own balance false and light
following opinion dark and blind
that vagrant leader of the mind
till honesty and conscience are clear out of sight


and some to be large ciphers in a state
pleased with an empty swelling to be counted great
make their minds travel oer infinity of space
rapt through the wide expanse of thought
and oft in contradictions vortex caught
to keep that worthless clod the body in one place
errors like this did old astronomers misguide
led blindly on by gross philosophy and pride
who like hard masters taught the sun
through many a heedless sphere to run
many an eccentric and unthrifty motion make
and thousand incoherent journeys take
whilst all thadvantage by it got
was but to light earths inconsiderable spot


the herd beneath who see the weathercock of state
hung loosely on the churchs pinnacle
believe it firm because perhaps the day is mild and still
but when they find it turn with the first blast of fate
by gazing upward giddy grow
and think the church itself does so
thus fools for being strong and numrous known
suppose the truth like all the world their own
and holy sancrofts motion quite irregular appears
because tis opposite to theirs


in vain then would the muse the multitude advise
whose peevish knowledge thus perversely lies
in gathring follies from the wise
rather put on thy anger and thy spite
and some kind power for once dispense
through the dark mass the dawn of so much sense
to make them understand and feel me when i write
the muse and i no more revenge desire
each line shall stab shall blast like daggers and like fire
ah britain land of angels which of all thy sins
say hapless isle although
it is a bloody list we know
has given thee up a dwellingplace to fiends


sin and the plague ever abound
in governments too easy and too fruitful ground
evils which a too gentle king
too flourishing a spring
and too warm summers bring
our british soil is over rank and breeds
among the noblest flowers a thousand poisnous weeds
and every stinking weed so lofty grows
as if twould overshade the royal rose
the royal rose the glory of our morn
but ah too much without a thorn


forgive original mildness this illgovernd zeal
tis all the angry slighted muse can do
in the pollution of these days
no province now is left her but to rail
and poetry has lost the art to praise
alas the occasions are so few
none eer but you
and your almighty master knew


with heavenly peace of mind to bear
free from our tyrant passions anger scorn or fear
the giddy turns of popular rage
and all the contradictions of a poisond age
the son of god pronounced by the same breath
which straight pronounced his death


and though i should but ill be understood
in wholly equalling our sin and theirs
and measuring by the scanty thread of wit
what we call holy and great and just and good
methods in talk whereof our pride and ignorance make use
and which our wild ambition foolishly compares
with endless and with infinite
yet pardon native albion when i say
among thy stubborn sons there haunts that spirit of the jews
that those forsaken wretches who today
revile his great ambassador
seem to discover what they would have done
were his humanity on earth once more
to his undoubted master heavens almighty son


but zeal is weak and ignorant though wondrous proud
though very turbulent and very loud
the crazy composition shows
like that fantastic medley in the idols toes
made up of iron mixt with clay
this crumbles into dust
that moulders into rust
or melts by the first shower away
nothing is fixd that mortals see or know
unless perhaps some stars above be so
and those alas do show
like all transcendent excellence below
in both false mediums cheat our sight
and far exalted objects lessen by their height
thus primitive sancroft moves too high
to be observed by vulgar eye
and rolls the silent year
on his own secret regular sphere
and sheds though all unseen his sacred influence here


necessity thou tyrant conscience of the great
say why the church is still led blindfold by the state
why should the first be ruind and laid waste
to mend dilapidations in the last
and yet the world whose eyes are on our mighty prince
thinks heaven has cancelld all our sins
and that his subjects share his happy influence
follow the model close for so im sure they should
but wicked kings draw more examples than the good
and divine sancroft weary with the weight
of a declining church by faction her worst foe oppressd
finding the mitre almost grown
a load as heavy as the crown
wisely retreated to his heavenly rest


ah may no unkind earthquake of the state
nor hurricano from the crown
disturb the present mitre as that fearful storm of late
which in its dusky march along the plain
swept up whole churches as it list
wrappd in a whirlwind and a mist
like that prophetic tempest in the virgin reign
and swallowd them at last or flung them down
such were the storms good sancroft long has borne
the mitre which his sacred head has worn
was like his masters crown inwreathd with thorn
deaths sting is swallowd up in victory at last
the bitter cup is from him past
fortune in both extremes
though blasts from contrariety of winds
yet to firm heavenly minds
is but one thing under two different names
and even the sharpest eye that has the prospect seen
confesses ignorance to judge between
and must to human reasoning opposite conclude
to point out which is moderation which is fortitude


thus sancroft in the exaltation of retreat
shows lustre that was shaded in his seat
short glimmrings of the prelate glorified
which the disguise of greatness only served to hide
why should the sun alas be proud
to lodge behind a golden cloud
though fringed with evening gold the cloud appears so gay
tis but a lowborn vapour kindled by a ray
at length tis overblown and past
puffd by the peoples spiteful blast
the dazzling glory dims their prostituted sight
no deflowerd eye can face the naked light
yet does this high perfection well proceed
from strength of its own native seed
this wilderness the world like that poetic wood of old
bears one and but one branch of gold
where the blessd spirit lodges like the dove
and which to heavenly soil transplanted will improve
to be as twas below the brightest plant above
for whateer theologic levellers dream
there are degrees above i know
as well as here below
the goddess muse herself has told me so
where high patrician souls dressd heavenly gay
sit clad in lawn of purer woven day
there some highspirited throne to sancroft shall be given
in the metropolis of heaven
chief of the mitred saints and from archprelate here
translated to archangel there


since happy saint since it has been of late
either our blindness or our fate
to lose the providence of thy cares
pity a miserable churchs tears
that begs the powerful blessing of thy prayers
some angel say what were the nations crimes
that sent these wild reformers to our times
say what their senseless malice meant
to tear religions lovely face
strip her of every ornament and grace
in striving to wash off thimaginary paint
religion now does on her deathbed lie
heartsick of a high fever and consuming atrophy
how the physicians swarm to show their mortal skill
and by their college arts methodically kill
reformers and physicians differ but in name
one end in both and the design the same
cordials are in their talk while all they mean
is but the patients death and gain
check in thy satire angry muse
or a more worthy subject choose
let not the outcasts of an outcast age
provoke the honour of my muses rage
nor be thy mighty spirit raisd
since heaven and cato both are pleasd


to purchase kingdoms and to buy renown
are arts peculiar to dissembling france
you mighty monarch nobler actions crown
and solid virtue does your name advance


your matchless courage with your prudence joins
the glorious structure of your fame to raise
with its own light your dazzling glory shines
and into adoration turns our praise


had you by dull succession gaind your crown
cowards are monarchs by that title made
part of your merit chance would call her own
and half your virtues had been lost in shade


but now your worth its just reward shall have
what trophies and what triumphs are your due
who could so well a dying nation save
at once deserve a crown and gain it too


you saw how near we were to ruin brought
you saw thimpetuous torrent rolling on
and timely on the coming danger thought
which we could neither obviate nor shun


britannia strippd of her sole guard the laws
ready to fall romes bloody sacrifice
you straight steppd in and from the monsters jaws
did bravely snatch the lovely helpless prize


nor this is all as glorious is the care
to preserve conquests as at first to gain
in this your virtue claims a double share
which what it bravely won does well maintain


your arm has now your rightful title showd
an arm on which all europes hopes depend
to which they look as to some guardian god
that must their doubtful liberty defend


amazed thy action at the boyne we see
when schomberg started at the vast design
the boundless glory all redounds to thee
the impulse the fight thevent were wholly thine


the brave attempt does all our foes disarm
you need but now give orders and command
your name shall the remaining work perform
and spare the labour of your conquering hand


france does in vain her feeble arts apply
to interrupt the fortune of your course
your influence does the vain attacks defy
of secret malice or of open force


boldly we hence the brave commencement date
of glorious deeds that must all tongues employ
williams the pledge and earnest given by fate
of englands glory and her lasting joy


and thus undoubtedly twill fare
with what unhappy men shall dare
to be successors to these great unknown
on learnings highestablishd throne
censure and pedantry and pride
numberless nations stretching far and wide
shall i foresee it soon with gothic swarms come forth
from ignorances universal north


and with blind rage break all this peaceful government
yet shall the traces of your wit remain
like a just map to tell the vast extent
of conquest in your short and happy reign
and to all future mankind shew
how strange a paradox is true
that men who lived and died without a name
are the chief heroes in the sacred lists of fame


thrice with a prophets voice and prophets power
the muse was called in a poetic hour
and insolently thrice the slighted maid
dared to suspend her unregarded aid
then with that grief we form in spirits divine
pleads for her own neglect and thus reproaches mine
once highly honoured false is the pretence
you make to truth retreat and innocence
who to pollute my shades bringst with thee down
the most ungenerous vices of the town
neer sprung a youth from out this isle before
i once esteemd and loved and favourd more
nor ever maid endured such courtlike scorn
so much in mode so very cityborn
tis with a foul design the muse you send
like a cast mistress to your wicked friend
but find some new address some fresh deceit
nor practise such an antiquated cheat
these are the beaten methods of the stews
stale forms of course all mean deceivers use
who barbarously think to scape reproach
by prostituting her they first debauch


thus did the muse severe unkindly blame
this offering long designd to congreves fame
first chid the zeal as unpoetic fire
which soon his merit forced her to inspire
then call this verse that speaks her largest aid
the greatest compliment she ever made
and wisely judge no power beneath divine
could leap the bounds which part your world and mine
for youth believe to you unseen is fixd
a mighty gulf unpassable betwixt
nor tax the goddess of a mean design
to praise your parts by publishing of mine
that be my thought when some large bulky writ
shows in the front the ambition of my wit
there to surmount what bears me up and sing
like the victorious wren perchd on the eagles wing
this could i do and proudly oer him tower
were my desires but heightend to my power
godlike the force of my young congreves bays
softening the muses thunder into praise
sent to assist an old unvanquishd pride
that looks with scorn on half mankind beside
a pride that well suspends poor mortals fate
gets between them and my resentments weight
stands in the gap twixt me and wretched men
tavert thimpending judgments of my pen


thus i look down with mercy on the age
by hopes my congreve will reform the stage
for never did poetic mind before
produce a richer vein or cleaner ore
the bullion stampd in your refining mind
serves by retail to furnish half mankind
with indignation i behold your wit
forced on me crackd and clippd and counterfeit
by vile pretenders who a stock maintain
from broken scraps and filings of your brain
through native dross your share is hardly known
and by short views mistook for all their own
so small the gains those from your wit do reap
who blend it into follys larger heap
like the suns scatterd beams which loosely pass
when some rough hand breaks the assembling glass
yet want your critics no just cause to rail
since knaves are neer obliged for what they steal
these pad on wits high road and suits maintain
with those they rob by what their trade does gain
thus censure seems that fiery froth which breeds
oer the suns face and from his heat proceeds
crusts oer the day shadowing its partent beam
as ancient natures modern masters dream
this bids some curious praters here below
call titan sick because their sight is so
and well methinks does this allusion fit
to scribblers and the god of light and wit
those who by wild delusions entertain
a lust of rhyming for a poets vein
raise envys clouds to leave themselves in night
but can no more obscure my congreves light
than swarms of gnats that wanton in a ray
which gave them birth can rob the world of day


what northern hive pourd out these foes to wit
whence came these goths to overrun the pit
how would you blush the shameful birth to hear
of those you so ignobly stoop to fear
for ill to them long have i travelld since
round all the circles of impertinence
searchd in the nest where every worm did lie
before it grew a city butterfly
im sure i found them other kind of things
than those with backs of silk and golden wings
a search no doubt as curious and as wise
as virtuosoes in dissecting flies
for could you think the fiercest foes you dread
and court in prologues all are country bred
bred in my scene and for the poets sins
adjournd from tops and grammar to the inns
those beds of dung where schoolboys sprout up beaux
far sooner than the nobler mushroom grows
these are the lords of the poetic schools
who preach the saucy pedantry of rules
those powers the critics who may boast the odds
oer nile with all its wilderness of gods
nor could the nations kneel to viler shapes
which worshippd cats and sacrificed to apes
and can you think the wise forbear to laugh
at the warm zeal that breeds this golden calf


haply you judge these lines severely writ
against the proud usurpers of the pit
stay while i tell my story short and true
to draw conclusions shall be left to you
nor need i ramble far to force a rule
but lay the scene just here at farnham school
last year a lad hence by his parents sent
with other cattle to the city went
where having cast his coat and well pursued
the methods most in fashion to be lewd
returnd a finishd spark this summer down
stockd with the freshest gibberish of the town
a jargon formd from the lost language wit
confounded in that babel of the pit
formd by diseased conceptions weak and wild
sick lust of souls and an abortive child
born between whores and fops by lewd compacts
before the play or else between the acts
nor wonder if from such polluted minds
should spring such short and transitory kinds
or crazy rules to make us wits by rote
last just as long as every cuckoos note
what bungling rusty tools are used by fate
twas in an evil hour to urge my hate


my hate whose lash just heaven has long decreed
shall on a day make sin and folly bleed
when mans ill genius to my presence sent
this wretch to rouse my wrath for ruin meant
who in his idiom vile with graysinn grace
squanderd his noisy talents to my face
named every player on his fingers ends
swore all the wits were his peculiar friends
talkd with that saucy and familiar ease
of wycherly and you and mr bayes
said how a late report your friends had vexd
who heard you meant to write heroics next
for tragedy he knew would lose you quite
and told you so at wills but tother night


thus are the lives of fools a sort of dreams
rendering shades things and substances of names
such high companions may delusion keep
lords are a footboys cronies in his sleep
as a fresh miss by fancy face and gown
renderd the topping beauty of the town
draws every rhyming prating dressing sot
to boast of favours that he never got
of which whoeer lacks confidence to prate
brings his good parts and breeding in debate
and not the meanest coxcomb you can find
but thanks his stars that phillis has been kind
thus prostitute my congreves name is grown
to every lewd pretender of the town
troth i could pity you but this is it
you find to be the fashionable wit
these are the slaves whom reputation chains
whose maintenance requires no help from brains
for should the vilest scribbler to the pit
whom sin and want eer furnishd out a wit
whose name must not within my lines be shown
lest here it live when perishd with his own
should such a wretch usurp my congreves place
and choose out wits who neer have seen his face
ill bet my life but the dull cheat would pass
nor need the lions skin conceal the ass
yes that beaus look that vice those critic ears
must needs be right so well resembling theirs


perish the muses hour thus vainly spent
in satire to my congreves praises meant
in how ill season her resentments rule
whats that to her if mankind be a fool
happy beyond a private muses fate
in pleasing all thats good among the great
where though her elder sisters crowding throng
she still is welcome with her innocent song
whom were my congreve blest to see and know
what poor regards would merit all below
how proudly would he haste the joy to meet
and drop his laurel at apollos feet
here by a mountains side a reverend cave
gives murmuring passage to a lasting wave
tis the worlds watery hourglass streaming fast
time is no more when thutmost drop is past
here on a better day some druid dwelt
and the young muses early favour felt
druid a name she does with pride repeat
confessing albion once her darling seat
far in this primitive cell might we pursue
our predecessors footsteps still in view
here would we singbut ah you think i dream
and the bad world may well believe the same
yes you are all malicious slanders by
while two fond lovers prate the muse and i
since thus i wander from my first intent
nor am that grave adviser which i meant
take this short lesson from the god of bays
and let my friend apply it as he please


beat not the dirty paths where vulgar feet have trod
but give the vigorous fancy room
for when like stupid alchymists you try
to fix this nimble god
this volatile mercury
the subtile spirit all flies up in fume


nor shall the bubbled virtuoso find
more than _fade_ insipid mixture left behind
while thus i write vast shoals of critics come
and on my verse pronounce their saucy doom
the muse like some bright country virgin shows
fallen by mishap among a knot of beaux
they in their lewd and fashionable prate
rally her dress her language and her gait
spend their base coin before the bashful maid
current like copper and as often paid
she who on shady banks has joyd to sleep
near better animals her fathers sheep
shamed and amazed beholds the chattering throng
to think what cattle she is got among
but with the odious smell and sight annoyd
in haste she does thoffensive herd avoid
tis time to bid my friend a long farewell
the muse retreats far in yon crystal cell
faint inspiration sickens as she flies
like distant echo spent the spirit dies
in this descending sheet youll haply find
some short refreshment for your weary mind
nought it contains is common or unclean
and once drawn up is neer let down again


strange to conceive how the same objects strike
at distant hours the mind with forms so like
whether in time deductions broken chain
meets and salutes her sister link again
or haunted fancy by a circling flight
comes back with joy to its own seat at night
or whether dead imaginations ghost
oft hovers where alive it haunted most
or if thoughts rolling globe her circle run
turns up old objects to the soul her sun
or loves the muse to walk with conscious pride
oer the glad scene whence first she rose a bride
be what it will late near yon whispering stream
where her own temple was her darling theme
there first the visionary sound was heard
when to poetic view the muse appeard
such seemd her eyes as when an evening ray
gives glad farewell to a tempestuous day
weak is the beam to dry up natures tears
still every tree the pendent sorrow wears
such are the smiles where drops of crystal show
approaching joy at strife with parting woe
as when to scare thungrateful or the proud
tempests long frown and thunder threatens loud
till the blest sun to give kind dawn of grace
darts weeping beams across heavens watery face
when soon the peaceful bow unstringd is shown
a sign gods dart is shot and wrath oerblown
such to unhallowd sight the muse divine
might seem when first she raised her eyes to mine
what mortal change does in thy face appear
lost youth she cried since first i met thee here
with how undecent clouds are overcast
thy looks when every cause of grief is past
unworthy the glad tidings which i bring
listen while the muse thus teaches thee to sing


as parent earth burst by imprisond winds
scatters strange agues oer mens sickly minds
and shakes the atheists knees such ghastly fear
late i beheld on every face appear
mild dorothea peaceful wise and great
trembling beheld the doubtful hand of fate
mild dorothea whom we both have long
not dared to injure with our lowly song
sprung from a better world and chosen then
the best companion for the best of men
as some fair pile yet spared by zeal and rage
lives pious witness of a better age
so men may see what once was womankind
in the fair shrine of dorotheas mind
you that would grief describe come here and trace
its watery footsteps in dorindas face
grief from dorindas face does neer depart
farther than its own palace in her heart
ah since our fears are fled this insolent expel
at least confine the tyrant to his cell
and if so black the cloud that heavens bright queen
shrouds her still beams how should the stars be seen
thus when dorinda wept joy every face forsook
and grief flung sables on each menial look
the humble tribe mournd for the quickning soul
that furnishd spirit and motion through the whole
so would earths face turn pale and life decay
should heaven suspend to act but for a day
so natures crazed convulsions make us dread
that time is sick or the worlds mind is dead
take youth these thoughts large matter to employ
the fancy furnishd by returning joy
and to mistaken man these truths rehearse
who dare revile the integrity of verse
ah favourite youth how happy is thy lot
but im deceived or thou regardst me not
speak for i wait thy answer and expect
thy just submission for this bold neglect


unknown the forms we the highpriesthood use
at the divine appearance of the muse
which to divulge might shake profane belief
and tell the irreligion of my grief
grief that excused the tribute of my knees
and shaped my passion in such words as these


malignant goddess bane to my repose
thou universal cause of all my woes
say whence it comes that thou art grown of late
a poor amusement for my scorn and hate
the malice thou inspirest i never fail
on thee to wreak the tribute when i rail
fools commonplace thou art their weak ensconcing fort
thappeal of dulness in the last resort
heaven with a parents eye regarding earth
deals out to man the planet of his birth
but sees thy meteor blaze about me shine
and passing oer mistakes thee still for mine
ah should i tell a secret yet unknown
that thou neer hadst a being of thy own
but a wild form dependent on the brain
scattering loose features oer the optic vein
troubling the crystal fountain of the sight
which darts on poets eyes a trembling light
kindled while reason sleeps but quickly flies
like antic shapes in dreams from waking eyes
in sum a glittring voice a painted name
a walking vapour like thy sister fame


but if thou best what thy mad votaries prate
a female power loose governd thoughts create
why near the dregs of youth perversely wilt thou stay
so highly courted by the brisk and gay
wert thou right woman thou shouldst scorn to look
on an abandond wretch by hopes forsook
forsook by hopes ill fortunes last relief
assignd for life to unremitting grief
for let heavens wrath enlarge these weary days
if hope eer dawns the smallest of its rays
time oer the happy takes so swift a flight
and treads so soft so easy and so light
that we the wretched creeping far behind
can scarce thimpression of his footsteps find
smooth as that airy nymph so subtly born
with inoffensive feet oer standing corn
which bowd by evening breeze with bending stalks
salutes the weary traveller as he walks
but oer the afflicted with a heavy pace
sweeps the broad scythe and tramples on his face
down falls the summers pride and sadly shows
natures bare visage furrowd as he mows
see muse what havoc in these looks appear
these are the tyrants trophies of a year
since hope his last and greatest foe is fled
despair and he lodge ever in its stead
march oer the ruind plain with motion slow
still scattering desolation where they go


to thee i owe that fatal bent of mind
still to unhappy restless thoughts inclined
to thee what oft i vainly strive to hide
that scorn of fools by fools mistook for pride
from thee whatever virtue takes its rise
grows a misfortune or becomes a vice
such were thy rules to be poetically great
stoop not to interest flattery or deceit
nor with hired thoughts be thy devotion paid
learn to disdain their mercenary aid
be this thy sure defence thy brazen wall
know no base action at no guilt turn pale
and since unhappy distance thus denies
texpose thy soul clad in this poor disguise
since thy few illpresented graces seem
to breed contempt where thou hast hoped esteem
madness like this no fancy ever seized
still to be cheated never to be pleased
since one false beam of joy in sickly minds
is all the poor content delusion finds
there thy enchantment broke and from this hour
i here renounce thy visionary power
and since thy essence on my breath depends
thus with a puff the whole delusion ends


peruse my leaves thro evry part
and think thou seest my owners heart
scrawld oer with trifles thus and quite
as hard as senseless and as light
exposd to evry coxcombs eyes
but hid with caution from the wise
here you may read dear charming saint
beneath a new receipt for paint
here in beauspelling tru tel deth
there in her own for an el breth
here lovely nymph pronounce my doom
there a safe way to use perfume
here a page filld with billetsdoux
on tother side laid out for shoes
madam i die without your grace
item for half a yard of lace
who that had wit would place it here
for evry peeping fop to jeer
to think that your brains issue is
exposed to thexcrement of his
in powr of spittle and a clout
wheneer he please to blot it out
and then to heighten the disgrace
clap his own nonsense in the place
whoeer expects to hold his part
in such a book and such a heart
if he be wealthy and a fool
is in all points the fittest tool
of whom it may be justly said
hes a gold pencil tippd with lead


my lord to find out who must deal
delivers cards about
but the first knave does seldom fail
to find the doctor out


but then his honour cried gadzooks
and seemd to knit his brow
for on a knave he never looks
but he thinks upon jack how


my lady though she is no player
some bungling partner takes
and wedged in corner of a chair
takes snuff and holds the stakes


dame floyd looks out in grave suspense
for pair royals and sequents
but wisely cautious of her pence
the castle seldom frequents


quoth herries fairly putting cases
id won it on my word
if i had but a pair of aces
and could pick up a third


but weston has a newcast gown
on sundays to be fine in
and if she can but win a crown
twill just new dye the lining


with these is parson swift
not knowing how to spend his time
does make a wretched shift
to deafen them with puns and rhyme


once on a time as old stories rehearse
a friar would need show his talent in latin
but was sorely put to t in the midst of a verse
because he could find no word to come pat in
then all in the place
he left a void space
and so went to bed in a desperate case
when behold the next morning a wonderful riddle
he found it was strangely filld up in the middle
cho let censuring critics then think what they list ont
who would not write verses with such an assistant


this put me the friar into an amazement
for he wisely considerd it must be a sprite
that he came through the keyhole or in at the casement
and it needs must be one that could both read and write
yet he did not know
if it were friend or foe
or whether it came from above or below
howeer it was civil in angel or elf
for he neer could have filld it so well of himself


even so master doctor had puzzled his brains
in making a ballad but was at a stand
he had mixt little wit with a great deal of pains
when he found a new help from invisible hand
then good doctor swift
pay thanks for the gift
for you freely must own you were at a dead lift
and though some malicious young spirit did dot
you may know by the hand it had no cloven foot


when wise lord berkeley first came here
statesmen and mob expected wonders
nor thought to find so great a peer
ere a week past committing blunders
till on a day cut out by fate
when folks came thick to make their court
out slipt a mystery of state
to give the town and country sport
now enters bush with new state airs
his lordships premier minister
and who in all profound affairs
is held as needful as his clyster
with head reclining on his shoulder
he deals and hears mysterious chat
while every ignorant beholder
asks of his neighbour who is that
with this he put up to my lord
the courtiers kept their distance due
he twitchd his sleeve and stole a word
then to a corner both withdrew
imagine now my lord and bush
whispering in junto most profound
like good king phys and good king ush
while all the rest stood gaping round
at length a spark not too well bred
of forward face and ear acute
advanced on tiptoe leand his head
to overhear the grand dispute
to learn what northern kings design
or from whitehall some new express
papists disarmd or fall of coin
for sure thought he it cant be less
my lord said bush a friend and i
disguised in two old threadbare coats
ere mornings dawn stole out to spy
how markets went for hay and oats
with that he draws two handfuls out
the one was oats the other hay
puts this tos excellencys snout
and begs he would the other weigh
my lord seems pleased but still directs
by all means to bring down the rates
then with a congee circumflex
bush smiling round on all retreats
our listener stood awhile confused
but gathering spirits wisely ran fort
enraged to see the world abused
by two such whispering kings of brentford


did ever problem thus perplex
or more employ the female sex
so sweet a passion who would think
jove ever formd to make a stink
the ladies vow and swear theyll try
whether it be a truth or lie
loves fire it seems like inward heat
works in my lord by stool and sweat
which brings a stink from every pore
and from behind and from before
yet what is wonderful to tell it
none but the favourite nymph can smell it
but now to solve the natural cause
by sober philosophic laws
whether all passions when in ferment
work out as anger does in vermin
so when a weasel you torment
you find his passion by his scent
we read of kings who in a fright
though on a throne would fall to shite
beside all this deep scholars know
that the main string of cupids bow
once on a time was an a gut
now to a nobler office put
by favour or desert preferrd
from giving passage to a t
but still though fixd among the stars
does sympathize with human a
thus when you feel a hardbound breech
conclude loves bowstring at full stretch
till the kind looseness comes and then
conclude the bow relaxd again
and now the ladies all are bent
to try the great experiment
ambitious of a regents heart
spread all their charms to catch a fart
watching the first unsavoury wind
some ply before and some behind
my lord on fire amid the dames
fts like a laurel in the flames
the fair approach the speaking part
to try the backway to his heart
for as when we a gun discharge
although the bore be none so large
before the flame from muzzle burst
just at the breech it flashes first
so from my lord his passion broke
he fd first and then he spoke
the ladies vanish in the smother
to confer notes with one another
and now they all agreed to name
whom each one thought the happy dame
quoth neal whateer the rest may think
im sure twas i that smelt the stink
you smell the stink by gd you lie
quoth ross for ill be sworn twas i
ladies quoth levens pray forbear
lets not fall out we all had share
and by the most i can discover
my lords a universal lover


as mastiff dogs in modern phrase are
calld _pompey scipio_ and _caesar_
as pies and daws are often styld
with christian nicknames like a child
as we say _monsieur_ to an ape
without offence to human shape
so men have got from bird and brute
names that would best their nature suit
the _lion eagle fox_ and _boar_
were heroes titles heretofore
bestowd as hiroglyphics fit
to show their valour strength or wit
for what is understood by _fame_
besides the getting of a _name_
but eer since men invented guns
a diffrent way their fancy runs
to paint a hero we inquire
for something that will conquer _fire_
would you describe _turenne_ or _trump_
think of a _bucket_ or a _pump_
are these too lowthen find out grander
call my lord cutts a _salamander_


tis wellbut since we live among
detractors with an evil tongue
who may object against the term
pliny shall prove what we affirm
pliny shall prove and well apply
and ill be judgd by standers by
first then our author has defined
this reptile of the serpent kind
with gaudy coat and shining train
but loathsome spots his body stain
out from some hole obscure he flies
when rains descend and tempests rise
till the sun clears the air and then
crawls back neglected to his den


so when the war has raised a storm
ive seen a snake in human form
all staind with infamy and vice
leap from the dunghill in a trice
burnish and make a gaudy show
become a general peer and beau
till peace has made the sky serene
then shrink into its hole again
all this we grantwhy then look yonder
sure that must be a salamander


further we are by pliny told
this serpent is extremely cold
so cold that put it in the fire
twill make the very flames expire
besides it spues a filthy froth
whether thro rage or lust or both
of matter purulent and white
which happening on the skin to light
and there corrupting to a wound
spreads leprosy and baldness round


so have i seen a batterd beau
by age and claps grown cold as snow
whose breath or touch whereer he came
blew out loves torch or chilld the flame
and should some nymph who neer was cruel
like carleton cheap or famed duruel
receive the filth which he ejects
she soon would find the same effects
her tainted carcass to pursue
as from the salamanders spue
a dismal shedding of her locks
and if no leprosy a pox
then ill appeal to each bystander
if this be not a salamander


mordanto fills the trump of fame
the christian world his deeds proclaim
and prints are crowded with his name


in journeys he outrides the post
sits up till midnight with his host
talks politics and gives the toast


knows every prince in europes face
flies like a squib from place to place
and travels not but runs a race


from paris gazette àlamain
this day arrivd without his train
mordanto in a week from spain


a messenger comes all areek
mordanto at madrid to seek
he left the town above a week


next day the postboy winds his horn
and rides through dover in the morn
mordantos landed from leghorn


mordanto gallops on alone
the roads are with his followers strewn
this breaks a girth and that a bone


his body active as his mind
returning sound in limb and wind
except some leather lost behind


a skeleton in outward figure
his meagre corps though full of vigour
would halt behind him were it bigger


so wonderful his expedition
when you have not the least suspicion
hes with you like an apparition


shines in all climates like a star
in senates bold and fierce in war
a land commander and a tar


heroic actions early bred in
neer to be matchd in modern reading
but by his namesake charles of sweden


the queen has lately lost a part
of her entirelyenglish heart
for want of which by way of botch
she pieced it up again with scotch
blest revolution which creates
divided hearts united states
see how the double nation lies
like a rich coat with skirts of frize
as if a man in making posies
should bundle thistles up with roses
who ever yet a union saw
of kingdoms without faith or law
henceforward let no statesman dare
a kingdom to a ship compare
lest he should call our commonweal
a vessel with a double keel
which just like ours new riggd and mannd
and got about a league from land
by change of wind to leeward side
the pilot knew not how to guide
so tossing faction will oerwhelm
our crazy doublebottomd realm


when cupid did his grandsire jove entreat
to form some beauty by a new receipt
jove sent and found far in a country scene
truth innocence good nature look serene
from which ingredients first the dextrous boy
pickd the demure the awkward and the coy
the graces from the court did next provide
breeding and wit and air and decent pride
these venus cleansd from evry spurious grain
of nice coquet affected pert and vain
jove mixd up all and the best clay employd
then calld the happy composition floyd


venus one day as story goes
but for what reason no man knows
in sullen mood and grave deport
trudged it away to joves high court
and there his godship did entreat
to look out for his best receipt
and make a monster strange and odd
abhorrd by man and every god
jove ever kind to all the fair
nor eer refused a ladys prayer
straight oped scrutoire and forth he took
a neatly bound and wellgilt book
sure sign that nothing enterd there
but what was very choice and rare
scarce had he turnd a page or two
it might be more for aught i knew
but be the matter more or less
mong friends twill break no squares i guess
then smiling to the dame quoth he
heres one will fit you to a t
but as the writing doth prescribe
tis fit the ingredients we provide
away he went and searchd the stews
and every street about the mews
diseases impudence and lies
are found and brought him in a trice
from hackney then he did provide
a clumsy air and awkward pride
from ladys toilet next he brought
noise scandal and malicious thought
these jove put in an old closestool
and with them mixd the vain the fool
but now came on his greatest care
of what he should his paste prepare
for common clay or finer mould
was much too good such stuff to hold
at last he wisely thought on mud
so raised it up and calld it_cludd_
with this the lady well content
low curtseyd and away she went


phoebus now shortning every shade
up to the northern _tropic_ came
and thence beheld a lovely maid
attending on a royal dame


the god laid down his feeble rays
then lighted from his glittring coach
but fencd his head with his own bays
before he durst the nymph approach


under those sacred leaves secure
from common lightning of the skies
he fondly thought he might endure
the flashes of ardelias eyes


the nymph who oft had read in books
of that bright god whom bards invoke
soon knew apollo by his looks
and guessd his business ere he spoke


he in the old celestial cant
confessd his flame and swore by styx
whateer she would desire to grant
but wise ardelia knew his tricks


ovid had warnd her to beware
of strolling gods whose usual trade is
under pretence of taking air
to pick up sublunary ladies


howeer she gave no flat denial
as having malice in her heart
and was resolvd upon a trial
to cheat the god in his own art


hear my request the virgin said
let which i please of all the nine
attend wheneer i want their aid
obey my call and only mine


by vow obligd by passion led
the god could not refuse her prayer
he wayd his wreath thrice oer her head
thrice mutterd something to the air


and now he thought to seize his due
but she the charm already tryd
thalia heard the call and flew
to wait at bright ardelias side


on sight of this celestial _prude_
apollo thought it vain to stay
nor in her presence durst be rude
but made his leg and went away


he hopd to find some lucky hour
when on their queen the muses wait
but pallas owns ardelias power
for vows divine are kept by fate


then full of rage apollo spoke
deceitful nymph i see thy art
and though i cant my gift revoke
ill disappoint its nobler part


let stubborn pride possess thee long
and be thou negligent of fame
with evry muse to grace thy song
mayst thou despise a poets name


of modest poets be thou first
to silent shades repeat thy verse
till fame and echo almost burst
yet hardly dare one line rehearse


and last my vengeance to compleat
may you descend to take renown
prevaild on by the thing you hate
a whig and one that wears a gown


in pity to the emptyng town
some god may fair invented
when nature would invite us down
to be by art prevented


what a corrupted taste is ours
when milk maids in mock state
instead of garlands made of flowers
adorn their pails with plate


so are the joys which nature yields
inverted in may fair
in painted cloth we look for fields
and step in booths for air


here a dog dancing on his hams
and puppets movd by wire
do far exceed your frisking lambs
or song of featherd quire


howeer such verse as yours i grant
would be but too inviting
were fair ardelia not my aunt
or were it worsleys writing


in times of old when time was young
and poets their own verses sung
a verse would draw a stone or beam
that now would overload a team
lead em a dance of many a mile
then rear em to a goodly pile
each number had its diffrent power
heroic strains could build a tower
sonnets and elegies to chloris
might raise a house about two stories
a lyric ode would slate a catch
would tile an epigram would thatch


now poets feel this art is lost
both to their own and landlords cost
not one of all the tuneful throng
can hire a lodging for a song
for jove considerd well the case
that poets were a numerous race
and if they all had power to build
the earth would very soon be filld
materials would be quickly spent
and houses would not give a rent
the god of wealth was therefore made
sole patron of the building trade
leaving to wits the spacious air
with license to build castles there
in right whereof their old pretence
to lodge in garrets comes from thence
there is a worm by phoebus bred
by leaves of mulberry is fed
which unprovided where to dwell
conforms itself to weave a cell
then curious hands this texture take
and for themselves fine garments make
meantime a pair of awkward things
grow to his back instead of wings
he flutters when he thinks he flies
then sheds about his spawn and dies
just such an insect of the age
is he that scribbles for the stage
his birth he does from phoebus raise
and feeds upon imagind bays
throws all his wit and hours away
in twisting up an ill spun play
this gives him lodging and provides
a stock of tawdry shift besides
with the unravelld shreds of which
the under wits adorn their speech
and now he spreads his little fans
for all the muses geese are swans
and borne on fancys pinions thinks
he soars sublimest when he sinks
but scattring round his flyblows dies
whence broods of insectpoets rise


premising thus in modern way
the greater part i have to say
sing muse the house of poet van
in higher strain than we began
van for tis fit the reader know it
is both a herald and a poet
no wonder then if nicely skilld
in each capacity to build
as herald he can in a day
repair a house gone to decay
or by achievements arms device
erect a new one in a trice
and poets if they had their due
by ancient right are builders too
this made him to apollo pray
for leave to buildthe poets way
his prayer was granted for the god
consented with the usual nod


after hard throes of many a day
van was delivered of a play
which in due time brought forth a house
just as the mountain did the mouse
one story high one postern door
and one small chamber on a floor
born like a phoenix from the flame
but neither bulk nor shape the same
as animals of largest size
corrupt to maggots worms and flies
a type of modern wit and style
the rubbish of an ancient pile
so chemists boast they have a power
from the dead ashes of a flower
some faint resemblance to produce
but not the virtue taste nor juice
so modern rhymers strive to blast
the poetry of ages past
which having wisely overthrown
they from its ruins build their own


in times of old when time was young
and poets their own verses sung
a verse would draw a stone or beam
that now would overload a team
lead em a dance of many a mile
then rear em to a goodly pile
each number had its diffrent power
heroic strains could build a tower
sonnets or elegies to chloris
might raise a house about two stories
a lyric ode would slate a catch
would tile an epigram would thatch


but to their own or landlords cost
now poets feel this art is lost
not one of all our tuneful throng
can raise a lodging for a song
for jove considerd well the case
observed they grew a numerous race
and should they build as fast as write
twould ruin undertakers quite
this evil therefore to prevent
he wisely changed their element
on earth the god of wealth was made
sole patron of the building trade
leaving the wits the spacious air
with license to build castles there
and tis conceived their old pretence
to lodge in garrets comes from thence


premising thus in modern way
the better half we have to say
sing muse the house of poet van
in higher strains than we began


van for tis fit the reader know it
is both a herald and a poet
no wonder then if nicely skilld
in both capacities to build
as herald he can in a day
repair a house gone to decay
or by achievements arms device
erect a new one in a trice
and as a poet he has skill
to build in speculation still
great jove he cried the art restore
to build by verse as heretofore
and make my muse the architect
what palaces shall we erect
no longer shall forsaken thames
lament his old whitehall in flames
a pile shall from its ashes rise
fit to invade or prop the skies


jove smiled and like a gentle god
consenting with the usual nod
told van he knew his talent best
and left the choice to his own breast
so van resolved to write a farce
but well perceiving wit was scarce
with cunning that defect supplies
takes a french play as lawful prize
steals thence his plot and evry joke
not once suspecting jove would smoke
and like a wag set down to write
would whisper to himself a _bite_
then from this motley mingled style
proceeded to erect his pile
so men of old to gain renown did
build babel with their tongues confounded
jove saw the cheat but thought it best
to turn the matter to a jest
down from olympus top he slides
laughing as if hed burst his sides
ay thought the god are these your tricks
why then old plays deserve old bricks
and since youre sparing of your stuff
your building shall be small enough
he spake and grudging lent his aid
thexperienced bricks that knew their trade
as being bricks at second hand
now move and now in order stand


the building as the poet writ
rose in proportion to his wit
and first the prologue built a wall
so wide as to encompass all
the scene a wood producd no more
than a few scrubby trees before
the plot as yet lay deep and so
a cellar next was dug below
but this a work so hard was found
two acts it cost him under ground
two other acts we may presume
were spent in building each a room
thus far advancd he made a shift
to raise a roof with act the fift
the epilogue behind did frame
a place not decent here to name


now poets from all quarters ran
to see the house of brother van
looked high and low walkd often round
but no such house was to be found
one asks the watermen hard by
where may the poets palace lie
another of the thames inquires
if he has seen its gilded spires
at length they in the rubbish spy
a thing resembling a goosepie
thither in haste the poets throng
and gaze in silent wonder long
till one in raptures thus began
to praise the pile and builder van


thrice happy poet who mayst trail
thy house about thee like a snail
or harnessd to a nag at ease
take journeys in it like a chaise
or in a boat wheneer thou wilt
canst make it serve thee for a tilt
capacious house tis ownd by all
thourt well contrived tho thou art small
for evry wit in britains isle
may lodge within thy spacious pile
like bacchus thou as poets feign
thy mother burnt art born again
born like a phoenix from the flame
but neither bulk nor shape the same
as animals of largest size
corrupt to maggots worms and flies
a type of modern wit and style
the rubbish of an ancient pile
so chemists boast they have a power
from the dead ashes of a flower
some faint resemblance to produce
but not the virtue taste or juice
so modern rhymers wisely blast
the poetry of ages past
which after they have overthrown
they from its ruins build their own


in ancient time as story tells
the saints would often leave their cells
and stroll about but hide their quality
to try good peoples hospitality


it happend on a winters night
as authors of the legend write
two brother hermits saints by trade
taking their tour in masquerade
came to a village hard by rixham
ragged and not a groat betwixt em
it raind as hard as it could pour
yet they were forced to walk an hour
from house to house wet to the skin
before one soul would let em in
they calld at every door good people
my comrades blind and im a creeple
here we lie starving in the street
twould grieve a bodys heart to seet


no christian would turn out a beast
in such a dreadful night at least
give us but straw and let us lie
in yonder barn to keep us dry
thus in the strollers usual cant
they beggd relief which none would grant
no creature valued what they said
one family was gone to bed
the master bawled out half asleep
you fellows what a noise you keep
so many beggars pass this way
we cant be quiet night nor day
we cannot serve you every one
pray take your answer and be gone
one swore hed send em to the stocks
a third could not forbear his mocks
but bawld as loud as he could roar
youre on the wrong side of the door
one surly clown lookt out and said
ill fling the ppot on your head
you shant come here nor get a sous
you look like rogues would rob a house
cant you go work or serve the king
you blind and lame tis no such thing
thats but a counterfeit sore leg
for shame two sturdy rascals beg
if i come down _ill_ spoil your trick
and cure you both with a good stick


our wandring saints in woful state
treated at this ungodly rate
having thro all the village past
to a small cottage came at last
where dwelt a good old honest yeman
calld thereabout good man philemon
who kindly did the saints invite
in his poor house to pass the night
and then the hospitable sire
bid goody baucis mend the fire
whilst he from out the chimney took
a flitch of bacon off the hook
and freely from the fattest side
cut out large slices to be fryd
which tost up in a pan with batter
and served up in an earthen platter
quoth baucis this is wholesome fare
eat honest friends and never spare
and if we find our victuals fail
we can but make it out in ale


to a small kilderkin of beer
brewd for the good time of the year
philemon by his wifes consent
stept with a jug and made a vent
and having filld it to the brink
invited both the saints to drink
when they had took a second draught
behold a miracle was wrought
for baucis with amazement found
although the jug had twice gone round
it still was full up to the top
as they neer had drunk a drop
you may be sure so strange a sight
put the old people in a fright
philemon whisperd to his wife
these men aresaintsill lay my life
the strangers overheard and said
youre in the rightbut bent afraid
no hurt shall come to you or yours
but for that pack of churlish boors
not fit to live on christian ground
they and their village shall be drownd
whilst you shall see your cottage rise
and grow a church before your eyes


scarce had they spoke when fair and soft
the roof began to mount aloft
aloft rose evry beam and rafter
the heavy wall went clambering after
the chimney widend and grew higher
became a steeple with a spire
the kettle to the top was hoist
and there stood fastened to a joist
but with the upside down to show
its inclination for below
in vain for a superior force
applied at bottom stops its course
doomd ever in suspense to dwell
tis now no kettle but a bell


the wooden jack which had almost
lost by disuse the art to roast
a sudden alteration feels
increasd by new intestine wheels
but what adds to the wonder more
the number made the motion slower
the flyer althot had leaden feet
would turn so quick you scarce could seet
but now stopt by some hidden powers
moves round but twice in twice twelve hours
while in the station of a jack
twas never known to turn its back
a friend in turns and windings tried
nor ever left the chimneys side
the chimney to a steeple grown
the jack would not be left alone
but up against the steeple reard
became a clock and still adherd
and still its love to household cares
by a shrill voice at noon declares
warning the cookmaid not to burn
that roast meat which it cannot turn


the groaningchair began to crawl
like a huge insect up the wall
there stuck and to a pulpit grew
but kept its matter and its hue
and mindful of its ancient state
still groans while tattling gossips prate
the mortar only changd its name
in its old shape a font became
the porringers that in a row
hung high and made a glittring show
to a less noble substance changd
were now but leathern buckets rangd


the ballads pasted on the wall
of chevy chase and english mall
fair rosamond and robin hood
the little children in the wood
enlarged in picture size and letter
and painted lookt abundance better
and now the heraldry describe
of a churchwarden or a tribe
a bedstead of the antique mode
composed of timber many a load
such as our grandfathers did use
was metamorphosd into pews
which yet their former virtue keep
by lodging folk disposed to sleep


the cottage with such feats as these
grown to a church by just degrees
the holy men desired their host
to ask for what he fancied most
philemon having paused a while
replied in complimental style
your goodness more than my desert
makes you take all things in good part
youve raised a church here in a minute
and i would fain continue in it
im good for little at my days
make me the parson if you please


he spoke and presently he feels
his graziers coat reach down his heels
the sleeves new borderd with a list
widend and gatherd at his wrist
but being old continued just
as threadbare and as full of dust
a shambling awkward gait he took
with a demure dejected look
talkt of his offerings tythes and dues
could smoke and drink and read the news
or sell a goose at the next town
decently hid beneath his gown
contrivd to preach old sermons next
changd in the preface and the text
at christnings well could act his part
and had the service all by heart
wishd women might have children fast
and thought whose sow had farrowd last
against dissenters would repine
and stood up firm for right divine
carried it to his equals higher
but most obedient to the squire
found his head filld with many a system
but classic authorshe neer mist em


thus having furbishd up a parson
dame baucis next they playd their farce on
instead of homespun coifs were seen
good pinners edgd with colberteen
her petticoat transformd apace
became black satin flounced with lace
plain goody would no longer down
twas madam in her grogram gown
philemon was in great surprise
and hardly could believe his eyes
amazd to see her look so prim
and she admird as much at him


thus happy in their change of life
were several years this man and wife
when on a day which provd their last
discoursing oer old stories past
they went by chance amidst their talk
to the churchyard to take a walk
when baucis hastily cryd out
my dear i see your forehead sprout
sprout quoth the man whats this you tell us
i hope you dont believe me jealous
but yet methinks i feel it true
and really yours is budding too
naynow i cannot stir my foot
it feels as if twere taking root


description would but tire my muse
in short they both were turnd to yews
old goodman dobson of the green
remembers he the trees has seen
hell talk of them from noon till night
and goes with folk to show the sight
on sundays after evening prayer
he gathers all the parish there
points out the place of either yew
here baucis there philemon grew
till once a parson of our town
to mend his barn cut baucis down
at which tis hard to be believd
how much the other tree was grievd
grew scrubby dyd atop was stunted
so the next parson stubbd and burnt it


in ancient times as story tells
the saints would often leave their cells
and stroll about but hide their quality
to try good peoples hospitality


it happend on a winter night
as authors of the legend write
two brother hermits saints by trade
taking their tour in masquerade
disguisd in tatterd habits went
to a small village down in kent
where in the strollers canting strain
they beggd from door to door in vain
tryd evry tone might pity win
but not a soul would let them in


our wandring saints in woful state
treated at this ungodly rate
having thro all the village past
to a small cottage came at last
where dwelt a good old honest yeman
calld in the neighbourhood philemon
who kindly did these saints invite
in his poor hut to pass the night
and then the hospitable sire
bid goody baucis mend the fire
while he from out the chimney took
a flitch of bacon off the hook
and freely from the fattest side
cut out large slices to be fryd
then steppd aside to fetch em drink
filld a large jug up to the brink
and saw it fairly twice go round
yet what was wonderful they found
twas still replenished to the top
as if they neer had touchd a drop
the good old couple were amazd
and often on each other gazd
for both were frightend to the heart
and just began to cry what _art_
then softly turnd aside to view
whether the lights were burning blue
the gentle pilgrims soon aware ont
told them their calling and their errand
good folk you need not be afraid
we are but saints the hermits said
no hurt shall come to you or yours
but for that pack of churlish boors
not fit to live on christian ground
they and their houses shall be drownd
while you shall see your cottage rise
and grow a church before your eyes


they scarce had spoke when fair and soft
the roof began to mount aloft
aloft rose evry beam and rafter
the heavy wall climbd slowly after
the chimney widend and grew higher
became a steeple with a spire
the kettle to the top was hoist
and there stood fastend to a joist
but with the upside down to show
its inclination for below
in vain for a superior force
applied at bottom stops its course
doomd ever in suspense to dwell
tis now no kettle but a bell


a wooden jack which had almost
lost by disuse the art to roast
a sudden alteration feels
increasd by new intestine wheels
and what exalts the wonder more
the number made the motion slower
the flyer though it had leaden feet
turnd round so quick you scarce could seet
but slackend by some secret power
now hardly moves an inch an hour
the jack and chimney near allyd
had never left each others side
the chimney to a steeple grown
the jack would not be left alone
but up against the steeple reard
became a clock and still adherd
and still its love to household cares
by a shrill voice at noon declares
warning the cookmaid not to burn
that roast meat which it cannot turn
the groaningchair began to crawl
like an huge snail half up the wall
there stuck aloft in public view
and with small change a pulpit grew


the porringers that in a row
hung high and made a glittring show
to a less noble substance changd
were now but leathern buckets rangd
the ballads pasted on the wall
of joan of france and english mall
fair rosamond and robin hood
the little children in the wood
now seemd to look abundance better
improved in picture size and letter
and high in order placd describe
the heraldry of evry tribe


a bedstead of the antique mode
compact of timber many a load
such as our ancestors did use
was metamorphosd into pews
which still their ancient nature keep
by lodging folk disposed to sleep
the cottage by such feats as these
grown to a church by just degrees
the hermits then desired their host
to ask for what he fancyd most
philemon having paused a while
returnd them thanks in homely style
then said my house is grown so fine
methinks i still would call it mine
im old and fain would live at ease
make me the parson if you please


he spoke and presently he feels
his graziers coat fall down his heels
he sees yet hardly can believe
about each arm a pudding sleeve
his waistcoat to a cassock grew
and both assumed a sable hue
but being old continued just
as threadbare and as full of dust
his talk was now of tithes and dues
could smoke his pipe and read the news
knew how to preach old sermons next
vampd in the preface and the text
at christnings well could act his part
and had the service all by heart
wishd women might have children fast
and thought whose sow had farrowd last
against dissenters would repine
and stood up firm for right divine
found his head filld with many a system
but classic authorshe neer mist em


thus having furbishd up a parson

when mother cludd had rose from play
and calld to take the cards away
van saw but seemd not to regard
how miss pickd every painted card
and busy both with hand and eye
soon reard a house two stories high
vans genius without thought or lecture
is hugely turnd to architecture
he viewd the edifice and smiled
vowd it was pretty for a child
it was so perfect in its kind
he kept the model in his mind


but when he found the boys at play
and saw them dabbling in their clay
he stood behind a stall to lurk
and mark the progress of their work
with true delight observed them all
raking up mud to build a wall
the plan he much admired and took
the model in his tablebook
thought himself now exactly skilld
and so resolved a house to build
a real house with rooms and stairs
five times at least as big as theirs
taller than misss by two yards
not a sham thing of play or cards
and so he did for in a while
he built up such a monstrous pile
that no two chairmen could be found
able to lift it from the ground
still at whitehall it stands in view
just in the place where first it grew
there all the little schoolboys run
envying to see themselves outdone


from such deep rudiments as these
van is become by due degrees
for building famed and justly reckond
at court vitruvius the second
no wonder since wise authors show
that best foundations must be low
and now the duke has wisely taen him
to be his architect at blenheim
but raillery at once apart
if this rule holds in every art
or if his grace were no more skilld in
the art of battering walls than building
we might expect to see next year
a mousetrap man chief engineer


well tis as bickerstaff has guest
though we all took it for a jest
partridge is dead nay more he dyd
ere he could prove the good squire lyd
strange an astrologer should die
without one wonder in the sky
not one of all his crony stars
to pay their duty at his hearse
no meteor no eclipse appeard
no comet with a flaming beard
the sun hath rose and gone to bed
just as if partridge were not dead
nor hid himself behind the moon
to make a dreadful night at noon
he at fit periods walks through aries
howeer our earthly motion varies
and twice ayear hell cut th equator
as if there had been no such matter
some wits have wonderd what analogy
there is twixt cobbling and astrology
how partridge made his optics rise
from a shoesole to reach the skies


a list the cobblers temples ties
to keep the hair out of his eyes
from whence tis plain the diadem
that princes wear derives from them
and therefore crowns are nowadays
adornd with golden stars and rays
which plainly shows the near alliance
twixt cobbling and the planets science
besides that slowpaced sign böötes
as tis miscalld we know not who tis
but partridge ended all disputes
he knew his trade and calld it _boots_
the horned moon which heretofore
upon their shoes the romans wore
whose wideness kept their toes from corns
and whence we claim our shoeinghorns
shows how the art of cobbling bears
a near resemblance to the spheres
a scrap of parchment hung by geometry
a great refiner in barometry
can like the stars foretell the weather
and what is parchment else but leather
which an astrologer might use
either for almanacks or shoes


thus partridge by his wit and parts
at once did practise both these arts
and as the boding owl or rather
the bat because her wings are leather
steals from her private cell by night
and flies about the candlelight
so learned partridge could as well
creep in the dark from leathern cell
and in his fancy fly as far
to peep upon a twinkling star
besides he could confound the spheres
and set the planets by the ears
to show his skill he mars could join
to venus in aspect malign
then call in mercury for aid
and cure the wounds that venus made
great scholars have in lucian read
when philip king of greece was dead
his soul and spirit did divide
and each part took a different side
one rose a star the other fell
beneath and mended shoes in hell


thus partridge still shines in each art
the cobbling and stargazing part
and is installd as good a star
as any of the caesars are
triumphant star some pity show
on cobblers militant below
whom roguish boys in stormy nights
torment by pissing out their lights
or through a chink convey their smoke
enclosed artificers to choke
thou high exalted in thy sphere
mayst follow still thy calling there
to thee the bull will lend his hide
by phoebus newly tannd and dryd
for thee they argos hulk will tax
and scrape her pitchy sides for wax
then ariadne kindly lends
her braided hair to make thee ends
the points of sagittarius dart
turns to an awl by heavenly art
and vulcan wheedled by his wife
will forge for thee a paringknife
for want of room by virgos side
shell strain a point and sit astride
to take thee kindly in between
and then the signs will be thirteen


here five feet deep lies on his back
a cobbler starmonger and quack
who to the stars in pure good will
does to his best look upward still
weep all you customers that use
his pills his almanacks or shoes
and you that did your fortunes seek
step to his grave but once aweek
this earth which bears his bodys print
youll find has so much virtue int
that i durst pawn my ears twill tell
whateer concerns you full as well
in physic stolen goods or love
as he himself could when above


now hardly here and there an hackneycoach
appearing showd the ruddy morns approach
now betty from her masters bed had flown
and softly stole to discompose her own
the slipshod prentice from his masters door
had pared the dirt and sprinkled round the floor
now moll had whirld her mop with dextrous airs
prepared to scrub the entry and the stairs
the youth with broomy stumps began to trace
the kennels edge where wheels had worn the place
the smallcoal man was heard with cadence deep
till drownd in shriller notes of chimneysweep
duns at his lordships gate began to meet
and brickdust moll had screamd through half the street
the turnkey now his flock returning sees
duly let out anights to steal for fees
the watchful bailiffs take their silent stands
and schoolboys lag with satchels in their hands


careful observers may foretell the hour
by sure prognostics when to dread a shower
while rain depends the pensive cat gives oer
her frolics and pursues her tail no more
returning home at night youll find the sink
strike your offended sense with double stink
if you be wise then go not far to dine
youll spend in coachhire more than save in wine
a coming shower your shooting corns presage
old aches throb your hollow tooth will rage
sauntering in coffeehouse is dulman seen
he damns the climate and complains of spleen
meanwhile the south rising with dabbled wings
a sable cloud athwart the welkin flings
that swilld more liquor than it could contain
and like a drunkard gives it up again
brisk susan whips her linen from the rope
while the first drizzling shower is borne aslope
such is that sprinkling which some careless quean
flirts on you from her mop but not so clean
you fly invoke the gods then turning stop
to rail she singing still whirls on her mop
not yet the dust had shunnd the unequal strife
but aided by the wind fought still for life
and wafted with its foe by violent gust
twas doubtful which was rain and which was dust
ah where must needy poet seek for aid
when dust and rain at once his coat invade
sole coat where dust cemented by the rain
erects the nap and leaves a cloudy stain
now in contiguous drops the flood comes down
threatening with deluge this _devoted_ town
to shops in crowds the daggled females fly
pretend to cheapen goods but nothing buy
the templar spruce while every spouts abroach
stays till tis fair yet seems to call a coach
the tuckdup sempstress walks with hasty strides
while streams run down her oild umbrellas sides
here various kinds by various fortunes led
commence acquaintance underneath a shed
triumphant tories and desponding whigs
forget their feuds and join to save their wigs
boxd in a chair the beau impatient sits
while spouts run clattering oer the roof by fits
and ever and anon with frightful din
the leather sounds he trembles from within
so when troy chairmen bore the wooden steed
pregnant with greeks impatient to be freed
those bully greeks who as the moderns do
instead of paying chairmen ran them through
laocoon struck the outside with his spear
and each imprisond hero quaked for fear
now from all parts the swelling kennels flow
and bear their trophies with them as they go
filth of all hues and odour seem to tell
what street they saild from by their sight and smell
they as each torrent drives with rapid force
from smithfield to st pulchres shape their course
and in huge confluence joind at snowhill ridge
fall from the conduit prone to holborn bridge


sweeping from butchers stalls dung guts and blood
drownd puppies stinking sprats all drenchd in mud
dead cats and turniptops come tumbling down the flood


whoever pleases to inquire
why yonder steeple wants a spire
the grey old fellow poet joe
the philosophic cause will show
once on a time a western blast
at least twelve inches overcast
reckoning roof weathercock and all
which came with a prodigious fall
and tumbling topsyturvy round
lit with its bottom on the ground
for by the laws of gravitation
it fell into its proper station
this is the little strutting pile
you see just by the churchyard stile
the walls in tumbling gave a knock
and thus the steeple got a shock
from whence the neighbouring farmer calls
the steeple knock the vicar walls


the vicar once aweek creeps in
sits with his knees up to his chin
here cons his notes and takes a whet
till the small ragged flock is met
a traveller who by did pass
observed the roof behind the grass
on tiptoe stood and reard his snout
and saw the parson creeping out
was much surprised to see a crow
venture to build his nest so low
a schoolboy ran untot and thought
the crib was down the blackbird caught
a third who lost his way by night
was forced for safety to alight
and stepping oer the fabric roof
his horse had like to spoil his hoof
warburton took it in his noddle
this building was designd a model
or of a pigeonhouse or oven
to bake one loaf or keep one dove in


then mrs johnson gave her verdict
and every one was pleased that heard it
all that you make this stir about
is but a still which wants a spout
the reverend dr raymond guessd
more probably than all the rest
he said but that it wanted room
it might have been a pigmys tomb
the doctors family came by
and little miss began to cry
give me that house in my own hand
then madam bade the chariot stand
calld to the clerk in manner mild
pray reach that thing here to the child
that thing i mean among the kale
and heres to buy a pot of ale


the clerk said to her in a heat
what sell my masters country seat
where he comes every week from town
he would not sell it for a crown
poh fellow keep not such a pother
in half an hour thoult make another
says nancy i can make for miss
a finer house ten times than this
the dean will give me willow sticks
and joe my apronfull of bricks


now the keen rigour of the winters oer
no hail descends and frost can pinch no more
while other girls confess the genial spring
and laugh aloud or amorous ditties sing
secure from cold their lovely necks display
and throw each useless chafingdish away
why sits my phillis discontented here
nor feels the turn of the revolving year
why on that brow dwell sorrow and dismay
where loves were wont to sport and smiles to play


ah corydon survey the change around
through all the change no wretch like me is found
alas the day when i poor heedless maid
was to your rooms in lincolns inn betrayd
then how you swore how many vows you made
ye listening zephyrs that oerheard his love
waft the soft accents to the gods above
alas the day for o eternal shame
i sold you handkerchiefs and lost my fame


when i forget the favour you bestowd
red herrings shall be spawnd in tyburn road
fleet street transformd become a flowery green
and mass be sung where operas are seen
the wealthy cit and the st jamess beau
shall change their quarters and their joys forego
stockjobbing this to jonathans shall come
at the groom porters that play off his plum


but what to me does all that love avail
if while i doze at home oer porters ale
each night with wine and wenches you regale
my livelong hours in anxious cares are past
and raging hunger lays my beauty waste
on templars spruce in vain i glances throw
and with shrill voice invite them as they go
exposed in vain my glossy ribbons shine
and unregarded wave upon the twine
the week flies round and when my profits known
i hardly clear enough to change a crown


hard fate of virtue thus to be distrest
thou fairest of thy trade and far the best
as fruitmens stalls the summer market grace
and ruddy peaches them as first in place
plumcake is seen oer smaller pastry ware
and ice on that so phillis does appear
in playhouse and in park above the rest
of belles mechanic elegantly drest


and yet crepundia that conceited fair
amid her toys affects a saucy air
and views me hourly with a scornful eye
she might as well with bright cleora vie


with this large petticoat i strive in vain
to hide my folly past and coming pain
tis now no secret she and fifty more
observe the symptoms i had once before
a second babe at wapping must be placed
when i scarce bear the charges of the last


what i could raise i sent a pound of plums
five shillings and a coral for his gums
tomorrow i intend him something more
i sent a frock and pair of shoes before


however you shall home with me tonight
forget your cares and revel in delight
i have in store a pint or two of wine
some cracknels and the remnant of a chine


and now on either side and all around
the weighty shopboards fall and bars resound
each ready sempstress slips her pattens on
and ties her hood preparing to be gone


my pretty dear cuz tho ive roved the town oer
to dispatch in an hour some visits a score
though since first on the wheels ive been every day
at the change at a raffling at church or a play
and the fops of the town are pleased with the notion
of calling your slave the perpetual motion
though oft at your door i have whined out my love
as my knight does grin his at your lady above
yet neer before this though i used all my care
i eer was so happy to meet my dear chair
and since were so near like birds of a feather
lets een as they say set our horses together


by your awkward address youre that thing which should carry
with one footman behind our lover sir harry
by your language i judge you think me a wench
he that makes love to me must make it in french
thou thats drawn by two beasts and carryst a brute
canst thou vainly eer hope ill answer thy suit
though sometimes you pretend to appear with your six
no regard to their colour their sexes you mix
then on the grandpaw youd look very great
with your newfashiond glasses and nasty old seat
thus a beau i have seen strut with a cockd hat
and newly riggd out with a dirty cravat
you may think that you make a figure most shining
but its plain that you have an old cloak for a lining
are those doublegilt nails wheres the lustre of kerry
to set off the knight and to finish the jerry
if you hope ill be kind you must tell me whats due
in georgeslane for you ere ill buckle to


why how now doll diamond youre very alert
is it your french breeding has made you so pert
because i was civil heres a stir with a pox
who is it that values your or your fox
sure tis to her honour he ever should bed
his bloody red hand to her bloody red head
youre proud of your gilding but i tell you each nail
is only just tinged with a rub at her tail
and although it may pass for gold on a ninny
sure we know a bath shilling soon from a guinea
nay her foretops a cheat each morn she does black it
yet ere it be night its the same with her placket
ill neer be run down any more with your cant
your velvet was wore before in a mant
on the back of her mother but now tis much duller
the fire she carries hath changed its colour
those creatures that draw me you never would mind
if youd but look on your own pharaohs lean kine


theyre taken for spectres theyre so meagre and spare
drawn damnably low by your sorrel mare
we know how your lady was on you befriended
youre not to be paid for till the lawsuit is ended
but her bond it is good he need not to doubt
she is two or three years above being out
could my knight be advised he should neer spend his vigour
on one he cant hope of eer making _bigger_


among the numbers who employ
their tongues and pens to give you joy
dear harley generous youth admit
what friendship dictates more than wit
forgive me when i fondly thought
by frequent observations taught
a spirit so informd as yours
could never prosper in amours
the god of wit and light and arts
with all acquired and natural parts
whose harp could savage beasts enchant
was an unfortunate gallant
had bacchus after daphne reeld
the nymph had soon been brought to yield
or had embroiderd mars pursued
the nymph would neer have been a prude
ten thousand footsteps full in view
mark out the way where daphne flew
for such is all the sexs flight
they fly from learning wit and light
they fly and none can overtake
but some gay coxcomb or a rake
how then dear harley could i guess
that you should meet in love success
for if those ancient tales be true
phoebus was beautiful as you
yet daphne never slackd her pace
for wit and learning spoild his face
and since the same resemblance held
in gifts wherein you both excelld
i fancied every nymph would run
from you as from latonas son
then where said i shall harley find
a virgin of superior mind
with wit and virtue to discover
and pay the merit of her lover
this character shall caendish claim
born to retrieve her sexs fame
the chief among the glittering crowd
of titles birth and fortune proud
as fools are insolent and vain
madly aspired to wear her chain
but pallas guardian of the maid
descending to her charges aid
held out medusas snaky locks
which stupified them all to stocks
the nymph with indignation viewd
the dull the noisy and the lewd
for pallas with celestial light
had purified her mortal sight
showd her the virtues all combined
fresh blooming in young harleys mind


terrestrial nymphs by formal arts
display their various nets for hearts
their looks are all by method set
when to be prude and when coquette
yet wanting skill and power to chuse
their only pride is to refuse
but when a goddess would bestow
her love on some bright youth below
round all the earth she casts her eyes
and then descending from the skies
makes choice of him she fancies best
and bids the ravishd youth be blessd
thus the bright empress of the morn
chose for her spouse a mortal born
the goddess made advances first
else what aspiring hero durst
though like a virgin of fifteen
she blushes when by mortals seen
still blushes and with speed retires
when sol pursues her with his fires
diana thus heavens chastest queen
struck with endymions graceful mien
down from her silver chariot came
and to the shepherd ownd her flame
thus caendish as aurora bright
and chaster than the queen of night
descended from her sphere to find
a mortal of superior kind


desponding phyllis was endud
with evry talent of a prude
she trembled when a man drew near
salute her and she turnd her ear
if oer against her you were placed
she durst not look above your waist
shed rather take you to her bed
than let you see her dress her head
in church you hear her thro the crowd
repeat the absolution loud
in church secure behind her fan
she durst behold that monster man
there practisd how to place her head
and bite her lips to make them red
or on the mat devoutly kneeling
would lift her eyes up to the ceiling
and heave her bosom unaware
for neighbring beaux to see it bare


at length a lucky lover came
and found admittance to the dame
suppose all parties now agreed
the writings drawn the lawyer feed
the vicar and the ring bespoke
guess how could such a match be broke
see then what mortals place their bliss in
next morn betimes the bride was missing
the mother screamd the father chid
where can this idle wench be hid
no news of phyl the bridegroom came
and thought his bride had skulkd for shame
because her father used to say
the girl had such a bashful way
now john the butler must be sent
to learn the road that phyllis went
the groom was wishd to saddle crop
for john must neither light nor stop
but find her wheresoeer she fled
and bring her back alive or dead


see here again the devil to do
for truly john was missing too
the horse and pillion both were gone
phyllis it seems was fled with john
old madam who went up to find
what papers phyl had left behind
a letter on the toilet sees
to my much honourd fatherthese
tis always done romances tell us
when daughters run away with fellows
filld with the choicest commonplaces
by others used in the like cases
that long ago a fortuneteller
exactly said what now befell her
and in a glass had made her see
a servingman of low degree
it was her fate must be forgiven
for marriages were made in heaven
his pardon beggd but to be plain
shed dot if twere to do again
thankd god twas neither shame nor sin
for john was come of honest kin
love never thinks of rich and poor
shed beg with john from door to door
forgive her if it be a crime
shell never dot another time
she neer before in all her life
once disobeyd him maid nor wife
one argument she summd up all in
the thing was done and past recalling
and therefore hoped she should recover
his favour when his passions over
she valued not what others thought her
and washis most obedient daughter
fair maidens all attend the muse
who now the wandring pair pursues
away they rode in homely sort
their journey long their money short
the loving couple well bemird
the horse and both the riders tird
their victuals bad their lodgings worse
phyl cried and john began to curse
phyl wishd that she had straind a limb
when first she ventured out with him
john wishd that he had broke a leg
when first for her he quitted peg


but what adventures more befell em
the muse hath now no time to tell em
how johnny wheedled threatend fawnd
till phyllis all her trinkets pawnd
how oft she broke her marriage vows
in kindness to maintain her spouse
till swains unwholesome spoild the trade
for now the surgeon must be paid
to whom those perquisites are gone
in christian justice due to john
when food and raiment now grew scarce
fate put a period to the farce
and with exact poetic justice
for john was landlord phyllis hostess
they keep at stains the old blue boar
are cat and dog and rogue and whore


virtue conceald within our breast
is inactivity at best
but never shall the muse endure
to let your virtues lie obscure
or suffer envy to conceal
your labours for the public weal
within your breast all wisdom lies
either to govern or advise
your steady soul preserves her frame
in good and evil times the same
pale avarice and lurking fraud
stand in your sacred presence awed
your hand alone from gold abstains
which drags the slavish world in chains
him for a happy man i own
whose fortune is not overgrown
and happy he who wisely knows
to use the gifts that heaven bestows
or if it please the powers divine
can suffer want and not repine
the man who infamy to shun
into the arms of death would run
that man is ready to defend
with life his country or his friend


to you whose virtues i must own
with shame i have too lately known
to you by art and nature taught
to be the man i long have sought
had not ill fate perverse and blind
placed you in life too far behind
or what i should repine at more
placed me in life too far before
to you the muse this verse bestows
which might as well have been in prose
no thought no fancy no sublime
but simple topics told in rhyme


three gifts for conversation fit
are humour raillery and wit
the last as boundless as the wind
is well conceived though not defined
for sure by wit is only meant
applying what we first invent
what humour is not all the tribe
of logicmongers can describe
here only nature acts her part
unhelpd by practice books or art
for wit and humour differ quite
that gives surprise and this delight
humour is odd grotesque and wild
only by affectation spoild
tis never by invention got
men have it when they know it not
our conversation to refine
true humour must with wit combine
from both we learn to rally well
wherein french writers most excel
voiture in various lights displays
that irony which turns to praise
his genius first found out the rule
for an obliging ridicule
he flatters with peculiar air
the brave the witty and the fair
and fools would fancy he intends
a satire where he most commends


but as a poor pretending beau
because he fain would make a show
nor can afford to buy gold lace
takes up with copper in the place
so the pert dunces of mankind
wheneer they would be thought refined
because the diffrence lies abstruse
twixt raillery and gross abuse
to show their parts will scold and rail
like porters oer a pot of ale
such is that clan of boisterous bears
always together by the ears
shrewd fellows and arch wags a tribe
that meet for nothing but to gibe
who first run one another down
and then fall foul on all the town
skilld in the horselaugh and dry rub
and calld by excellence the club
i mean your butler dawson car
all special friends and always jar
the mettled and the vicious steed
do not more differ in their breed
nay voiture is as like tom leigh
as rudeness is to repartee


if what you said i wish unspoke
twill not suffice it was a joke
reproach not though in jest a friend
for those defects he cannot mend
his lineage calling shape or sense
if named with scorn gives just offence
what use in life to make men fret
part in worse humour than they met
thus all society is lost
men laugh at one anothers cost
and half the company is teazed
that came together to be pleased
for all buffoons have most in view
to please themselves by vexing you
when jests are carried on too far
and the loud laugh begins the war
you keep your countenance for shame
yet still you think your friend to blame
for though men cry they love a jest
tis but when others stand the test
and would you have their meaning known
they love a jest when tis their own


you wonder now to see me write
so gravely where the subjects light
some part of what i here design
regards a friend of yours and mine
who full of humour fire and wit
not always judges what is fit
but loves to take prodigious rounds
and sometimes walks beyond his bounds
you must although the point be nice
venture to give him some advice
few hints from you will set him right
and teach him how to be polite
bid him like you observe with care
whom to be hard on whom to spare
nor indiscreetly to suppose
all subjects like dan jacksons nose
to study the obliging jest
by reading those who teach it best
for prose i recommend voitures
for verse i speak my judgment yours
hell find the secret out from thence
to rhyme all day without offence
and i no more shall then accuse
the flirts of his illmannerd muse
if he be guilty you must mend him
if he be innocent defend him


know all men by these presents death the tamer
by mortgage has secured the corpse of demar
nor can four hundred thousand sterling pound
redeem him from his prison underground
his heirs might well of all his wealth possesst
bestow to bury him one iron chest
plutus the god of wealth will joy to know
his faithful steward in the shades below
he walkd the streets and wore a threadbare cloak
he dind and suppd at charge of other folk
and by his looks had he held out his palms
he might be thought an object fit for alms
so to the poor if he refusd his pelf
he usd em full as kindly as himself
whereer he went he never saw his betters
lords knights and squires were all his humble debtors
and under hand and seal the irish nation
were forcd to own to him their obligation


he that coud once have half a kingdom bought
in half a minute is not worth a groat
his coffers from the coffin could not save
nor all his intrest keep him from the grave
a golden monument would not be right
because we wish the earth upon him light
oh london tavern thou hast lost a friend
tho in thy walls he neer did farthing spend
he touchd the pence when others touchd the pot
the hand that signd the mortgage paid the shot
old as he was no vulgar known disease
on him could ever boast a powr to seize
but as the gold he weighd grim death in spight
cast in his dart which made three moidores light
and as he saw his darling money fail
blew his last breath to sink the lighter scale
he who so long was current twould be strange
if he should now be cryd down since his change
the sexton shall green sods on thee bestow
alas the sexton is thy banker now
a dismal banker must that banker be
who gives no bills but of mortality


beneath this verdant hillock lies
demar the wealthy and the wise
his heirs that he might safely rest
have put his carcass in a chest
the very chest in which they say
his other self his money lay
and if his heirs continue kind
to that dear self he left behind
i dare believe that four in five
will think his better self alive


you always are making a god of your spouse
but this neither reason nor conscience allows
perhaps you will say tis in gratitude due
and you adore him because he adores you
your arguments weak and so you will find
for you by this rule must adore all mankind


are the guests of this house still doomd to be cheated
sure the fates have decreed they by halves should be treated
in the days of good john if you came here to dine
you had choice of good meat but no choice of good wine
in jonathans reign if you come here to eat
you have choice of good wine but no choice of good meat
o jove then how fully might all sides be blest
wouldst thou but agree to this humble request
put both deans in one or if thats too much trouble
instead of the deans make the deanery double


a bard on whom phoebus his spirit bestowd
resolving tacknowledge the bounty he owed
found out a new method at once of confessing
and making the most of so mighty a blessing
to the god hed be grateful but mortals hed chouse
by making his patron preside in his house
and wisely foresaw this advantage from thence
that the god would in honour bear most of thexpense
so the bard he finds drink and leaves phoebus to treat
with the thoughts he inspires regardless of meat
hence they that come hither expecting to dine
are always fobbd off with sheer wit and sheer wine


right trusty and so forthwe let you know
we are very ill used by you mortals below
for first i have often by chemists been told
though i know nothing ont it is i that make gold
which when you have got you so carefully hide it
that since i was born i hardly have spied it
then it must be allowd that whenever i shine
i forward the grass and i ripen the vine
to me the good fellows apply for relief
without whom they could get neither claret nor beef
yet their wine and their victuals those curmudgeon lubbards
lock up from my sight in cellars and cupboards
that i have an ill eye they wickedly think
and taint all their meat and sour all their drink
but thirdly and lastly it must be allowd
i alone can inspire the poetical crowd
this is gratefully ownd by each boy in the college
whom if i inspire it is not to my knowledge
this every pretender in rhyme will admit
without troubling his head about judgment or wit
these gentlemen use me with kindness and freedom
and as for their works when i please i may read em
they lie open on purpose on counters and stalls
and the titles i view when i shine on the walls


but a comrade of yours that traitor delany
whom i for your sake have used better than any
and of my mere motion and special good grace
intended in time to succeed in your place
on tuesday the tenth seditiously came
with a certain false traitress one stella by name
to the deaneryhouse and on the north glass
where for fear of the cold i never can pass
then and there vi et armis with a certain utensil
of value five shillings in english a pencil
did maliciously falsely and traitrously write
while stella aforesaid stood by with a light
my sister hath lately deposed upon oath
that she stopt in her course to look at them both
that stella was helping abetting and aiding
and still as he writ stood smiling and reading
that her eyes were as bright as myself at noonday
but her graceful black locks were all mingled with grey
and by the description i certainly know
tis the nymph that i courted some ten years ago
whom when i with the best of my talents endued
on her promise of yielding she acted the prude
that some verses were writ with felonious intent
direct to the north where i never once went
that the letters appeard reversed through the pane
but in stellas bright eyes were placed right again
wherein she distinctly could read evry line
and presently guessed the fancy was mine
she can swear to the parson whom oft she has seen
at night between cavan street and college green
now you see why his verses so seldom are shown
the reason is plain they are none of his own
and observe while you live that no man is shy
to discover the goods he came honestly by
if i light on a thought he will certainly steal it
and when he has got it find ways to conceal it
of all the fine things he keeps in the dark
theres scarce one in ten but what has my mark
and let them be seen by the world if he dare
ill make it appear they are all stolen ware
but as for the poem he writ on your sash
i think i have now got him under my lash
my sister transcribed it last night to his sorrow
and the public shall seet if i live till tomorrow
thro the zodiac around it shall quickly be spread
in all parts of the globe where your language is read


he knows very well i neer gave a refusal
when he askd for my aid in the forms that are usual
but the secret is this i did lately intend
to write a few verses on you as my friend
i studied a fortnight before i could find
as i rode in my chariot a thought to my mind
and resolved the next winter for that is my time
when the days are at shortest to get it in rhyme
till then it was lockd in my box at parnassus
when that subtle companion in hopes to surpass us
conveys out my paper of hints by a trick
for i think in my conscience he deals with old nick
and from my own stock provided with topics
he gets to a window beyond both the tropics
there out of my sight just against the north zone
writes down my conceits and then calls them his own
and you like a cully the bubble can swallow
now who but delany that writes like apollo
high treason by statute yet here you object
he only stole hints but the verse is correct
though the thought be apollos tis finely expressd
so a thief steals my horse and has him well dressd
now whereas the said criminal seems past repentance
we phoebus think fit to proceed to his sentence
since delany hath dared like prometheus his sire
to climb to our region and thence to steal fire
we order a vulture in shape of the spleen
to prey on his liver but not to be seen
and we order our subjects of every degree
to believe all his verses were written by me
and under the pain of our highest displeasure
to call nothing his but the rhyme and the measure
and lastly for stella just out of her prime
im too much revenged already by time
in return of her scorn i sent her diseases
but will now be her friend whenever she pleases
and the gifts i bestowd her will find her a lover
though she lives till shes grey as a badger all over


parnassus february the twentyseventh
the poets assembled here on the eleventh
convened by apollo who gave them to know
hed have a vicegerent in his empire below
but declared that no bard should this honour inherit
till the rest had agreed he surpassd them in merit
now this youll allow was a difficult case
for each bard believed hed a right to the place
so finding the assembly grow warm in debate
he put them in mind of his phaethons fate
twas urged to no purpose disputes higher rose
scarce phoebus himself could their quarrels compose
till at length he determined that every bard
should each in his turn be patiently heard
first one who believed he excelld in translation
founds his claim on the doctrine of mans transmigration
since the soul of great milton was given to me
i hope the convention will quickly agree
agree quoth apollo from whence is this fool
is he just come from reading pythagoras at school
begone sir youve got your subscriptions in time
and given in return neither reason nor rhyme
to the next says the god though now i wont chuse you
ill tell you the reason for which i refuse you
loves goddess has oft to her parents complaind
of my favouring a bard who her empire disdaind
that at my instigation a poem you writ
which to beauty and youth preferrd judgment and wit
that to make you a laureate i gave the first voice
inspiring the britons tapprove of my choice
jove sent her to me her power to try
the goddess of beauty what god can deny
she forbids your preferment i grant her desire
appease the fair goddess you then may rise higher
the next that appeard had good hopes of succeeding
for he merited much for his wit and his breeding
twas wise in the britons no favour to show him
he else might expect they should pay what they owe him
and therefore they prudently chose to discard
the patriot whose merits they would not reward
the god with a smile bade his favourite advance
you were sent by astraea her envoy to france
you bend your ambition to rise in the state
i refuse you because you could stoop to be great
then a bard who had been a successful translator
the convention allows me a versificator
says apollo you mention the least of your merit
by your works it appears you have much of my spirit
i esteem you so well that to tell you the truth
the greatest objection against yous your youth
then be not concernd you are now laid aside
if you live you shall certainly one day preside
another low bending apollo thus greets
twas i taught your subjects to walk through the streets
you taught them to walk why they knew it before
but give me the bard that can teach them to soar
whenever he claims tis his right ill confess
who lately attempted my style with success
who writes like apollo has most of his spirit
and therefore tis just i distinguish his merit
who makes it appear by all he has writ
his judgment alone can set bounds to his wit
like virgil correct with his own native ease
but excels even virgil in elegant praise
who admires the ancients and knows tis their due
yet writes in a manner entirely new
though none with more ease their depths can explore
yet whatever he wants he takes from my store
though im fond of his virtues his pride i can see
in scorning to borrow from any but me
it is owing to this that like cynthia his lays
enlighten the world by reflecting my rays
this said the whole audience soon found out his drift
the convention was summond in favour of swift
ireland is now our royal care
we lately fixd our viceroy there
how near was she to be undone
till pious love inspired her son
what cannot our vicegerent do
as poet and as patriot too


let his success our subjects sway
our inspirations to obey
and follow where he leads the way


then study to correct your taste
nor beaten paths be longer traced
no simile shall be begun
with rising or with setting sun
and let the secret head of nile
be ever banishd from your isle
when wretched lovers live on air
i beg youll the chameleon spare
and when youd make a hero grander
forget hes like a salamander


no son of mine shall dare to say
aurora usherd in the day
or ever name the milkyway


you all agree i make no doubt
elijahs mantle is worn out
the bird of jove shall toil no more
to teach the humble wren to soar
your tragic heroes shall not rant
nor shepherds use poetic cant
simplicity alone can grace
the manners of the rural race
theocritus and philips be
your guides to true simplicity


when damons soul shall take its flight
though poets have the secondsight
they shall not see a trail of light


nor shall the vapours upwards rise
nor a new star adorn the skies
for who can hope to place one there
as glorious as belindas hair
yet if his name youd eternize
and must exalt him to the skies


without a star this may be done
so tickell mournd his addison
if annas happy reign you praise
pray not a word of halcyon days
nor let my votaries show their skill
in aping lines from coopers hill
for know i cannot bear to hear
the mimicry of deep yet clear
wheneer my viceroy is addressd
against the phoenix i protest
when poets soar in youthful strains
no phaethon to hold the reins
when you describe a lovely girl
no lips of coral teeth of pearl


cupid shall neer mistake another
however beauteous for his mother
nor shall his darts at random fly
from magazine in celias eye
with woman compounds i am cloyd
which only pleased in biddy floyd
for foreign aid what need they roam
whom fate has amply blest at home
unerring heaven with bounteous hand
has formd a model for your land


whom jove endued with every grace
the glory of the granard race
now destined by the powers divine
the blessing of another line
then would you paint a matchless dame
whom youd consign to endless fame
invoke not cythereas aid
nor borrow from the blueeyed maid
nor need you on the graces call
take qualities from donegal


orourkes noble fare
will neer be forgot
by those who were there
or those who were not


his revels to keep
we sup and we dine
on seven score sheep
fat bullocks and swine


usquebaugh to our feast
in pails was brought up
a hundred at least
and a madder our cup


o there is the sport
we rise with the light
in disorderly sort
from snoring all night


o how was i trickd
my pipe it was broke
my pocket was pickd
i lost my new cloak


im rifled quoth nell
of mantle and kercher
why then fare them well
the deel take the searcher


come harper strike up
but first by your favour
boy give us a cup
ah this hath some savour


orourkes jolly boys
neer dreamt of the matter
till roused by the noise
and musical clatter


they bounce from their nest
no longer will tarry
they rise ready drest
without one avemary


they dance in a round
cutting capers and ramping
a mercy the ground
did not burst with their stamping


the floor is all wet
with leaps and with jumps
while the water and sweat
splishsplash in their pumps


bless you late and early
laughlin oenagin
but my hand you dance rarely
margery grinagin


bring straw for our bed
shake it down to the feet
then over us spread
the winnowing sheet


to show i dont flinch
fill the bowl up again
then give us a pinch
of your sneezing a yean


good lord what a sight
after all their good cheer
for people to fight
in the midst of their beer


they rise from their feast
and hot are their brains
a cubit at least
the length of their skeans


what stabs and what cuts
what clattering of sticks
what strokes on the guts
what bastings and kicks


with cudgels of oak
well hardend in flame
a hundred heads broke
a hundred struck lame


you churl ill maintain
my father built lusk
the castle of slane
and carrick drumrusk


the earl of kildare
and moynalta his brother
as great as they are
i was nurst by their mother


ask that of old madam
shell tell you whos who
as far up as adam
she knows it is true


come down with that beam
if cudgels are scarce
a blow on the weam
or a kick on the ase


when first diana leaves her bed
vapours and steams her looks disgrace
a frowzy dirtycolourd red
sits on her cloudy wrinkled face


but by degrees when mounted high
her artificial face appears
down from her window in the sky
her spots are gone her visage clears


twixt earthly females and the moon
all parallels exactly run
if celia should appear too soon
alas the nymph would be undone


to see her from her pillow rise
all reeking in a cloudy steam
crackd lips foul teeth and gummy eyes
poor strephon how would he blaspheme


the soot or powder which was wont
to make her hair look black as jet
falls from her tresses on her front
a mingled mass of dirt and sweat


three colours black and red and white
so graceful in their proper place
remove them to a different light
they form a frightful hideous face


for instance when the lily slips
into the precincts of the rose
and takes possession of the lips
leaving the purple to the nose


so celia went entire to bed
all her complexion safe and sound
but when she rose the black and red
though still in sight had changed their ground


the black which would not be confined
a more inferior station seeks
leaving the fiery red behind
and mingles in her muddy cheeks


the paint by perspiration cracks
and falls in rivulets of sweat
on either side you see the tracks
while at her chin the conflunts meet


a skilful housewife thus her thumb
with spittle while she spins anoints
and thus the brown meanders come
in trickling streams betwixt her joints


but celia can with ease reduce
by help of pencil paint and brush
each colour to its place and use
and teach her cheeks again to blush


she knows her early self no more
but filld with admiration stands
as other painters oft adore
the workmanship of their own hands


thus after four important hours
celias the wonder of her sex
say which among the heavenly powers
could cause such wonderful effects


venus indulgent to her kind
gave women all their hearts could wish
when first she taught them where to find
white lead and lusitanian dish


love with white lead cements his wings
white lead was sent us to repair
two brightest brittlest earthly things
a ladys face and chinaware


she ventures now to lift the sash
the window is her proper sphere
ah lovely nymph be not too rash
nor let the beaux approach too near


take pattern by your sister star
delude at once and bless our sight
when you are seen be seen from far
and chiefly choose to shine by night


in the pall mall when passing by
keep up the glasses of your chair
then each transported fop will cry
gd dn me jack shes wondrous fair


but art no longer can prevail
when the materials all are gone
the best mechanic hand must fail
where nothings left to work upon


matter as wise logicians say
cannot without a form subsist
and form say i as well as they
must fail if matter brings no grist


and this is fair dianas case
for all astrologers maintain
each night a bit drops off her face
when mortals say shes in her wane


while partridge wisely shows the cause
efficient of the moons decay
that cancer with his poisnous claws
attacks her in the milky way


but gadbury in art profound
from her pale cheeks pretends to show
that swain endymion is not sound
or else that mercurys her foe


but let the cause be what it will
in half a month she looks so thin
that flamsteed can with all his skill
see but her forehead and her chin


yet as she wastes she grows discreet
till midnight never shows her head
so rotting celia strolls the street
when sober folks are all abed


for sure if this be lunas fate
poor celia but of mortal race
in vain expects a longer date
to the materials of her face


when mercury her tresses mows
to think of oil and soot is vain
no painting can restore a nose
nor will her teeth return again


two balls of glass may serve for eyes
white lead can plaister up a cleft
but these alas are poor supplies
if neither cheeks nor lips be left


ye powers who over love preside
since mortal beauties drop so soon
if ye would have us well supplied
send us new nymphs with each new moon


aetatis suae fiftytwo
a reverend dean began to woo
a handsome young imperious girl
nearly related to an earl
her parents and her friends consent
the couple to the temple went
they first invite the cyprian queen
twas answerd she would not be seen
but cupid in disdain could scarce
forbear to bid them kiss his
the graces next and all the muses
were bid in form but sent excuses
juno attended at the porch
with farthing candle for a torch
while mistress iris held her train
the faded bow bedropt with rain
then hebe came and took her place
but showd no more than half her face
whateer these dire forebodings meant
in joy the marriageday was spent
the marriage_day_ you take me right
i promise nothing for the night
the bridegroom drest to make a figure
assumes an artificial vigour
a flourishd nightcap on to grace
his ruddy wrinkled smirking face
like the faint red upon a pippin
half witherd by a winters keeping


and thus set out this happy pair
the swain is rich the nymph is fair
but what i gladly would forget
the swain is old the nymph coquette
both from the goal together start
scarce run a step before they part
no common ligament that binds
the various textures of their minds
their thoughts and actions hopes and fears
less corresponding than their years
the dean desires his coffee soon
she rises to her tea at noon
while the dean goes out to cheapen books
she at the glass consults her looks
while bettys buzzing at her ear
lord what a dress these parsons wear
so odd a choice how could she make
wishd him a colonel for her sake
then on her finger ends she counts
exact to what his age amounts
the dean she heard her uncle say
is sixty if he be a day
his ruddy cheeks are no disguise
you see the crows feet round his eyes
at one she rambles to the shops
to cheapen tea and talk with fops
or calls a council of her maids
and tradesmen to compare brocades
her weighty morning business oer
sits down to dinner just at four
minds nothing that is done or said
her evening work so fills her head
the dean who used to dine at one
is mawkish and his stomachs gone
in threadbare gown would scarce a louse hold
looks like the chaplain of the household
beholds her from the chaplains place
in french brocades and flanders lace
he wonders what employs her brain
but never asks or asks in vain
his mind is full of other cares
and in the sneaking parsons airs
computes that half a parish dues
will hardly find his wife in shoes
canst thou imagine dull divine
twill gain her love to make her fine
hath she no other wants beside
you feed her lust as well as pride
enticing coxcombs to adore
and teach her to despise thee more


if in her coach shell condescend
to place him at the hinder end
her hoop is hoist above his nose
his odious gown would soil her clothes
she drops him at the church to pray
while she drives on to see the play
he like an orderly divine
comes home a quarter after nine
and meets her hasting to the ball
her chairmen push him from the wall
the dean gets in and walks up stairs
and calls the family to prayers
then goes alone to take his rest
in bed where he can spare her best
at five the footmen make a din
her ladyship is just come in
the masquerade began at two
she stole away with much ado
and shall be chid this afternoon
for leaving company so soon
shell say and she may truly sayt
she cant abide to stay out late


but now though scarce a twelvemonth married
poor lady jane has thrice miscarried
the cause alas is quickly guest
the town has whisperd round the jest
think on some remedy in time
the dean you see is past his prime
already dwindled to a lath
no other way but try the bath
for venus rising from the ocean
infused a strong prolific potion
that mixd with acheloüs spring
the horned flood as poets sing
who with an english beauty smitten
ran under ground from greece to britain
the genial virtue with him brought
and gave the nymph a plenteous draught
then fled and left his horn behind
for husbands past their youth to find
the nymph who still with passion burnd
was to a boiling fountain turnd
where childless wives crowd every morn
to drink in acheloüs horn
or bathe beneath the cross their limbs
where fruitful matter chiefly swims
and here the father often gains
that title by anothers pains
hither though much against his grain
the dean has carried lady jane
he for a while would not consent
but vowd his money all was spent
was ever such a clownish reason
and must my lady slip her season
the doctor with a double fee
was bribed to make the dean agree
here all diversions of the place
are proper in my ladys case
with which she patiently complies
merely because her friends advise
his money and her time employs
in music rafflingrooms and toys
or in the crossbath seeks an heir
since others oft have found one there
where if the dean by chance appears
it shames his cassock and his years
he keeps his distance in the gallery
till banishd by some coxcombs raillery
for twould his character expose
to bathe among the belles and beaux


so have i seen within a pen
young ducklings fosterd by a hen
but when let out they run and muddle
as instinct leads them in a puddle
the sober hen not born to swim
with mournful note clucks round the brim
the dean with all his best endeavour
gets not an heir but gets a fever
a victim to the last essays
of vigour in declining days
he dies and leaves his mourning mate
what could he less his whole estate
the widow goes through all her forms
new lovers now will come in swarms
o may i see her soon dispensing
her favours to some broken ensign
him let her marry for his face
and only coat of tarnishd lace
to turn her naked out of doors
and spend her jointure on his whores
but for a parting present leave her
a rooted pox to last for ever


the farmers goose who in the stubble
has fed without restraint or trouble
grown fat with corn and sitting still
can scarce get oer the barndoor sill
and hardly waddles forth to cool
her belly in the neighbouring pool
nor loudly cackles at the door
for cackling shows the goose is poor
but when she must be turnd to graze
and round the barren common strays
hard exercise and harder fare
soon make my dame grow lank and spare
her body light she tries her wings
and scorns the ground and upward springs
while all the parish as she flies
hear sounds harmonious from the skies
such is the poet fresh in pay
the third nights profits of his play
his morning draughts till noon can swill
among his brethren of the quill
with good roast beef his belly full
grown lazy foggy fat and dull
deep sunk in plenty and delight
what poet eer could take his flight
or stuffd with phlegm up to the throat
what poet eer could sing a note
nor pegasus could bear the load
along the high celestial road
the steed oppressd would break his girth
to raise the lumber from the earth


but view him in another scene
when all his drink is hippocrene
his money spent his patrons fail
his credit out for cheese and ale
his twoyears coat so smooth and bare
through every thread it lets in air
with hungry meals his body pined
his guts and belly full of wind
and like a jockey for a race
his flesh brought down to flying case
now his exalted spirit loathes
encumbrances of food and clothes
and up he rises like a vapour
supported high on wings of paper
he singing flies and flying sings
while from below all grubstreet rings


ye wise philosophers explain
what magic makes our money rise
when dropt into the southern main
or do these jugglers cheat our eyes


put in your money fairly told
_presto_ be gonetis here again
ladies and gentlemen behold
heres every piece as big as ten


thus in a basin drop a shilling
then fill the vessel to the brim
you shall observe as you are filling
the pondrous metal seems to swim


it rises both in bulk and height
behold it swelling like a sop
the liquid medium cheats your sight
behold it mounted to the top


in stock three hundred thousand pounds
i have in view a lords estate
my manors all contiguous round
a coachandsix and served in plate


thus the deluded bankrupt raves
puts all upon a desperate bet
then plunges in the southern waves
dipt over head and earsin debt


so by a calenture misled
the mariner with rapture sees
on the smooth oceans azure bed
enamelld fields and verdant trees


with eager haste he longs to rove
in that fantastic scene and thinks
it must be some enchanted grove
and in he leaps and down he sinks


five hundred chariots just bespoke
are sunk in these devouring waves
the horses drownd the harness broke
and here the owners find their graves


like pharaoh by directors led
they with their spoils went safe before
his chariots tumbling out the dead
lay shatterd on the red sea shore


raised up on hopes aspiring plumes
the young adventurer oer the deep
an eagles flight and state assumes
and scorns the middle way to keep


on paper wings he takes his flight
with wax the father bound them fast
the wax is melted by the height
and down the towering boy is cast


a moralist might here explain
the rashness of the cretan youth
describe his fall into the main
and from a fable form a truth


his wings are his paternal rent
he melts the wax at every flame
his credit sunk his money spent
in southern seas he leaves his name


inform us you that best can tell
why in that dangerous gulf profound
where hundreds and where thousands fell
fools chiefly float the wise are drownd


so have i seen from severns brink
a flock of geese jump down together
swim where the bird of jove would sink
and swimming never wet a feather


but i affirm tis false in fact
directors better knew their tools
we see the nations credit crackd
each knave has made a thousand fools


one fool may from another win
and then get off with money stored
but if a sharper once comes in
he throws it all and sweeps the board


as fishes on each other prey
the great ones swallowing up the small
so fares it in the southern sea
the whale directors eat up all


when stock is high they come between
making by secondhand their offers
then cunningly retire unseen
with each a million in his coffers


so when upon a moonshine night
an ass was drinking at a stream
a cloud arose and stopt the light
by intercepting every beam


the day of judgment will be soon
cries out a sage among the crowd
an ass has swallowd up the moon
the moon lay safe behind the cloud


each poor subscriber to the sea
sinks down at once and there he lies
directors fall as well as they
their fall is but a trick to rise


so fishes rising from the main
can soar with moistend wings on high
the moisture dried they sink again
and dip their fins again to fly


undone at play the female troops
come here their losses to retrieve
ride oer the waves in spacious hoops
like lapland witches in a sieve


thus venus to the sea descends
as poets feign but wheres the moral
it shows the queen of love intends
to search the deep for pearl and coral


the sea is richer than the land
i heard it from my grannams mouth
which now i clearly understand
for by the sea she meant the south


thus by directors we are told
pray gentlemen believe your eyes
our oceans coverd oer with gold
look round and see how thick it lies


we gentlemen are your assisters
well come and hold you by the chin
alas all is not gold that glisters
ten thousand sink by leaping in


o would those patriots be so kind
here in the deep to wash their hands
then like pactolus we should find
the sea indeed had golden sands


a shilling in the bath you fling
the silver takes a nobler hue
by magic virtue in the spring
and seems a guinea to your view


but as a guinea will not pass
at market for a farthing more
shown through a multiplying glass
than what it always did before


so cast it in the southern seas
or view it through a jobbers bill
put on what spectacles you please
your guineas but a guinea still


one night a fool into a brook
thus from a hillock looking down
the golden stars for guineas took
and silver cynthia for a crown


the point he could no longer doubt
he ran he leapt into the flood
there sprawld a while and scarce got out
all coverd oer with slime and mud


upon the water cast thy bread
and after many days thoult find it
but gold upon this ocean spread
shall sink and leave no mark behind it


there is a gulf where thousands fell
here all the bold adventurers came
a narrow sound though deep as hell
change alley is the dreadful name


nine times aday it ebbs and flows
yet he that on the surface lies
without a pilot seldom knows
the time it falls or when twill rise


subscribers here by thousands float
and jostle one another down
each paddling in his leaky boat
and here they fish for gold and drown


now buried in the depth below
now mounted up to heaven again
they reel and stagger to and fro
at their wits end like drunken men


meantime secure on garway cliffs
a savage race by shipwrecks fed
lie waiting for the founderd skiffs
and strip the bodies of the dead


but these you say are factious lies
from some malicious torys brain
for where directors get a prize
the swiss and dutch whole millions drain


thus when by rooks a lord is plied
some cully often wins a bet
by venturing on the cheating side
though not into the secret let


while some build castles in the air
directors build them in the seas
subscribers plainly see them there
for fools will see as wise men please


thus oft by mariners are shown
unless the men of kent are liars
earl godwins castles overflown
and palace roofs and steeple spires


mark where the sly directors creep
nor to the shore approach too nigh
the monsters nestle in the deep
to seize you in your passing by


then like the dogs of nile be wise
who taught by instinct how to shun
the crocodile that lurking lies
run as they drink and drink and run


antæus could by magic charms
recover strength wheneer he fell
alcides held him in his arms
and sent him up in air to hell


directors thrown into the sea
recover strength and vigour there
but may be tamed another way
suspended for a while in air


directors for tis you i warn
by long experience we have found
what planet ruled when you were born
we see you never can be drownd


beware nor overbulky grow
nor come within your cullys reach
for if the sea should sink so low
to leave you dry upon the beach


youll owe your ruin to your bulk
your foes already waiting stand
to tear you like a founderd hulk
while you lie helpless on the sand


thus when a whale has lost the tide
the coasters crowd to seize the spoil
the monster into parts divide
and strip the bones and melt the oil


oh may some western tempest sweep
these locusts whom our fruits have fed
that plague directors to the deep
driven from the south sea to the red


may he whom natures laws obey
who lifts the poor and sinks the proud
quiet the raging of the sea
and still the madness of the crowd


but never shall our isle have rest
till those devouring swine run down
the devils leaving the possest
and headlong in the waters drown


the nation then too late will find
computing all their cost and trouble
directors promises but wind
south sea at best a mighty bubble


our set of strollers wandering up and down
hearing the house was empty came to town
and with a license from our good lord mayor
went to one griffith formerly a player
him we persuaded with a moderate bribe
to speak to elrington and all the tribe
to let our company supply their places
and hire us out their scenes and clothes and faces
is not the truth the truth look full on me
i am not elrington nor griffith he
when we perform look sharp among our crew
theres not a creature here you ever knew
the former folks were servants to the king
we humble strollers always on the wing
now for my part i think upon the whole
rather than starve a better man would stroll
stay let me seethree hundred pounds ayear
for leave to act in towntis plaguy dear
now heres a warrant gallants please to mark
for three thirteens and sixpence to the clerk
three hundred pounds were i the price to fix
the public should bestow the actors six
a score of guineas given underhand
for a good word or so we understand
to help an honest lad thats out of place
may cost a crown or so a common case
and in a crew tis no injustice thought
to ship a rogue and pay him not a groat
but in the chronicles of former ages
who ever heard of servants paying wages


i pity elrington with all my heart
would he were here this night to act my part
i told him what it was to be a stroller
how free we acted and had no comptroller
in every town we wait on mr mayor
first get a license then produce our ware
we sound a trumpet or we beat a drum
huzza the schoolboys roar the players are come
and then we cry to spur the bumpkins on
gallants by tuesday next we must be gone
i told him in the smoothest way i could
all this and more yet it would do no good
but elrington tears falling from his cheeks
he that has shone with betterton and wilks
to whom our country has been always dear
who chose to leave his dearest pledges here
owns all your favours here intends to stay
and as a stroller act in every play
and the whole crew this resolution takes
to live and die all strollers for your sakes
not frighted with an ignominious name
for your displeasure is their only shame
a pox on elringtons majestic tone
now to a word of business in our own
gallants next thursday night will be our last
then without fail we pack up for belfast
lose not your time nor our diversion miss
the next we act shall be as good as this


hold hold my good friends for one moment pray stop ye
i return ye my thanks in the name of poor hoppy
hes not the first person who never did write
and yet has been fed by a benefitnight
the custom is frequent on my word i assure ye
in our famed elder house of the hundreds of drury
but then you must know those players still act on
some very good reasons for such benefaction
a deceased poets widow if pretty cant fail
from cibber she holds as a tenant in tail
your emerited actors and actresses too
for what they have done though no more they can do
and sitters and songsters and chetwood and g
and sometimes a poor sufferer in the south sea
a machineman a tirewoman a mute and a spright
have been all kept from starving by a benefitnight
thus for hoppys bright merits at length we have found
that he must have of us ninetynine and one pound
paid to him clear money once every year
and however some think it a little too dear
yet for reasons of state this sum well allow
though we pay the good man with the sweat of our brow
first because by the king to us he was sent
to guide the whole session of this parliament
to preside in our councils both public and private
and so learn by the by what both houses do drive at
when bold b roars and meek m raves
when ash prates by wholesale or beh by halves
when whigs become whims or join with the tories
and to himself constant when a member no more is
but changes his sides and votes and unvotes
as st is dull and with sd who dotes
then up must get hoppy and with voice very low
and with eloquent bow the house he must show
that that worthy member who spoke last must give
the freedom to him humbly most to conceive
that his sentiment on this affair isnt right
that he mightily wonders which way he came byt
that for his part god knows he does such things disown
and so having convinced him he most humbly sits down


for these and more reasons which perhaps you may hear
pounds hundred this night and one hundred this year
and so on we are forced though we sweat out our blood
to make these walls pay for poor hoppys good
to supply with rare diet his pot and his spit
and with richest margoux to wash down a titbit
to wash oft his fine linen so clean and so neat
and to buy him much linen to fence against sweat
all which he deserves for although all the day
he ofttimes is heavy yet all night hes gay
and if he rise early to watch for the state
to keep up his spirits hell sit up as late


thus for these and more reasons as before i did say
hop has got all the money for our acting this play
which makes us poor actors look _je ne sçai quoy_


great cry and little woolis now become
the plague and proverb of the weavers loom
no wool to work on neither weft nor warp
their pockets empty and their stomachs sharp
provoked in loud complaints to you they cry
ladies relieve the weavers or they die
forsake your silks for stuffs nor think it strange
to shift your clothes since you delight in change
one thing with freedom ill presume to tell
the men will like you every bit as well
see i am dressd from top to toe in stuff
and by my troth i think im fine enough
my wife admires me more and swears she never
in any dress beheld me look so clever
and if a man be better in such ware
what great advantage must it give the fair
our wool from lambs of innocence proceeds
silks come from maggots calicoes from weeds


hence tis by sad experience that we find
ladies in silks to vapours much inclined
and what are they but maggots in the mind


for which i think it reason to conclude
that clothes may change our temper like our food
chintzes are gawdy and engage our eyes
too much about the partycolourd dyes
although the lustre is from you begun
we see the rainbow and neglect the sun


how sweet and innocents the country maid
with small expense in native wool arrayd
who copies from the fields her homely green
while by her shepherd with delight shes seen
should our fair ladies dress like her in wool
how much more lovely and how beautiful
without their indian drapery theyd prove
while wool would help to warm us into love
then like the famous argonauts of greece
well all contend to gain the golden fleece


who dares affirm this is no pious age
when charity begins to tread the stage
when actors who at best are hardly savers
will give a night of benefit to weavers
staylet me see how finely will it sound
_imprimis_ from his grace a hundred pound
peers clergy gentry all are benefactors
and then comes in the _item_ of the actors
_item_ the actors freely give a day
the poet had no more who made the play
but whence this wondrous charity in players
they learn it not at sermons or at prayers
under the rose since here are none but friends
to own the truth we have some private ends
since waitingwomen like exacting jades
hold up the prices of their old brocades
well dress in manufactures made at home
equip our kings and generals at the comb
well rig from meath street egypts haughty queen
and antony shall court her in ratteen
in blue shalloon shall hannibal be clad
and scipio trail an irish purple plaid
in drugget drest of thirteen pence ayard
see philips son amidst his persian guard
and proud roxana fired with jealous rage
with fifty yards of crape shall sweep the stage
in short our kings and princesses within
are all resolved this project to begin
and you our subjects when you here resort
must imitate the fashion of the court
o could i see this audience clad in stuff
though moneys scarce we should have trade enough
but chintz brocades and lace take all away
and scarce a crown is left to see the play
perhaps you wonder whence this friendship springs
between the weavers and us playhouse kings
but wit and weaving had the same beginning
pallas first taught us poetry and spinning
and next observe how this alliance fits
for weavers now are just as poor as wits
their brother quillmen workers for the stage
for sorry stuff can get a crown a page
but weavers will be kinder to the players
and sell for twenty pence a yard of theirs
and to your knowledge there is often less in
the poets wit than in the players dressing


the muses whom the richest silks array
refuse to fling their shining gowns away
the pencil clothes the nine in bright brocades
and gives each colour to the pictured maids
far above mortal dress the sisters shine
pride in their indian robes and must be fine
and shall two bards in concert rhyme and huff
and fret these muses with their playhouse stuff
the player in mimic piety may storm
deplore the comb and bid her heroes arm
the arbitrary mob in paltry rage
may curse the belles and chintzes of the age
yet still the artist worm her silk shall share
and spin her thread of life in service of the fair


the cotton plant whom satire cannot blast
shall bloom the favourite of these realms and last
like yours ye fair her fame from censure grows
prevails in charms and glares above her foes
your injured plant shall meet a loud defence
and be the emblem of your innocence


some bard perhaps whose landlord was a weaver
pennd the low prologue to return a favour
some neighbour wit that would be in the vogue
workd with his friend and wove the epilogue
who weaves the chaplet or provides the bays
for such woolgathering sonnetteers as these
hence then ye homespun witlings that persuade
miss chloe to the fashion of her maid
shall the wide hoop that standard of the town
thus act subservient to a poplin gown
whod smell of wool all over tis enough
the under petticoat be made of stuff


lord to be wrapt in flannel just in may
when the fields dressd in flowers appear so gay
and shall not miss be flowerd as well as they


in what weak colours would the plaid appear
workd to a quilt or studded in a chair
the skin that vies with silk would fret with stuff
or who could bear in bed a thing so rough
ye knowing fair how eminent that bed
where the chintz diamonds with the silken thread
where rustling curtains call the curious eye
and boast the streaks and paintings of the sky
of flocks theyd have your milky ticking full
and all this for the benefit of wool
but where say they shall we bestow these weavers
that spread our streets and are such piteous cravers
the silkworms brittle beings prone to fate
demand their care to make their webs complete
these may they tend their promises receive
we cannot pay too much for what they give


thalia tell in sober lays
how george nim dan dean pass their days
and should our gaulstowns wit grow fallow
yet _neget quis carmina gallo_
here by the way by gallus mean i
not sheridan but friend delany
begin my muse first from our bowers
we sally forth at different hours
at seven the dean in nightgown drest
goes round the house to wake the rest
at nine grave nim and george facetious
go to the dean to read lucretius
at ten my lady comes and hectors
and kisses george and ends our lectures
and when she has him by the neck fast
hauls him and scolds us down to breakfast
we squander there an hour or more
and then all hands boys to the oar
all heteroclite dan except
who never time nor order kept


but by peculiar whimseys drawn
peeps in the ponds to look for spawn
oersees the work or dragon rows
or mars a text or mends his hose
orbut proceed we in our journal
at two or after we return all
from the four elements assembling
warnd by the bell all folks come trembling
from airy garrets some descend
some from the lakes remotest end
my lord and dean the fire forsake
dan leaves the earthy spade and rake
the loiterers quake no corner hides them
and lady betty soundly chides them
now water brought and dinner done
with church and king the ladies gone
not reckoning half an hour we pass
in talking oer a moderate glass
dan growing drowsy like a thief
steals off to doze away his beef
and this must pass for reading hammond
while george and dean go to backgammon
george nim and dean set out at four
and then again boys to the oar
but when the sun goes to the deep
not to disturb him in his sleep
or make a rumbling oer his head
his candle out and he abed
we watch his motions to a minute
and leave the flood when he goes in it


now stinted in the shortening day
we go to prayers and then to play
till supper comes and after that
we sit an hour to drink and chat
tis latethe old and younger pairs
by adam lighted walk up stairs
the weary dean goes to his chamber
and nim and dan to garret clamber
so when the circle we have run
the curtain falls and all is done
i might have mentiond several facts
like episodes between the acts
and tell who loses and who wins
who gets a cold who breaks his shins
how dan caught nothing in his net
and how the boat was overset
for brevity i have retrenchd
how in the lake the dean was drenchd
it would be an exploit to brag on
how valiant george rode oer the dragon
how steady in the storm he sat
and saved his oar but lost his hat
how nim no hunter eer could match him
still brings us hares when he can catch em


how skilfully dan mends his nets
how fortune fails him when he sets
or how the dean delights to vex
the ladies and lampoon their sex
i might have told how oft dean perceval
displays his pedantry unmerciful
how haughtily he cocks his nose
to tell what every schoolboy knows
and with his finger and his thumb
explaining strikes opposers dumb
but now there needs no more be said ont
nor how his wife that female pedant
shews all her secrets of housekeeping
for candles how she trucks her dripping
was forced to send three miles for yeast
to brew her ale and raise her paste


tells everything that you can think of
how she cured charley of the chincough
what gave her brats and pigs the measles
and how her doves were killed by weasels
how jowler howld and what a fright
she had with dreams the other night
but now since i have gone so far on
a word or two of lord chief baron
and tell how little weight he sets
on all whig papers and gazettes
but for the politics of pue
thinks every syllable is true
and since he owns the king of sweden
is dead at last without evading
now all his hopes are in the czar
why muscovy is not so far


down the black sea and up the straits
and in a month hes at your gates
perhaps from what the packet brings
by christmas we shall see strange things
why should i tell of ponds and drains
what carps we met with for our pains
of sparrows tamed and nuts innumerable
to choke the girls and to consume a rabble
but you who are a scholar know
how transient all things are below
how prone to change is human life
last night arrived clem and his wife
this grand event has broke our measures
their reign began with cruel seizures
the dean must with his quilt supply
the bed in which those tyrants lie
nim lost his wigblock dan his jordan
my lady says she cant afford one
george is half scared out of his wits
for clem gets all the dainty bits
henceforth expect a different survey
this house will soon turn topsyturvy
they talk of farther alterations
which causes many speculations


would you that delville i describe
believe me sir i will not gibe
for who would be satirical
upon a thing so very small
you scarce upon the borders enter
before youre at the very centre
a single crow can make it night
when oer your farm she takes her flight
yet in this narrow compass we
observe a vast variety
both walks walls meadows and parterres
windows and doors and rooms and stairs
and hills and dales and woods and fields
and hay and grass and corn it yields
all to your haggard brought so cheap in
without the mowing or the reaping
a razor though to sayt im loth
would shave you and your meadows both
though smalls the farm yet heres a house
full large to entertain a mouse
but where a rat is dreaded more
than savage caledonian boar
for if its enterd by a rat
there is no room to bring a cat
a little rivulet seems to steal
down through a thing you call a vale
like tears adown a wrinkled cheek
like rain along a blade of leek
and this you call your sweet meander
which might be suckd up by a gander
could he but force his nether bill
to scoop the channel of the rill
for sure youd make a mighty clutter
were it as big as city gutter
next come i to your kitchen garden
where one poor mouse would fare but hard in
and round this garden is a walk
no longer than a tailors chalk
thus i compare what space is in it
a snail creeps round it in a minute
one lettuce makes a shift to squeeze
up through a tuft you call your trees
and once a year a single rose
peeps from the bud but never blows
in vain then you expect its bloom
it cannot blow for want of room
in short in all your boasted seat
theres nothing but yourself thats great


a bard grown desirous of saving his pelf
built a house he was sure would hold none but himself
this enraged god apollo who mercury sent
and bid him go ask what his votary meant
some foe to my empire has been his adviser
tis of dreadful portent when a poet turns miser
tell him hermes from me tell that subject of mine
i have sworn by the styx to defeat his design
for wherever he lives the muses shall reign
and the muses he knows have a numerous train


lo from the top of yonder cliff that shrouds
its airy head amid the azure clouds
hangs a huge fragment destitute of props
prone on the wave the rocky ruin drops
with hoarse rebuff the swelling seas rebound
from shore to shore the rocks return the sound
the dreadful murmur heavens high convex cleaves
and neptune shrinks beneath his subject waves
for long the whirling winds and beating tides
had scoopd a vault into its nether sides
now yields the base the summits nod now urge
their headlong course and lash the sounding surge
not louder noise could shake the guilty world
when jove heapd mountains upon mountains hurld
retorting pelion from his dread abode
to crush earths rebel sons beneath the load
oft too with hideous yawn the cavern wide
presents an orifice on either side
a dismal orifice from sea to sea
extended pervious to the god of day
uncouthly joind the rocks stupendous form
an arch the ruin of a future storm
high on the cliff their nests the woodquests make
and seacalves stable in the oozy lake
but when bleak winter with his sullen train
awakes the winds to vex the watery plain
when oer the craggy steep without control
big with the blast the raging billows roll
not towns beleaguerd not the flaming brand
darted from heaven by joves avenging hand
oft as on impious men his wrath he pours
humbles their pride and blasts their gilded towers
equal the tumult of this wild uproar
waves rush oer waves rebellows shore to shore
the neighbouring race though wont to brave the shocks
of angry seas and run along the rocks
now pale with terror while the ocean foams
fly far and wide nor trust their native homes
the goats while pendent from the mountain top
the witherd herb improvident they crop
washd down the precipice with sudden sweep
leave their sweet lives beneath thunfathomd deep
the frighted fisher with desponding eyes
though safe yet trembling in the harbour lies
nor hoping to behold the skies serene
wearies with vows the monarch of the main


come be content since out it must
for stella has betrayd her trust
and whispering charged me not to say
that mr ford was born today
or if at last i needs must blab it
according to my usual habit
she bid me with a serious face
be sure conceal the time and place
and not my compliment to spoil
by calling this your native soil
or vex the ladies when they knew
that you are turning fortytwo
but if these topics shall appear
strong arguments to keep you here
i think though you judge hardly of it
good manners must give place to profit


the nymphs with whom you first began
are each become a harridan
and montague so far decayd
her lovers now must all be paid
and every belle that since arose
has her contemporary beaux
your former comrades once so bright
with whom you toasted half the night
of rheumatism and pox complain
and bid adieu to dear champaign
your great protectors once in power
are now in exile or the tower
your foes triumphant oer the laws
who hate your person and your cause
if once they get you on the spot
you must be guilty of the plot
for true or false theyll neer inquire
but use you ten times worse than prior
in london what would you do there
can you my friend with patience bear
nay would it not your passion raise
worse than a pun or irish phrase
to see a scoundrel strut and hector
a footboy to some rogue director
to look on vice triumphant round
and virtue trampled on the ground
observe where bloody stands
with torturing engines in his hands
hear him blaspheme and swear and rail
threatening the pillory and jail
if this you think a pleasing scene
to london straight return again
where you have told us from experience
are swarms of bugs and presbyterians


i thought my very spleen would burst
when fortune hither drove me first
was full as hard to please as you
nor persons names nor places knew
but now i act as other folk
like prisoners when their gaol is broke


if you have london still at heart
well make a small one here by art
the difference is not much between
st jamess park and stephens green
and dawson street will serve as well
to lead you thither as pall mall
nor want a passage through the palace
to choke your sight and raise your malice
the deaneryhouse may well be matchd
under correction with the thatchd
nor shall i when you hither come
demand a crown aquart for stum
then for a middleaged charmer
stella may vie with your mounthermer
shes now as handsome every bit
and has a thousand times her wit
the dean and sheridan i hope
will half supply a gay and pope
corbet though yet i know his worth not
no doubt will prove a good arbuthnot
i throw into the bargain tim
in london can you equal him
what think you of my favourite clan
robin and jack and jack and dan
fellows of modest worth and parts
with cheerful looks and honest hearts


can you on dublin look with scorn
yet here were you and ormond born
o were but you and i so wise
to see with robert grattans eyes
robin adores that spot of earth
that literal spot which gave him birth
and swears belcamp is to his taste
as fine as hamptoncourt at least
when to your friends you would enhance
the praise of italy or france
for grandeur elegance and wit
we gladly hear you and submit
but then to come and keep a clutter
for this or that side of a gutter
to live in this or tother isle
we cannot think it worth your while
for take it kindly or amiss
the difference but amounts to this
we bury on our side the channel
in linen and on yours in flannel
you for the news are neer to seek
while we perhaps may wait a week
you happy folks are sure to meet
a hundred whores in every street
while we may trace all dublin oer
before we find out half a score
you see my arguments are strong
i wonder you held out so long
but since you are convinced at last
well pardon you for what has past
solet us now for whist prepare
twelve pence a corner if you dare


those dreams that on the silent night intrude
and with false flitting shades our minds delude
jove never sends us downward from the skies
nor can they from infernal mansions rise
but are all mere productions of the brain
and fools consult interpreters in vain


for when in bed we rest our weary limbs
the mind unburdend sports in various whims
the busy head with mimic art runs oer
the scenes and actions of the day before


the drowsy tyrant by his minions led
to regal rage devotes some patriots head
with equal terrors not with equal guilt
the murderer dreams of all the blood he spilt


the soldier smiling hears the widows cries
and stabs the son before the mothers eyes
with like remorse his brother of the trade
the butcher fells the lamb beneath his blade


the statesman rakes the town to find a plot
and dreams of forfeitures by treason got
nor less tomtdman of true statesman mould
collects the city filth in search of gold


orphans around his bed the lawyer sees
and takes the plaintiffs and defendants fees
his fellow pickpurse watching for a job
fancies his fingers in the cullys fob


the kind physician grants the husbands prayers
or gives relief to longexpecting heirs
the sleeping hangman ties the fatal noose
nor unsuccessful waits for dead mens shoes


the grave divine with knotty points perplext
as if he were awake nods oer his text
while the sly mountebank attends his trade
harangues the rabble and is better paid


the hireling senator of modern days
bedaubs the guilty great with nauseous praise
and dick the scavenger with equal grace
flirts from his cart the mud in walpoles face


dear sir i think tis doubly hard
your ears and doors should both be barrd
can anything be more unkind
must i not see cause you are blind
methinks a friend at night should cheer you
a friend that loves to see and hear you
why am i robbd of that delight
when you can be no loser byt
nay when tis plain for what is plainer
that if you heard youd be no gainer
for sure you are not yet to learn
that hearing is not your concern
then be your doors no longer barrd
your business sir is to be heard


the wise pretend to make it clear
tis no great loss to lose an ear
why are we then so fond of two
when by experience one would do
tis true say they cut off the head
and theres an end the man is dead
because among all human race
none eer was known to have a brace
but confidently they maintain
that where we find the members twain
the loss of one is no such trouble
since tother will in strength be double
the limb surviving you may swear
becomes his brothers lawful heir
thus for a trial let me beg of
your reverence but to cut one leg off
and you shall find by this device
the other will be stronger twice
for every day you shall be gaining
new vigour to the leg remaining
so when an eye has lost its brother
you see the better with the other
cut off your hand and you may do
with tother hand the work of two
because the soul her power contracts
and on the brother limb reacts
but yet the point is not so clear in
another case the sense of hearing
for though the place of either ear
be distant as one head can bear
yet galen most acutely shows you
consult his book _de partium usu_
that from each ear as he observes
there creep two auditory nerves
not to be seen without a glass
which near the _os petrosum_ pass
thence to the neck and moving thorough there
one goes to this and one to tother ear
which made my grandam always stuff her ears
both right and left as fellowsufferers
you see my learning but to shorten it
when my left ear was deaf a fortnight
to tother ear i felt it coming on
and thus i solve this hard phenomenon


tis true a glass will bring supplies
to weak or old or clouded eyes
your arms though both your eyes were lost
would guard your nose against a post
without your legs two legs of wood
are stronger and almost as good
and as for hands there have been those
who wanting both have used their toes
but no contrivance yet appears
to furnish artificial ears


nell scolded in so loud a din
that will durst hardly venture in
he markd the conjugal dispute
nell roard incessant dick sat mute
but when he saw his friend appear
cried bravely patience good my dear
at sight of will she bawld no more
but hurried out and clapt the door
why dick the devils in thy nell
quoth will thy house is worse than hell
why what a peal the jade has rung
dn her why dont you slit her tongue
for nothing else will make it cease
dear will i suffer this for peace
i never quarrel with my wife
i bear it for a quiet life
scripture you know exhorts us to it
bids us to seek peace and ensue it
will went again to visit dick
and entering in the very nick


he saw virago nell belabour
with dicks own staff his peaceful neighbour
poor will who needs must interpose
received a brace or two of blows
but now to make my story short
will drew out dick to take a quart
why dick thy wife has devilish whims
odsbuds why dont you break her limbs
if she were mine and had such tricks
id teach her how to handle sticks
zds i would ship her to jamaica
or truck the carrion for tobacco
id send her far enough away
dear will but what would people say
lord i should get so ill a name
the neighbours round would cry out shame
dick sufferd for his peace and credit
but who believed him when he said it
can he who makes himself a slave
consult his peace or credit save
dick found it by his ill success
his quiet small his credit less
she served him at the usual rate
she stunnd and then she broke his pate
and what he thought the hardest case
the parish jeerd him to his face
those men who wore the breeches least
calld him a cuckold fool and beast
at home he was pursued with noise
abroad was pesterd by the boys
within his wife would break his bones
without they pelted him with stones
the prentices procured a riding
to act his patience and her chiding
false patience and mistaken pride
there are ten thousand dicks beside
slaves to their quiet and good name
are used like dick and bear the blame


ye poets ragged and forlorn
down from your garrets haste
ye rhymers dead as soon as born
not yet consignd to paste


i know a trick to make you thrive
o tis a quaint device
your stillborn poems shall revive
and scorn to wrap up spice


get all your verses printed fair
then let them well be dried
and curll must have a special care
to leave the margin wide


lend these to papersparing pope
and when he sets to write
no letter with an envelope
could give him more delight


when pope has filld the margins round
why then recall your loan
sell them to curll for fifty pound
and swear they are your own


in spight of pope in spight of gay
and all that he or they can say
sing on i must and sing i will
of richmond lodge and marble hill
last friday night as neighbours use
this couple met to talk of news
for by old proverbs it appears
that walls have tongues and hedges ears


quoth marble hill right well i ween
your mistress now is grown a queen
youll find it soon by woful proof
shell come no more beneath your roof


the kingly prophet well evinces
that we should put no trust in princes
my royal master promised me
to raise me to a high degree
but now hes grown a king god wot
i fear i shall be soon forgot
you see when folks have got their ends
how quickly they neglect their friends
yet i may say twixt me and you
pray god they now may find as true


my house was built but for a show
my ladys empty pockets know
and now she will not have a shilling
to raise the stairs or build the ceiling
for all the courtly madams round
now pay four shillings in the pound
tis come to what i always thought
my dame is hardly worth a groat
had you and i been courtiers born
we should not thus have lain forlorn
for those we dextrous courtiers call
can rise upon their masters fall
but we unlucky and unwise
must fall because our masters rise


my master scarce a fortnight since
was grown as wealthy as a prince
but now it will be no such thing
for hell be poor as any king
and by his crown will nothing get
but like a king to run in debt


no more the dean that grave divine
shall keep the key of my no wine
my icehouse rob as heretofore
and steal my artichokes no more
poor patty blount no more be seen
bedraggled in my walks so green
plump johnny gay will now elope
and here no more will dangle pope


here wont the dean when hes to seek
to spunge a breakfast once aweek
to cry the bread was stale and mutter
complaints against the royal butter
but now i fear it will be said
no butter sticks upon his bread
we soon shall find him full of spleen
for want of tattling to the queen
stunning her royal ears with talking
his reverence and her highness walking
while lady charlotte like a stroller
sits mounted on the gardenroller
a goodly sight to see her ride
with ancient mirmont at her side
in velvet cap his head lies warm
his hat for show beneath his arm


some southsea broker from the city
will purchase me the mores the pity
lay all my fine plantations waste
to fit them to his vulgar taste
changd for the worse in evry part
my master pope will break his heart


in my own thames may i be drownded
if eer i stoop beneath a crownd head
except her majesty prevails
to place me with the prince of wales
and then i shall be free from fears
for hell be prince these fifty years
i then will turn a courtier too
and serve the times as others do
plain loyalty not built on hope
i leave to your contriver pope
none loves his king and country better
yet none was ever less their debtor


then let him come and take a nap
in summer on my verdant lap
prefer our villas where the thames is
to kensington or hot st jamess
nor shall i dull in silence sit
for tis to me he owes his wit
my groves my echoes and my birds
have taught him his poetic words
we gardens and you wildernesses
assist all poets in distresses
him twice aweek i here expect
to rattle moody for neglect
an idle rogue who spends his quartridge
in tippling at the dog and partridge
and i can hardly get him down
three times aweek to brush my gown


i pity you dear marble hill
but hope to see you flourish still
all happinessand so adieu
kind richmond lodge the same to you


tis strange what different thoughts inspire
in men possession and desire
think what they wish so great a blessing
so disappointed when possessing
a moralist profoundly sage
i know not in what book or page
or whether oer a pot of ale
related thus the following tale
possession and desire his brother
but still at variance with each other
were seen contending in a race
and kept at first an equal pace
tis said their course continued long
for this was active that was strong
till envy slander sloth and doubt
misled them many a league about


seduced by some deceiving light
they take the wrong way for the right
through slippery byroads dark and deep
they often climb and often creep
desire the swifter of the two
along the plain like lightning flew
till entering on a broad highway
where power and titles scatterd lay
he strove to pick up all he found
and by excursions lost his ground
no sooner got than with disdain
he threw them on the ground again


and hasted forward to pursue
fresh objects fairer to his view
in hope to spring some nobler game
but all he took was just the same
too scornful now to stop his pace
he spurnd them in his rivals face
possession kept the beaten road
and gatherd all his brother strewd
but overcharged and out of wind
though strong in limbs he laggd behind
desire had now the goal in sight
it was a tower of monstrous height


where on the summit fortune stands
a crown and sceptre in her hands
beneath a chasm as deep as hell
where many a bold adventurer fell
desire in rapture gazed awhile
and saw the treacherous goddess smile
but as he climbd to grasp the crown
she knockd him with the sceptre down


he tumbled in the gulf profound
there doomd to whirl an endless round
possessions load was grown so great
he sunk beneath the cumbrous weight
and as he now expiring lay
flocks every ominous bird of prey
the raven vulture owl and kite
at once upon his carcass light
and strip his hide and pick his bones
regardless of his dying groans


ye wise instruct me to endure
an evil which admits no cure
or how this evil can be borne
which breeds at once both hate and scorn
bare innocence is no support
when you are tried in scandals court
stand high in honour wealth or wit
all others who inferior sit
conceive themselves in conscience bound
to join and drag you to the ground
your altitude offends the eyes
of those who want the power to rise
the world a willing standerby
inclines to aid a specious lie
alas they would not do you wrong
but all appearances are strong
yet whence proceeds this weight we lay
on what detracting people say
for let mankind discharge their tongues
in venom till they burst their lungs
their utmost malice cannot make
your head or tooth or finger ache
nor spoil your shape distort your face
or put one feature out of place
nor will you find your fortune sink
by what they speak or what they think
nor can ten hundred thousand lies
make you less virtuous learnd or wise
the most effectual way to balk
their malice isto let them talk


a set of phrases learnd by rote
a passion for a scarlet coat
when at a play to laugh or cry
yet cannot tell the reason why
never to hold her tongue a minute
while all she prates has nothing in it
whole hours can with a coxcomb sit
and take his nonsense all for wit
her learning mounts to read a song
but half the words pronouncing wrong
has every repartee in store
she spoke ten thousand times before
can ready compliments supply
on all occasions cut and dry
such hatred to a parsons gown
the sight would put her in a swoon
for conversation well endued
she calls it witty to be rude
and placing raillery in railing
will tell aloud your greatest failing
nor make a scruple to expose
your bandy leg or crooked nose
can at her morning tea run oer
the scandal of the day before
improving hourly in her skill
to cheat and wrangle at quadrille
in choosing lace a critic nice
knows to a groat the lowest price
can in her female clubs dispute
what linen best the silk will suit
what colours each complexion match
and where with art to place a patch
if chance a mouse creeps in her sight
can finely counterfeit a fright
so sweetly screams if it comes near her
she ravishes all hearts to hear her
can dextrously her husband teaze
by taking fits wheneer she please
by frequent practice learns the trick
at proper seasons to be sick
thinks nothing gives one airs so pretty
at once creating love and pity
if molly happens to be careless
and but neglects to warm her hairlace
she gets a cold as sure as death
and vows she scarce can fetch her breath
admires how modest women can
be so robustious like a man
in party furious to her power
a bitter whig or tory sour
her arguments directly tend
against the side she would defend
will prove herself a tory plain
from principles the whigs maintain
and to defend the whiggish cause
her topics from the tories draws
o yes if any man can find
more virtues in a womans mind
let them be sent to mrs harding
shell pay the charges to a farthing
take notice she has my commission
to add them in the next edition
they may outsell a better thing
so holla boys god save the king


as clever tom clinch while the rabble was bawling
rode stately through holborn to die in his calling
he stopt at the george for a bottle of sack
and promised to pay for it when he came back
his waistcoat and stockings and breeches were white
his cap had a new cherry ribbon to tiet
the maids to the doors and the balconies ran
and said lackaday hes a proper young man
but as from the windows the ladies he spied
like a beau in the box he bowd low on each side
and when his last speech the loud hawkers did cry
he swore from his cart it was all a damnd lie
the hangman for pardon fell down on his knee
tom gave him a kick in the guts for his fee
then said i must speak to the people a little
but ill see you all damnd before i will whittle
my honest friend wild may he long hold his place
he lengthend my life with a whole year of grace
take courage dear comrades and be not afraid
nor slip this occasion to follow your trade
my conscience is clear and my spirits are calm
and thus i go off without prayerbook or psalm
then follow the practice of clever tom clinch
who hung like a hero and never would flinch


pope has the talent well to speak
but not to reach the ear
his loudest voice is low and weak
the dean too deaf to hear


awhile they on each other look
then different studies choose
the dean sits plodding on a book
pope walks and courts the muse


now backs of letters though designd
for those who more will need em
are filld with hints and interlined
himself can hardly read em


each atom by some other struck
all turns and motions tries
till in a lump together stuck
behold a poem rise


yet to the dean his share allot
he claims it by a canon
that without which a thing is not
is _causa sine quâ non_


thus pope in vain you boast your wit
for had our deaf divine
been for your conversation fit
you had not writ a line


of sherlock thus for preaching framed
the sexton reasond well
and justly half the merit claimd
because he rang the bell


by poets we are well assured
that love alas can neer be cured
a complicated heap of ills
despising boluses and pills
ah chloe this i find is true
since first i gave my heart to you
now by your cruelty hard bound
i strain my guts my colon wound
now jealousy my grumbling tripes
assaults with grating grinding gripes
when pity in those eyes i view
my bowels wambling make me spew
when i an amorous kiss designd
i belchd a hurricane of wind
once you a gentle sigh let fall
remember how i suckd it all
what colic pangs from thence i felt
had you but known your heart would melt
like ruffling winds in cavern pent
till nature pointed out a vent
how have you torn my heart to pieces
with maggots humours and caprices
by which i got the hemorrhoids
and loathsome worms my _anus_ voids
wheneer i hear a rival named
i feel my body all inflamed
which breaking out in boils and blains
with yellow filth my linen stains
or parchd with unextinguishd thirst
smallbeer i guzzle till i burst
and then i drag a bloated _corpus_
swelld with a dropsy like a porpus
when if i cannot purge or stale
i must be tappd to fill a pail


our schoolmaster may roar i th fit
of classic beauty _haec et illa_
not all his birch inspires such wit
as thogling beams of domitilla


let nobles toast in bright champaign
nymphs higher born than domitilla
ill drink her health again again
in berkeleys tar or sarsparilla


at goodmans fields ive much admired
the postures strange of monsieur brilla
but what are they to the soft step
the gliding air of domitilla


virgil has eternized in song
the flying footsteps of camilla
sure as a prophet he was wrong
he might have dreamd of domitilla


great theodose condemnd a town
for thinking ill of his placilla
and deuce take london if some knight
o th city wed not domitilla


wheeler sir george in travels wise
gives us a medal of plantilla
but o the empress has not eyes
nor lips nor breast like domitilla


not all the wealth of plunderd italy
piled on the mules of king attila
is worth one glove ill not tell a bit a lie
or garter snatchd from domitilla


five years a nymph at certain hamlet
ycleped harrow of the hill a
bused much my heart and was a damnd let
to versebut now for domitilla


dan pope consigns belindas watch
to the fair sylphid momentilla
and thus i offer up my catch
to the snowwhite hands of domitilla


now the active young attorneys
briskly travel on their journeys
looking big as any giants
on the horses of their clients
like so many little marses
with their tilters at their as
brazenhilted lately burnishd
and with harnessbuckles furnishd
and with whips and spurs so neat
and with jockeycoats complete
and with boots so very greasy
and with saddles eke so easy
and with bridles fine and gay
bridles borrowd for a day
bridles destined far to roam
ah never never to come home
and with hats so very big sir
and with powderd caps and wigs sir
and with ruffles to be shown
cambric ruffles not their own
and with holland shirts so white
shirts becoming to the sight
shirts bewrought with different letters
as belonging to their betters
with their pretty tinseld boxes
gotten from their dainty doxies
and with rings so very trim
lately taken out of lim
and with very little pence
and as very little sense
with some law but little justice
having stolen from my hostess
from the barber and the cutler
like the soldier from the sutler
from the vintner and the tailor
like the felon from the jailor
into this and tother county
living on the public bounty
thorough town and thorough village
all to plunder all to pillage
thorough mountains thorough valleys
thorough stinking lanes and alleys
some tokiss with farmers spouses
and make merry in their houses
some to tumble country wenches
on their rushy beds and benches
and if they begin a fray
draw their swords andrun away
all to murder equity
and to take a double fee
till the people are all quiet
and forget to broil and riot
low in pocket cowd in courage
safely glad to sup their porridge
and vacations overthen
hey for london town again


the life of man to represent
and turn it all to ridicule
wit did a puppetshow invent
where the chief actor is a fool


the gods of old were logs of wood
and worship was to puppets paid
in antic dress the idol stood
and priest and people bowd the head


no wonder then if art began
the simple votaries to frame
to shape in timber foolish man
and consecrate the block to fame


from hence poetic fancy learnd
that trees might rise from human forms
the body to a trunk be turnd
and branches issue from the arms


thus dædalus and ovid too
that mans a blockhead have confest
powel and stretch the hint pursue
life is a farce the world a jest


the same great truth south sea has proved
on that famed theatre the alley
where thousands by directors moved
are now sad monuments of folly


what momus was of old to jove
the same a harlequin is now
the former was buffoon above
the latter is a punch below


this fleeting scene is but a stage
where various images appear
in different parts of youth and age
alike the prince and peasant share


some draw our eyes by being great
false pomp conceals mere wood within
and legislators ranged in state
are oft but wisdom in machine


a stock may chance to wear a crown
and timber as a lord take place
a statue may put on a frown
and cheat us with a thinking face


others are blindly led away
and made to act for ends unknown
by the mere spring of wires they play
and speak in language not their own


too oft alas a scolding wife
usurps a jolly fellows throne
and many drink the cup of life
mixd and embitterd by a joan


in short whatever men pursue
of pleasure folly war or love
this mimic race brings all to view
alike they dress they talk they move


go on great stretch with artful hand
mortals to please and to deride
and when death breaks thy vital band
thou shalt put on a puppets pride


thou shalt in puny wood be shown
thy image shall preserve thy fame
ages to come thy worth shall own
point at thy limbs and tell thy name


tell tom he draws a farce in vain
before he looks in natures glass
puns cannot form a witty scene
nor pedantry for humour pass


to make men act as senseless wood
and chatter in a mystic strain
is a mere force on flesh and blood
and shows some error in the brain


he that would thus refine on thee
and turn thy stage into a school
the jest of punch will ever be
and stand confest the greater fool


sir twas a most unfriendly part
in you who ought to know my heart
are well acquainted with my zeal
for all the female commonweal
how could it come into your mind
to pitch on me of all mankind
against the sex to write a satire
and brand me for a womanhater
on me who think them all so fair
they rival venus to a hair
their virtues never ceased to sing
since first i learnd to tune a string
methinks i hear the ladies cry
will he his character belie
must never our misfortunes end
and have we lost our only friend
ah lovely nymphs remove your fears
no more let fall those precious tears


the hound be hunted by the hare
than i turn rebel to the fair
twas you engaged me first to write
then gave the subject out of spite
the journal of a modern dame
is by my promise what you claim
my word is past i must submit
and yet perhaps you may be bit
i but transcribe for not a line
of all the satire shall be mine
compelld by you to tag in rhymes
the common slanders of the times
of modern times the guilt is yours
and me my innocence secures
unwilling muse begin thy lay
the annals of a female day


by nature turnd to play the rake well
as we shall show you in the sequel
the modern dame is waked by noon
some authors say not quite so soon
because though sore against her will
she sat all night up at quadrille
she stretches gapes unglues her eyes
and asks if it be time to rise
of headache and the spleen complains
and then to cool her heated brains
her nightgown and her slippers brought her
takes a large dram of citron water
then to her glass and betty pray
dont i look frightfully today
but was it not confounded hard
well if i ever touch a card
four matadores and lose codille
depend upont i never will
but run to tom and bid him fix
the ladies here tonight by six
madam the goldsmith waits below
he says his business is to know
if youll redeem the silver cup
he keeps in pawnwhy show him up
your dressingplate hell be content
to take for interest _cent per cent_
and madam theres my lady spade
has sent this letter by her maid
well i remember what she won
and has she sent so soon to dun
here carry down these ten pistoles
my husband left to pay for coals
i thank my stars they all are light
and i may have revenge tonight
now loitering oer her tea and cream
she enters on her usual theme
her last nights ill success repeats
calls lady spade a hundred cheats
she slipt spadillo in her breast
then thought to turn it to a jest
theres mrs cut and she combine
and to each other give the sign
through every game pursues her tale
like hunters oer their evening ale


now to another scene give place
enter the folks with silks and lace
fresh matter for a world of chat
right indian this right mechlin that
observe this patterntheres a stuff
i can have customers enough
dear madam you are grown so hard
this lace is worth twelve pounds ayard
madam if there be truth in man
i never sold so cheap a fan
this business of importance oer
and madam almost dressd by four
the footman in his usual phrase
comes up with madam dinner stays
she answers in her usual style
the cook must keep it back a while
i never can have time to dress
no woman breathing takes up less
im hurried so it makes me sick
i wish the dinner at old nick
at table now she acts her part
has all the dinner cant by heart
i thought we were to dine alone
my dear for sure if i had known
this company would come today
but really tis my spouses way
hes so unkind he never sends
to tell when he invites his friends
i wish ye may but have enough
and while with all this paltry stuff
she sits tormenting every guest
nor gives her tongue one moments rest
in phrases batterd stale and trite
which modern ladies call polite
you see the booby husband sit
in admiration at her wit


but let me now a while survey
our madam oer her evening tea
surrounded with her noisy clans
of prudes coquettes and harridans
when frighted at the clamorous crew
away the god of silence flew
and fair discretion left the place
and modesty with blushing face
now enters overweening pride
and scandal ever gaping wide
hypocrisy with frown severe
scurrility with gibing air
rude laughter seeming like to burst
and malice always judging worst
and vanity with pocket glass
and impudence with front of brass
and studied affectation came
each limb and feature out of frame
while ignorance with brain of lead
flew hovering oer each female head
why should i ask of thee my muse
a hundred tongues as poets use
when to give every dame her due
a hundred thousand were too few
or how should i alas relate
the sum of all their senseless prate
their innuendoes hints and slanders
their meanings lewd and double entendres
now comes the general scandal charge
what some invent the rest enlarge
and madam if it be a lie
you have the tale as cheap as i
i must conceal my authors name
but now tis known to common fame
say foolish females bold and blind
say by what fatal turn of mind
are you on vices most severe
wherein yourselves have greatest share
thus every fool herself deludes
the prude condemns the absent prudes
mopsa who stinks her spouse to death
accuses chloes tainted breath
hircina rank with sweat presumes
to censure phyllis for perfumes
while crooked cynthia sneering says
that florimel wears iron stays
chloe of every coxcomb jealous
admires how girls can talk with fellows
and full of indignation frets
that women should be such coquettes
iris for scandal most notorious
cries lord the world is so censorious
and rufa with her combs of lead
whispers that sapphos hair is red
aura whose tongue you hear a mile hence
talks half a day in praise of silence
and sylvia full of inward guilt
calls amoret an arrant jilt


now voices over voices rise
while each to be the loudest vies
they contradict affirm dispute
no single tongue one moment mute
all mad to speak and none to hearken
they set the very lapdog barking
their chattering makes a louder din
than fishwives oer a cup of gin
not schoolboys at a barring out
raised ever such incessant rout
the jumbling particles of matter
in chaos made not such a clatter
far less the rabble roar and rail
when drunk with sour election ale
nor do they trust their tongues alone
but speak a language of their own
can read a nod a shrug a look
far better than a printed book
convey a libel in a frown
and wink a reputation down
or by the tossing of the fan
describe the lady and the man
but see the female club disbands
each twenty visits on her hands
now all alone poor madam sits
in vapours and hysteric fits
and was not tom this morning sent
id lay my life he never went
past six and not a living soul
i might by this have won a vole
a dreadful interval of spleen
how shall we pass the time between
here betty let me take my drops
and feel my pulse i know it stops
this head of mine lord how it swims
and such a pain in all my limbs
dear madam try to take a nap
but now they hear a footmans rap
go run and light the ladies up
it must be one before we sup
the table cards and counters set
and all the gamester ladies met
her spleen and fits recoverd quite
our madam can sit up all night
whoever comes im not within
quadrilles the word and so begin


how can the muse her aid impart
unskilld in all the terms of art
or in harmonious numbers put
the deal the shuffle and the cut
the superstitious whims relate
that fill a female gamesters pate
what agony of soul she feels
to see a knaves inverted heels
she draws up card by card to find
good fortune peeping from behind
with panting heart and earnest eyes
in hope to see spadillo rise
in vain alas her hope is fed
she draws an ace and sees it red
in ready counters never pays
but pawns her snuffbox rings and keys
ever with some new fancy struck
tries twenty charms to mend her luck
this morning when the parson came
i said i should not win a game
this odious chair how came i stuck int
i think i never had good luck int
im so uneasy in my stays
your fan a moment if you please
stand farther girl or get you gone
i always lose when you look on
lord madam you have lost codille
i never saw you play so ill
nay madam give me leave to say
twas you that threw the game away
when lady tricksey playd a four
you took it with a matadore
i saw you touch your wedding ring
before my lady calld a king
you spoke a word began with h
and i know whom you meant to teach
because you held the king of hearts
fie madam leave these little arts
thats not so bad as one that rubs
her chair to call the king of clubs
and makes her partner understand
a matadore is in her hand
madam you have no cause to flounce
i swear i saw you thrice renounce
and truly madam i know when
instead of five you scored me ten
spadillo here has got a mark
a child may know it in the dark
i guessd the hand it seldom fails
i wish some folks would pare their nails


while thus they rail and scold and storm
it passes but for common form
but conscious that they all speak true
and give each other but their due
it never interrupts the game
or makes them sensible of shame
the time too precious now to waste
the supper gobbled up in haste
again afresh to cards they run
as if they had but just begun
but i shall not again repeat
how oft they squabble snarl and cheat
at last they hear the watchman knock
a frosty mornpast four oclock
the chairmen are not to be found
come let us play the other round
now all in haste they huddle on
their hoods their cloaks and get them gone
but first the winner must invite
the company tomorrow night
unlucky madam left in tears
who now again quadrille forswears
with empty purse and aching head
steals to her sleeping spouse to bed


logicians have but ill defined
as rational the human kind
reason they say belongs to man
but let them prove it if they can
wise aristotle and smiglesius
by ratiocinations specious
have strove to prove with great precision
with definition and division
_homo est ratione praeditum_
but for my soul i cannot credit em
and must in spite of them maintain
that man and all his ways are vain
and that this boasted lord of nature
is both a weak and erring creature
that instinct is a surer guide
than reason boasting mortals pride
and that brute beasts are far before em
_deus est anima brutorum_


whoever knew an honest brute
at law his neighbour prosecute
bring action for assault or battery
or friend beguile with lies and flattery
oer plains they ramble unconfined
no politics disturb their mind
they eat their meals and take their sport
nor know whos in or out at court
they never to the levee go
to treat as dearest friend a foe
they never importune his grace
nor ever cringe to men in place
nor undertake a dirty job
nor draw the quill to write for bob
fraught with invective they neer go
to folks at paternoster row
no judges fiddlers dancingmasters
no pickpockets or poetasters
are known to honest quadrupeds
no single brute his fellow leads
brutes never meet in bloody fray
nor cut each others throats for pay
of beasts it is confessd the ape
comes nearest us in human shape
like man he imitates each fashion
and malice is his lurking passion
but both in malice and grimaces
a courtier any ape surpasses
behold him humbly cringing wait
upon the minister of state
view him soon after to inferiors
aping the conduct of superiors
he promises with equal air
and to perform takes equal care
he in his turn finds imitators
at court the porters lacqueys waiters
their masters manner still contract
and footmen lords and dukes can act
thus at the court both great and small
behave alike for all ape all


ere bribes convince you whom to choose
the precepts of lord coke peruse
observe an elephant says he
and let him like your member be
first take a man thats free from _gaul_
for elephants have none at all
in flocks or parties he must keep
for elephants live just like sheep
stubborn in honour he must be
for elephants neer bend the knee
last let his memory be sound
in which your elephants profound
that old examples from the wise
may prompt him in his noes and ayes
thus the lord coke hath gravely writ
in all the form of lawyers wit
and then with latin and all that
shows the comparison is pat
yet in some points my lord is wrong
ones teeth are sold and tothers tongue
now men of parliament god knows
are more like elephants of shows
whose docile memory and sense
are turnd to trick to gather pence
to get their master halfacrown
they spread the flag or lay it down
those who bore bulwarks on their backs
and guarded nations from attacks
now practise every pliant gesture
opening their trunk for every tester
siam for elephants so famed
is not with england to be named
their elephants by men are sold
ours sell themselves and take the gold


lindsay mistakes the matter quite
and honest paulus judges right
then why these quarrels to the sun
without whose aid youre all undone
did paulus eer complain of sweat
did paulus eer the sun forget
the influence of whose golden beams
soon licks up all unsavoury steams
the sun you say his face has kissd
it has but then it greased his fist
true lawyers for the wisest ends
have always been apollos friends
not for his superficial powers
of ripening fruits and gilding flowers
not for inspiring poets brains
with penniless and starveling strains
not for his boasted healing art
not for his skill to shoot the dart
nor yet because he sweetly fiddles
nor for his prophecies in riddles
but for a more substantial cause
apollos patron of the laws
whom paulus ever must adore
as parent of the golden ore
by phoebus an incestuous birth
begot upon his grandam earth
by phoebus first produced to light
by vulcan formd so round and bright
then offerd at the shrine of justice
by clients to her priests and trustees
nor when we see astraea stand
with even balance in her hand
must we suppose she has in view
how to give every man his due
her scales you see her only hold
to weigh her priests the lawyers gold
now should i own your case was grievous
poor sweaty paulus whod believe us
tis very true and none denies
at least that such complaints are wise


tis wise no doubt as clients fat you more
to cry like statesmen _quanta patimur_
but since the truth must needs be stretched
to prove that lawyers are so wretched
this paradox ill undertake
for paulus and for lindsays sake
by topics which though i abomine em
may serve as arguments _ad hominem_
yet i disdain to offer those
made use of by detracting foes
i own the curses of mankind
sit light upon a lawyers mind
the clamours of ten thousand tongues
break not his rest nor hurt his lungs
i own his conscience always free
provided he has got his fee
secure of constant peace within
he knows no guilt who knows no sin
yet well they merit to be pitied
by clients always overwitted
and though the gospel seems to say
what heavy burdens lawyers lay
upon the shoulders of their neighbour
nor lend a finger to their labour
always for saving their own bacon
no doubt the text is here mistaken
the copys false the sense is rackd
to prove it i appeal to fact
and thus by demonstration show
what burdens lawyers undergo
with early clients at his door
though he was drunk the night before
and cropsick with unclubbdfor wine
the wretch must be at court by nine
half sunk beneath his briefs and bag
as ridden by a midnight hag
then from the bar harangues the bench
in english vile and viler french
and latin vilest of the three
and all for poor ten moidores fee
of paper how is he profuse
with periods long in terms abstruse
what pains he takes to be prolix
a thousand lines to stand for six
of common sense without a word in
and is not this a grievous burden


the lawyer is a common drudge
to fight our cause before the judge
and what is yet a greater curse
condemnd to bear his clients purse
while he at ease secure and light
walks boldly home at dead of night
when term is ended leaves the town
trots to his country mansion down
and disencumberd of his load
no danger dreads upon the road
despises rapparees and rides
safe through the newry mountains sides
lindsay tis you have set me on
to state this question _pro_ and _con_
my satire may offend tis true
however it concerns not you
i own there may in every clan
perhaps be found one honest man
yet link them close in this they jump
to be but rascals in the lump
imagine lindsay at the bar
hes much the same his brethren are
well taught by practice to imbibe
the fundamentals of his tribe
and in his clients just defence
must deviate oft from common sense
and make his ignorance discernd
to get the name of counsellearnd
as _lucus_ comes _a non lucendo_
and wisely do as other men do
but shift him to a better scene
among his crew of rogues in grain
surrounded with companions fit
to taste his humour sense and wit
youd swear he never took a fee
nor knew in law his a b c


tis hard where dulness overrules
to keep good sense in crowds of fools
and we admire the man who saves
his honesty in crowds of knaves
nor yields up virtue at discretion
to villains of his own profession
lindsay you know what pains you take
in both yet hardly save your stake
and will you venture both anew
to sit among that venal crew
that pack of mimic legislators
abandond stupid slavish praters
for as the rabble daub and rifle
the fool who scrambles for a trifle
who for his pains is cuffd and kickd
drawn through the dirt his pockets pickd
you must expect the like disgrace
scrambling with rogues to get a place
must lose the honour you have gaind
your numerous virtues foully staind
disclaim for ever all pretence
to common honesty and sense
and join in friendship with a strict tie
to ml cy and dick tighe


since there are persons who complain
theres too much satire in my vein
that i am often found exceeding
the rules of raillery and breeding
with too much freedom treat my betters
not sparing even men of letters
you who are skilld in lawyers lore
whats your advice shall i give oer
nor ever fools or knaves expose
either in verse or humorous prose
and to avoid all future ill
in my scrutoire lock up my quill


since you are pleased to condescend
to ask the judgment of a friend
your case considerd i must think
you should withdraw from pen and ink
forbear your poetry and jokes
and live like other christian folks
or if the muses must inspire
your fancy with their pleasing fire
take subjects safer for your wit
than those on which you lately writ
commend the times your thoughts correct
and follow the prevailing sect
assert that hyde in writing story
shows all the malice of a tory
while burnet in his deathless page
discovers freedom without rage
to woolston recommend our youth
for learning probity and truth
that noble genius who unbinds
the chains which fetter freeborn minds
redeems us from the slavish fears
which lasted near two thousand years
he can alone the priesthood humble
make gilded spires and altars tumble


must i commend against my conscience
such stupid blasphemy and nonsense
to such a subject tune my lyre
and sing like one of miltons choir
where devils to a vale retreat
and call the laws of wisdom fate
lament upon their hapless fall
that force free virtue should enthrall
or shall the charms of wealth and power
make me pollute the muses bower


as from the tripod of apollo
hear from my desk the words that follow
some by philosophers misled
must honour you alive and dead
and such as know what greece has writ
must taste your irony and wit
while most that are or would be great
must dread your pen your person hate
and you on drapiers hill must lie
and there without a mitre die


rise up rise up
and as the trumpet blowing
chases the dreams of men
as the dawn glowing


the stars that left unlit
the land and water
rise up and scatter
the dew that covers
the print of last nights lovers
scatter it scatter it


while you are listening
to the clear horn
forget men everything
on this earth newborn


the dim sea glints chill the white sun is shy
and the skeleton weeds and the neverdry
rough long grasses keep white with frost
at the hilltop by the fingerpost
the smoke of the travellersjoy is puffed
over hawthorn berry and hazel tuft


i read the sign which way shall i go
a voice says you would not have doubted so
at twenty another voice gentle with scorn
says at twenty you wished you had never been born


one hazel lost a leaf of gold
from a tuft at the tip when the first voice told
the other he wished to know what twould be
to be sixty by this same post you shall see
he laughedand i had to join his laughter
you shall see but either before or after
whatever happens it must befall
a mouthful of earth to remedy all


regrets and wishes shall freely be given
and if there be a flaw in that heaven
twill be freedom to wish and your wish may be
to be here or anywhere talking to me
no matter what the weather on earth
at any age between death and birth
to see what day or night can be
the sun and the frost the land and the sea
summer autumn winter spring
with a poor man of any sort down to a king
standing upright out in the air
wondering where he shall journey o where


under the aftersunset sky
two pewits sport and cry
more white than is the moon on high
riding the dark surge silently
more black than earth their cry
is the one sound under the sky
they alone move now low now high
and merrily they cry
to the mischievous spring sky
plunging earthward tossing high
over the ghost who wonders why
so merrily they cry and fly
nor choose twixt earth and sky
while the moons quarter silently
rides and earth rests as silently


downhill i came hungry and yet not starved
cold yet had heat within me that was proof
against the north wind tired yet so that rest
had seemed the sweetest thing under a roof


then at the inn i had food fire and rest
knowing how hungry cold and tired was i
all of the night was quite barred out except
an owls cry a most melancholy cry


shaken out long and clear upon the hill
no merry note nor cause of merriment
but one telling me plain what i escaped
and others could not that night as in i went


and salted was my food and my repose
salted and sobered too by the birds voice
speaking for all who lay under the stars
soldiers and poor unable to rejoice


will you come
will you come
will you ride
so late
at my side
o will you come


will you come
will you come
if the night
has a moon
full and bright
o will you come


would you come
would you come
if the noon
gave light
not the moon
beautiful would you come


would you have come
would you have come
without scorning
had it been
still morning
beloved would you have come


if you come
haste and come
owls have cried
it grows dark
to ride
beloved beautiful come


over the land freckled with snow halfthawed
the speculating rooks at their nests cawed
and saw from elmtops delicate as flower of grass
what we below could not see winter pass


gone the wild day
a wilder night
coming makes way
for brief twilight


where the firm soaked road
mounts and is lost
in the high beechwood
it shines almost


the beeches keep
a stormy rest
breathing deep
of wind from the west


the wood is black
with a misty steam
above the cloud pack
breaks for one gleam


but the woodmans cot
by the ivied trees
awakens not
to light or breeze


it smokes aloft
unwavering
it hunches soft
under storms wing


it has no care
for gleam or gloom
it stays there
while i shall roam


die and forget
the hill of trees
the gleam the wet
this roaring peace


like the touch of rain she was
on a mans flesh and hair and eyes
when the joy of walking thus
has taken him by surprise


with the love of the storm he burns
he sings he laughs well i know how
but forgets when he returns
as i shall not forget her go now


those two words shut a door
between me and the blessed rain
that was never shut before
and will not open again


if i should ever by chance grow rich
ill buy codham cockridden and childerditch
roses pyrgo and lapwater
and let them all to my elder daughter
the rent i shall ask of her will be only
each years first violets white and lonely
the first primroses and orchises
she must find them before i do that is
but if she finds a blossom on furze
without rent they shall all for ever be hers


if i were to own this countryside
as far as a man in a day could ride
and the tyes were mine for giving or letting
wingle tye and margaretting
tyeand skreens gooshays and cockerells
shellow rochetts bandish and pickerells
marlins lambkins and lillyputs
their copses ponds roads and ruts
fields where ploughhorses steam and plovers
fling and whimper hedges that lovers
love and orchards shrubberies walls
where the sun untroubled by north wind falls


and single trees where the thrush sings well
his proverbs untranslatable
i would give them all to my son
if he would let me any one
for a song a blackbirds song at dawn
he should have no more till on my lawn
never a one was left because i
had shot them to put them into a pie
his essex blackbirds every one
and i was left old and alone


then unless i could pay for rent a song
as sweet as a blackbirds and as long
no morehe should have the house not i
margaretting or wingle tye
or it might be skreens gooshays or cockerells
shellow rochetts bandish or pickerells
martins lambkins or lillyputs
should be his till the cart tracks had no ruts


and you helen what should i give you
so many things i would give you
had i an infinite great store
offered me and i stood before
to choose i would give you youth
all kinds of loveliness and truth
a clear eye as good as mine
lands waters flowers wine
as many children as your heart
might wish for a far better art
than mine can be all you have lost
upon the travelling waters tossed


or given to me if i could choose
freely in that great treasurehouse
anything from any shelf
i would give you back yourself
and power to discriminate
what you want and want it not too late
many fair days free from care
and heart to enjoy both foul and fair
and myself too if i could find
where it lay hidden and it proved kind


when first i came here i had hope
hope for i knew not what fast beat
my heart at sight of the tall slope
or grass and yews as if my feet


only by scaling its steps of chalk
would see something no other hill
ever disclosed and now i walk
down it the last time never will


my heart beat so again at sight
of any hill although as fair
and loftier for infinite
the change late unperceived this year


the twelfth suddenly shows me plain
hope nownot health nor cheerfulness
since they can come and go again
as often one brief hour witnesses


just hope has gone for ever perhaps
i may love other hills yet more
than this the future and the maps
hide something i was waiting for


one thing i know that love with chance
and use and time and necessity
will grow and louder the hearts dance
at parting than at meeting be


the downs will lose the sun white alyssum
lose the bees hum
but head and bottle tilted back in the cart
will never part
till i am cold as midnight and all my hours
are beeless flowers
he neither sees nor hears nor smells nor thinks
but only drinks
quiet in the yard where tree trunks do not lie
more quietly


it was a perfect day
for sowing just
as sweet and dry was the ground
as tobaccodust


i tasted deep the hour
between the far
owls chuckling first soft cry
and the first star


a long stretched hour it was
nothing undone
remained the early seeds
all safely sown


and now hark at the rain
windless and light
half a kiss half a tear
saying goodnight


when we two walked in lent
we imagined that happiness
was something different
and this was something less


but happy were we to hide
our happiness not as they were
who acted in their pride
juno and jupiter


for the gods in their jealousy
murdered that wife and man
and we that were wise live free
to recall our happiness then


the flowers left thick at nightfall in the wood
this eastertide call into mind the men
now far from home who with their sweethearts should
have gathered them and will do never again


women he liked did shovelbearded bob
old farmer hayward of the heath but he
loved horses he himself was like a cob
and leathercoloured also he loved a tree


for the life in them he loved most living things
but a tree chiefly all along the lane
he planted elms where now the stormcock sings
that travellers hear from the slowclimbing train


till then the track had never had a name
for all its thicket and the nightingales
that should have earned it no one was to blame
to name a thing beloved man sometimes fails


many years since bob hayward died and now
none passes there because the mist and the rain
out of the elms have turned the lane to slough
and gloom the name alone survives bobs lane


early one morning in may i set out
and nobody i knew was about
im bound away for ever
away somewhere away for ever


there was no wind to trouble the weathercocks
i had burnt my letters and darned my socks


no one knew i was going away
i thought myself i should come back some day


i heard the brook through the town gardens run
o sweet was the mud turned to dust by the sun


a gate banged in a fence and banged in my head
a fine morning sir a shepherd said


i could not return from my liberty
to my youth and my love and my misery


the past is the only dead thing that smells sweet
the only sweet thing that is not also fleet
im bound away for ever
away somewhere away for ever


the cherry trees bend over and are shedding
on the old road where all that passed are dead
their petals strewing the grass as for a wedding
this early may morn when there is none to wed


it rains and nothing stirs within the fence
anywhere through the orchards untrodden dense
forest of parsley the great diamonds
of rain on the grassblades there is none to break
or the fallen petals further down to shake


and i am nearly as happy as possible
to search the wilderness in vain though well
to think of two walking kissing there
drenched yet forgetting the kisses of the rain
sad too to think that never never again


unless alone so happy shall i walk
in the rain when i turn away on its fine stalk
twilight has fined to naught the parsley flower
figures suspended still and ghostly white
the past hovering as it revisits the light


he has a hump like an ape on his back
he has of money a plentiful lack
and but for a gay coat of double his girth
there is not a plainer thing on the earth
this fine may morning


but the huxter has a bottle of beer
he drives a cart and his wife sits near
who does not heed his lack or his hump
and they laugh as down the lane they bump
this fine may morning


he has robbed two clubs the judge at salisbury
cant give him more than he undoubtedly
deserves the scoundrel look at his photograph
a ladykiller hangings too good by half
for such as he so said the stranger one
with crimes yet undiscovered or undone
but at the inn the gipsy dame began
now he was what i call a gentleman
he went along with carrie and when she
had a baby he paid up so readily


his half a crown just like him a crownd have been
more like him for i never knew him mean
oh but he was such a nice gentleman oh
last time we met he said if me and joe
was anywhere near we must be sure and call
he put his arms around our amos all
as if he were his own son i pray god
save him from justice nicer man never trod


at hawthorntime in wiltshire travelling
in search of something chance would never bring
an old mans face by life and weather cut
and colouredrough brown sweet as any nut
a land face seablueeyedhung in my mind
when i had left him many a mile behind
all he said was nobody cant stop ee its
a footpath right enough you see those bits
of moundsthats where they opened up the barrows
sixty years since while i was scaring sparrows


they thought as there was something to find there
but couldnt find it by digging anywhere


to turn back then and seek him where was the use
there were three manning fords abbots bohun and bruce
and whether alton not manning ford it was
my memory could not decide because
there was both alton barnes and alton priors
all had their churches graveyards farms and byres
lurking to one side up the paths and lanes
seldom well seen except by aeroplanes


and when bells rang or pigs squealed or cocks crowed
then only heard ages ago the road
approached the people stood and looked and turned
nor asked it to come nearer nor yet learned
to move out there and dwell in all mens dust
and yet withal they shot the weathercock just


because twas he crowed out of tune they said
so now the copper weathercock is dead
if they had reaped their dandelions and sold
them fairly they could have afforded gold


many years passed and i went back again
among those villages and looked for men
who might have known my ancient he himself
had long been dead or laid upon the shelf
i thought one man i asked about him roared
at my description tis old bottlesford
he means bill but another said of course
it was jack button up at the white horse
hes dead sir these three years this lasted till
a girl proposed walker of walkers hill
old adam walker adams point youll see
marked on the maps that was her roguery
the next man said he was a squires son
who loved wild bird and beast and dog and gun
for killing them he had loved them from his birth
one with another as he loved the earth


the man may be like button or walker or
like bottlesford that you want but far more
he sounds like one i saw when i was a child
i could almost swear to him the man was wild
and wandered his home was where he was free
everybody has met one such man as he
does he keep clear old paths that no one uses
but once a lifetime when he loves or muses
he is english as this gate these flowers this mire
and when at eight years old lob lie by the fire


came in my books this was the man i saw
he has been in england as long as dove and daw
calling the wild cherry tree the merry tree
the rose campion bridgetinherbravery
and in a tender mood he as i guess
christened one flower love in idleness
and while he walked from exeter to leeds
one april called all cuckoo flowers milkmaids
from him old herbal gerard learnt as a boy
to name wild clematis the travellers joy


our blackbirds sang no english till his ear
told him they called his jan toy pretty dear
she was jan toy the lucky who having lost
a shilling and found a penny loaf rejoiced
for reasons of his own to him the wren
is jenny pooter before all other men
twas he first called the hogs back the hogs back
that mother dunchs buttocks should not lack
their name was his care he too could explain
totteridge and totterdown and jugglers lane
he knows if anyone why tumbling bay
inland in kent is called so he might say


but little he says compared with what he does
if ever a sage troubles him he will buzz
like a beehive to conclude the tedious fray
and the sage who knows all languages runs away
yet lob has thirteen hundred names for a fool
and though he never could spare time for school
to unteach what the fox so well expressed
on biting the cocks head offquietness is best


he can talk quite as well as anyone
after his thinking is forgot and done
he first of all told someone elses wife
for a farthing shed skin a flint and spoil a knife
worth sixpence skinning it she heard him speak
she had a face as long as a wet week
said he telling the tale in after years
with blue smock and with gold rings in his ears
sometimes he is a pedlar not too poor
to keep his wit this is tall tom that bore
the logs in and with shakespeare in the hall
once talked when icicles hung by the wall
as herne the hunter he has known hard times
on sleepless nights he made up weather rhymes


which others spoilt and hob being then his name
he kept the hog that thought the butcher came
to bring his breakfast you thought wrong said hob
when there were kings in kent this very lob
whose sheep grew fat and he himself grew merry
wedded the kings daughter of canterbury
for he alone unlike squire lord and king
watched a night by her without slumbering
he kept both waking when he was but a lad
he won a rich mans heiress deaf dumb and sad


by rousing her to laugh at him he carried
his donkey on his back so they were married
and while he was a little cobblers boy
he tricked the giant coming to destroy
shrewsbury by flood and how far is it yet
the giant asked in passing i forget
but see these shoes ive worn out on the road
and were not there yet he emptied out his load
of shoes for mending the giant let fall from his spade
the earth for damming severn and thus made


the wrekin hill and little ercall hill
rose where the giant scraped his boots while still
so young our jack was chief of gothams sages
but long before he could have been wise ages
earlier than this while he grew thick and strong
and ate his bacon or at times sang a song
and merely smelt it as jack the giantkiller
he made a name he too ground up the miller
the yorkshireman who ground mens bones for flour
do you believe jack dead before his hour
or that his name is walker or bottlesford
or button a mere clown or squire or lord
the man you sawlobliebythefire jack cade
jack smith jack moon poor jack of every trade
young jack or old jack or jack what dye call
jack in the hedge or robin run by the wall


robin hood ragged robin lazy bob
one of the lords of no mans land good lob
although he was seen dying at waterloo
hastings agincourt and sedgemoor too
lives yet he never will admit he is dead
till millers cease to grind mens bones for bread
not till our weathercock crows once again
and i remove my house out of the lane
on to the road with this he disappeared
in hazel and thorn tangled with old mans beard
but one glimpse of his back as there he stood
choosing his way proved him of old jacks blood
young jack perhaps and now a wiltshireman
as he has oft been since his days began


the clouds that are so light
beautiful swift and bright
cast shadows on field and park
of the earth that is so dark


and even so now light one
beautiful swift and bright one
you let fall on a heart that was dark
unillumined a deeper mark


but clouds would have without earth
to shadow far less worth
away from your shadow on me
your beauty less would be


and if it still be treasured
an age hence it shall be measured
by this small dark spot
without which it were not


there never was a finer day
and never will be while may is may
the third and not the last of its kind
but though fair and clear the two behind
seemed pursued by tempests overpast
and the morrow with fear that it could not last
was spoiled today ere the stones were warm
five minutes of thunderstorm
dashed it with rain as if to secure
by one tear its beauty the luck to endure


at midday then along the lane
old jack noman appeared again
jaunty and old crooked and tall
and stopped and grinned at me over the wall
with a cowslip bunch in his buttonhole
and one in his cap who could say if his roll
came from flints in the road the weather or ale
he was welcome as the nightingale


not an hour of the sun had been wasted on jack
ive got my indian complexion back
said he he was tanned like a harvester
like his short clay pipe like the leaf and bur
that clung to his coat from last nights bed
like the ploughland crumbling red
fairer flowers were none on the earth
than his cowslips wet with the dew of their birth
or fresher leaves than the cress in his basket
where did they come from jack dont ask it


and youll be told no lies very well
then i cant buy i dont want to sell
take them and these flowers too free
perhaps you have something to give me
wait till next time the better the day
the lord couldnt make a better i say
if he could he never has done
so off went jack with his roll walk run
leaving his cresses from oakshott rill
and his cowslips from wheatham hill


twas the first day that the midges bit
but though they bit me i was glad of it
of the dust in my face too i was glad
spring could do nothing to make me sad
bluebells hid all the ruts in the copse
the elm seeds lay in the road like hops
that fine day may the twentythird
the day jack noman disappeared


the rain and wind the rain and wind raved endlessly
on me the summer storm and fever and melancholy
wrought magic so that if i feared the solitude
far more i feared all company too sharp too rude
had been the wisest or the dearest human voice
what i desired i knew not but whateer my choice
vain it must be i knew yet naught did my despair
but sweeten the strange sweetness while through the wild air
all day long i heard a distant cuckoo calling
and soft as dulcimers sounds of near water falling
and softer and remote as if in history
rumours of what had touched my friends my foes or me


yes i remember adlestrop
the name because one afternoon
of heat the expresstrain drew up there
unwontedly it was late june


the steam hissed someone cleared his throat
no one left and no one came
on the bare platform what i saw
was adlestroponly the name


and willows willowherb and grass
and meadowsweet and haycocks dry
no whit less still and lonely fair
than the high cloudlets in the sky


and for that minute a blackbird sang
close by and round him mistier
farther and farther all the birds
of oxfordshire and gloucestershire


the sun blazed while the thunder yet
added a boom
a wagtail flickered bright over
the millponds gloom


less than the cooing in the alder
isles of the pool
sounded the thunder through that plunge
of waters cool


scared starlings on the aspen tip
past the black mill
outchattered the stream and the next roar
far on the hill


as my feet dangling teased the foam
that slid below
a girl came out take care she said
ages ago


she startled me standing quite close
dressed all in white
ages ago i was angry till
she passed from sight


then the storm burst and as i crouched
to shelter how
beautiful and kind too she seemed
as she does now


it was upon a july evening
at a stile i stood looking along a path
over the country by a second spring
drenched perfect green again the lattermath
will be a fine one so the stranger said
a wandering man albeit i stood at rest
flushed with desire i was the earth outspread
like meadows of the future i possessed


and as an unaccomplished prophecy
the strangers words after the interval
of a score years when those fields are by me
never to be recrossed now i recall
this july eve and question wondering
what of the lattermath to this hoar spring


tall nettles cover up as they have done
these many springs the rusty harrow the plough
long worn out and the roller made of stone
only the elm butt tops the nettles now


this corner of the farmyard i like most
as well as any bloom upon a flower
i like the dust on the nettles never lost
except to prove the sweetness of a shower


after nights thunder far away had rolled
the fiery day had a kernel sweet of cold
and in the perfect blue the clouds uncurled
like the first gods before they made the world
and misery swimming the stormless sea
in beauty and in divine gaiety
the smooth white empty road was lightly strewn
with leavesthe hollys autumn falls in june
and fir cones standing stiff up in the heat
the millfoot water tumbled white and lit


with tossing crystals happier than any crowd
of children pouring out of school aloud
and in the little thickets where a sleeper
for ever might lie lost the nettlecreeper
and garden warbler sang unceasingly
while over them shrill shrieked in his fierce glee
the swift with wings and tail as sharp and narrow
as if the bow had flown off with the arrow
only the scent of woodbine and hay newmown
travelled the road in the field sloping down


parklike to where its willows showed the brook
haymakers rested the tosser lay forsook
out in the sun and the long waggon stood
without its team it seemed it never would
move from the shadow of that single yew
the team as still until their task was due
beside the labourers enjoyed the shade
that three squat oaks midfield together made
upon a circle of grass and weed uncut
and on the hollow once a chalkpit but


now brimmed with nut and elderflower so clean
the men leaned on their rakes about to begin
but still and all were silent all was old
this morning time with a great age untold
older than clare and cobbett morland and crome
than at the fields far edge the farmers home
a white house crouched at the foot of a great tree
under the heavens that know not what years be
the men the beasts the trees the implements
uttered even what they will in times far hence
all of us gone out of the reach of change
immortal in a picture of an old grange


how at once should i know
when stretched in the harvest blue
i saw the swifts black bow
that i would not have that view
another day
until next may
again it is due


the same year after year
but with the swift alone
with other things i but fear
that they will be over and done
suddenly
and i only see
them to know them gone


the sun used to shine while we two walked
slowly together paused and started
again and sometimes mused sometimes talked
as either pleased and cheerfully parted


each night we never disagreed
which gate to rest on the to be
and the late past we gave small heed
we turned from men or poetry


to rumours of the war remote
only till both stood disinclined
for aught but the yellow flavorous coat
of an apple wasps had undermined


or a sentry of dark betonies
the stateliest of small flowers on earth
at the forest verge or crocuses
pale purple as if they had their birth


in sunless hades fields the war
came back to mind with the moonrise
which soldiers in the east afar
beheld then nevertheless our eyes


could as well imagine the crusades
or caesars battles everything
to faintness like those rumours fades
like the brooks water glittering


under the moonlightlike those walks
nowlike us two that took them and
the fallen apples all the talks
and silenceslike memorys sand


when the tide covers it late or soon
and other men through other flowers
in those fields under the same moon
go talking and have easy hours


the long small room that showed willows in the west
narrowed up to the end the fireplace filled
although not wide i liked it no one guessed
what need or accident made them so build


only the moon the mouse and the sparrow peeped
in from the ivy round the casement thick
of all they saw and heard there they shall keep
the tale for the old ivy and older brick


when i look back i am like moon sparrow and mouse
that witnessed what they could never understand
or alter or prevent in the dark house
one thing remains the samethis my right hand


crawling crablike over the clean white page
resting awhile each morning on the pillow
then once more starting to crawl on towards age
the hundred last leaves stream upon the willow


novembers days are thirty
novembers earth is dirty
those thirty days from first to last
and the prettiest things on ground are the paths
with morning and evening hobnails dinted
with foot and wingtip overprinted
or separately charactered
of little beast and little bird


the fields are mashed by sheep the roads
make the worst going the best the woods
where dead leaves upward and downward scatter
few care for the mixture of earth and water
twig leaf flint thorn
straw feather all that men scorn
pounded up and sodden by flood
condemned as mud


but of all the months when earth is greener
not one has clean skies that are cleaner
clean and clear and sweet and cold
they shine above the earth so old


while the aftertempest cloud
sails over in silence though winds are loud
till the full moon in the east
looks at the planet in the west
and earth is silent as it is black
yet not unhappy for its lack
up from the dirty earth men stare
one imagines a refuge there


above the mud in the pure bright
of the cloudless heavenly light
another loves earth and november more dearly
because without them he sees clearly
the sky would be nothing more to his eye
than he in any case is to the sky
he loves even the mud whose dyes
renounce all brightness to the skies


there was a weasel lived in the sun
with all his family
till a keeper shot him with his gun
and hung him up on a tree
where he swings in the wind and rain
in the sun and in the snow
without pleasure without pain
on the dead oak tree bough


there was a crow who was no sleeper
but a thief and a murderer
till a very late hour and this keeper
made him one of the things that were
to hang and flap in rain and wind
in the sun and in the snow
there are no more sins to be sinned
on the dead oak tree bough


there was a magpie too
had a long tongue and a long tail
he could both talk and do
but what did that avail
he too flaps in the wind and rain
alongside weasel and crow
without pleasure without pain
on the dead oak tree bough


and many other beasts
and birds skin bone and feather
have been taken from their feasts
and hung up there together
to swing and have endless leisure
in the sun and in the snow
without pain without pleasure
on the dead oak tree bough


the summer nests uncovered by autumn wind
some torn others dislodged all dark
everyone sees them low or high in tree
or hedge or single bush they hang like a mark


since theres no need of eyes to see them with
i cannot help a little shame
that i missed most even at eyes level till
the leaves blew off and made the seeing no game


tis a light pang i like to see the nests
still in their places now first known
at home and by far roads boys knew them not
whatever jays and squirrels may have done


and most i like the winter nests deephid
that leaves and berries fell into
once a dormouse dined there on hazelnuts
and grass and goosegrass seeds found soil and grew


the sun set the wind fell the sea
was like a mirror shaking
the one small wave that clapped the land
a milelong snake of foam was making
where tide had smoothed and wind had dried
the vacant sand


a light divided the swollen clouds
and lay most perfectly
like a straight narrow footbridge bright
that crossed over the sea to me
and no one else in the whole world
saw that same sight


i walked elate my bridge always
just one step from my feet
a robin sang a shade in shade
and all i did was to repeat
ill go no more aroving
with you fair maid


the new moon hangs like an ivory bugle
in the naked frosty blue
and the ghylls of the forest already blackened
by winter are blackened anew


the brooks that cut up and increase the forest
as if they had never known
the sun are roaring with black hollow voices
betwixt rage and a moan


but still the caravanhut by the hollies
like a kingfisher gleams between
round the mossed old hearths of the charcoalburners
first primroses ask to be seen


the charcoalburners are black but their linen
blows white on the line
and white the letter the girl is reading
under that crescent fine


and her brother who hides apart in a thicket
slowly and surely playing
on a whistle an olden nursery melody
says far more than i am saying


i have come to the borders of sleep
the unfathomable deep
forest where all must lose
their way however straight
or winding soon or late
they cannot choose


many a road and track
that since the dawns first crack
up to the forest brink
deceived the travellers
suddenly now blurs
and in they sink


here love ends
despair ambition ends
all pleasure and all trouble
although most sweet or bitter
here ends in sleep that is sweeter
than tasks most noble


there is not any book
or face of dearest look
that i would not turn from now
to go into the unknown
i must enter and leave alone
i know not how


the tall forest towers
its cloudy foliage lowers
ahead shelf above shelf
its silence i hear and obey
that i may lose my way
and myself


out of the wood of thoughts that grows by night
to be cut down by the sharp axe of light
out of the night two cocks together crow
cleaving the darkness with a silver blow
and bright before my eyes twin trumpeters stand
heralds of splendour one at either hand
each facing each as in a coat of arms
the milkers lace their boots up at the farms


the partial muse has from my earliest hours
smild on the rugged path im doomd to tread
and still with sportive hand has snatchd wild flowers
to weave fantastic garlands for my head
but far far happier is the lot of those
who never learnd her dear delusive art
which while it decks the head with many a rose
reserves the thorn to fester in the heart
for still she bids soft pitys melting eye
stream oer the ills she knows not to remove
points every pang and deepens every sigh
of mourning friendship or unhappy love
ah then how dear the muses favours cost
if those paint sorrow bestwho feel it most


the garlands fade that spring so lately wove
each simple flower which she had nursed in dew
anemonies that spangled every grove
the primrose wan and harebell mildly blue
no more shall violets linger in the dell
or purple orchis variegate the plain
till spring again shall call forth every bell
and dress with humid hands her wreaths again
ah poor humanity so frail so fair
are the fond visions of thy early day
till tyrant passion and corrosive care
bid all thy fairy colours fade away
another may new buds and flowers shall bring
ah why has happinessno second spring


poor melancholy birdthat all night long
tellst to the moon thy tale of tender woe
from what sad cause can such sweet sorrow flow
and whence this mournful melody of song
thy poets musing fancy would translate
what mean the sounds that swell thy little breast
when still at dewy eve thou leavst thy nest
thus to the listening night to sing thy fate
pale sorrows victims wert thou once among
though now released in woodlands wild to rove
sayhast thou felt from friends some cruel wrong
or diedst thoumartyr of disastrous love
ah songstress sad that such my lot might be
to sigh and sing at libertylike thee


queen of the silver bowby thy pale beam
alone and pensive i delight to stray
and watch thy shadow trembling in the stream
or mark the floating clouds that cross thy way
and while i gaze thy mild and placid light
sheds a soft calm upon my troubled breast
and oft i thinkfair planet of the night
that in thy orb the wretched may have rest
the sufferers of the earth perhaps may go
released by deathto thy benignant sphere
and the sad children of despair and woe
forget in thee their cup of sorrow here
oh that i soon may reach thy world serene
poor wearied pilgrimin this toiling scene


ah hills belovedwhere once a happy child
your beechen shades your turf your flowers among
i wove your bluebells into garlands wild
and woke your echoes with my artless song
ah hills belovedyour turf your flowers remain
but can they peace to this sad breast restore
for one poor moment soothe the sense of pain
and teach a breaking heart to throb no more
and you arunain the vale below
as to the sea your limpid waves you bear
can you one kind lethean cup bestow
to drink a long oblivion to my care
ah nowhen all een hopes last ray is gone
theres no oblivionbut in death alone


oh hope thou soother sweet of human woes
how shall i lure thee to my haunts forlorn
for me wilt thou renew the witherd rose
and clear my painful path of pointed thorn
ah come sweet nymph in smiles and softness drest
like the young hours that lead the tender year
enchantress come and charm my cares to rest
alas the flatterer flies and will not hear
a prey to fear anxiety and pain
must i a sad existence still deplore
lothe flowers fade but all the thorns remain
for me the vernal garland blooms no more
come then pale miserys love be thou my cure
and i will bless thee who though slow art sure
sweet poet of the woodsa long adieu
farewell soft minstrel of the early year
ah twill be long ere thou shalt sing anew
and pour thy music on the nights dull ear
whether on spring thy wandering flights await
or whether silent in our groves you dwell
the pensive muse shall own thee for her mate
and still protect the song she loves so well
with cautious step the lovelorn youth shall glide
thro the lone brake that shades thy mossy nest
and shepherd girls from eyes profane shall hide
the gentle bird who sings of pity best
for still thy voice shall soft affections move
and still be dear to sorrow and to love


again the wood and longwithdrawing vale
in many a tint of tender green are drest
where the young leaves unfolding scarce conceal
beneath their early shade the halfformd nest
of finch or woodlark and the primrose pale
and lavish cowslip wildly scatterd round
give their sweet spirits to the sighing gale
ah season of delightcould aught be found
to soothe awhile the tortured bosoms pain
of sorrows rankling shaft to cure the wound
and bring lifes first delusions once again
twere surely met in theethy prospect fair
thy sounds of harmony thy balmy air
have power to cure all sadnessbut despair


blest is yon shepherd on the turf reclined
who on the varied clouds which float above
lies idly gazingwhile his vacant mind
pours out some tale antique of rural love
ah he has never felt the pangs that move
th indignant spirit when with selfish pride
friends on whose faith the trusting heart relied
unkindly shun th imploring eye of woe
the ills they ought to soothe with taunts deride
and laugh at tears themselves have forced to flow
nor his rude bosom those fine feelings melt
children of sentiment and knowledge born
through whom each shaft with cruel force is felt
empoisond by deceitor barbd with scorn


ah why will memry with officious care
the long lost visions of my days renew
why paint the vernal landscape green and fair
when lifes gay dawn was opening to my view
ah wherefore bring those moments of delight
when with my anna on the southern shore
i thought the future as the present bright
ye dear delusionsye return no more
alas how diffrent does the truth appear
from the warm picture youths rash hand portrays
how fades the scene as we approach it near
and pain and sorrow strikehow many ways
yet of that tender heart ah still retain
a share for meand i will not complain


come balmy sleep tired natures soft resort
on these sad temples all thy poppies shed
and bid gay dreams from morpheus airy court
float in light vision round my aching head
secure of all thy blessings partial power
on his hard bed the peasant throws him down
and the poor seaboy in the rudest hour
enjoys thee more than he who wears a crown
claspd in her faithful shepherds guardian arms
well may the village girl sweet slumbers prove
and they o gentle sleep still taste thy charms
who wake to labour liberty and love
but still thy opiate aid dost thou deny
to calm the anxious breast to close the streaming eye


on some rude fragment of the rocky shore
where on the fractured cliff the billows break
musing my solitary seat i take
and listen to the deep and solemn roar


oer the dark waves the winds tempestuous howl
the screaming seabird quits the troubled sea
but the wild gloomy scene has charms for me
and suits the mournful temper of my soul


already shipwreckd by the storms of fate
like the poor mariner methinks i stand
cast on a rock who sees the distant land
from whence no succour comesor comes too late
faint and more faint are heard his feeble cries
till in the rising tide the exhausted sufferer dies


oh place me where the burning moon
forbids the witherd flower to blow
or place me in the frigid zone
on mountains of eternal snow
let me pursue the steps of fame
or povertys more tranquil road
let youths warm tide my veins inflame
or sixty winters chill my blood
though my fond soul to heaven were flown
or though on earth tis doomd to pine
prisoner or freeobscure or known
my heart oh laura still is thine
whateer my destiny may be
that faithful heart still burns for thee


loose to the wind her golden tresses streamd
forming bright waves with amorous zephyrs sighs
and though averted now her charming eyes
then with warm love and melting pity beamd
was i deceivedah surely nymph divine
that fine suffusion on thy cheek was love
what wonder then those beauteous tints should move
should fire this heart this tender heart of mine
thy soft melodious voice thy air thy shape
were of a goddessnot a mortal maid
yet though thy charms thy heavenly charms should fade
my heart my tender heart could not escape
nor cure for me in time or change be found
the shaft extracted does not cure the wound


where the green leaves exclude the summer beam
and softly bend as balmy breezes blow
and where with liquid lapse the lucid stream
across the fretted rock is heard to flow
pensive i lay when she whom earth conceals
as if still living to my eyes appears
and pitying heaven her angel form reveals
to sayunhappy petrarch dry your tears
ah why sad lover thus before your time
in grief and sadness should your life decay
and like a blighted flower your manly prime
in vain and hopeless sorrow fade away
ah yield not thus to culpable despair
but raise thine eyes to heavenand think i wait thee there


ye vales and woods fair scenes of happier hours
ye featherd people tenants of the grove
and you bright stream befringed with shrubs and flowers
behold my grief ye witnesses of love


for ye beheld my infant passion rise
and saw through years unchanged my faithful flame
now cold in dust the beauteous object lies
and you ye conscious scenes are still the same


while busy memory still delights to dwell
on all the charms these bitter tears deplore
and with a trembling hand describes too well
the angel form i shall behold no more
to heaven shes fled and nought to me remains
but the pale ashes which her urn contains


on thy grey bark in witness of my flame
i carve mirandas cypherbeauteous tree
graced with the lovely letters of her name
henceforth be sacred to my love and me
though the tall elm the oak and darker pine
with broader arms may noons fierce ardours break
to shelter me and her i love be thine
and thine to see her smile and hear her speak
no bird illomend round thy graceful head
shall clamour harsh or wave his heavy wing
but fern and flowers arise beneath thy shade
where the wild bees their lullabies shall sing
and in thy boughs the murmuring ringdove rest
and there the nightingale shall build her nest


wyndham tis not thy blood though pure it runs
through a long line of glorious ancestry
percys and seymours britains boasted sons
who trust the honours of their race to thee


tis not thy splendid domes where science loves
to touch the canvass and the bust to raise
thy rich domains fair fields and spreading groves
tis not all these the muse delights to praise


in birth and wealth and honours great thou art
but nobler in thy independent mind
and in that liberal hand and feeling heart
given thee by heavena blessing to mankind
unworthy oft may titled fortune be
a soul like thineis true nobility


for me the muse a simple band designd
of idle flowers that bloom the woods among
which with the cypress and the willow joind
a garland formd as artless as my song
and little dared i hope its transient hours
so long would last composed of buds so brief
till hayleys hand among the vagrant flowers
threw from his verdant crown a deathless leaf
for high in fames bright fane has judgment placed
the laurel wreath serenas poet won
which woven with myrtles by the hands of taste
the muse decreed for this her favourite son
and those immortal leaves his temples shade
whose fair eternal verdureshall not fade


on this blest day may no dark cloud or shower
with envious shade the suns bright influence hide
but all his rays illume the favourd hour
that saw thee maryhenrys lovely bride
with years revolving may it still arise
blest with each good approving heaven can send
and still with ray serene shall those blue eyes
enchant the husband and attach the friend
for you fair friendships amaranth shall blow
and loves own thornless roses bind your brow
and whenlong henceto happier worlds you go
your beauteous race shall be what you are now
and future nevills through long ages shine
with hearts as good and forms as fair as thine


go cruel tyrant of the human breast
to other hearts thy burning arrows bear
go where fond hope and fair illusion rest
ah why should love inhabit with despair
like the poor maniac i linger here
still haunt the scene where all my treasure lies
still seek for flowers where only thorns appear
and drink delicious poison from her eyes
towrds the deep gulf that opens on my sight
i hurry forward passions helpless slave
and scorning reasons mild and sober light
pursue the path that leads me to the grave
so round the flame the giddy insect flies
and courts the fatal fire by which it dies


oh solitude to thy sequesterd vale
i come to hide my sorrow and my tears
and to thy echoes tell the mournful tale
which scarce i trust to pitying friendships ears
amidst thy wildwoods and untrodden glades
no sounds but those of melancholy move
and the low winds that die among thy shades
seem like soft pitys sighs for hopeless love
and sure some story of despair and pain
in yon deep copse thy murmring doves relate
and hark methinks in that long plaintive strain
thine own sweet songstress weeps my wayward fate
ah nymph that fate assist me to endure
and bear awhilewhat death alone can cure


to thy bright beams i turn my swimming eyes
fair favourite planet which in happier days
saw my young hopes ah faithless hopesarise
and on my passion shed propitious rays
now nightly wandering mid the tempests drear
that howl the woods and rocky steeps among
i love to see thy sudden light appear
through the swift cloudsdriven by the wind along
or in the turbid water rude and dark
oer whose wild stream the gust of winter raves
thy trembling light with pleasure still i mark
gleam in faint radiance on the foaming waves
so oer my soul short rays of reason fly
then fadeand leave me to despair and die


make there my tomb beneath the limetrees shade
where grass and flowers in wild luxuriance wave
let no memorial mark where i am laid
or point to common eyes the lovers grave
but oft at twilight morn or closing day
the faithful friend with faultring step shall glide
tributes of fond regret by stealth to pay
and sigh oer the unhappy suicide
and sometimes when the sun with parting rays
gilds the long grass that hides my silent bed
the tear shall tremble in my charlottes eyes
dear precious dropsthey shall embalm the dead
yescharlotte oer the mournful spot shall weep
where her poor werterand his sorrows sleep


why should i wish to hold in this low sphere
a frail and feverish being wherefore try
poorly from day to day to linger here
against the powerful hand of destiny
by those who know the force of hopeless care
on the worn hearti sure shall be forgiven
if to elude dark guilt and dire despair
i go uncalldto mercy and to heaven
o thou to save whose peace i now depart
will thy soft mind thy poor lost friend deplore
when worms shall feed on this devoted heart
where even thy image shall be found no more
yet may thy pity mingle not with pain
for then thy hapless loverdies in vain


on thy wild banks by frequent torrents worn
no glittering fanes or marble domes appear
yet shall the mournful muse thy course adorn
and still to her thy rustic waves be dear
for with the infant otway lingering here
of early woes she bade her votary dream
while thy low murmurs soothd his pensive ear
and still the poetconsecrates the stream
beneath the oak and birch that fringe thy side
the firstborn violets of the year shall spring
and in thy hazles bending oer the tide
the earliest nightingale delight to sing
while kindred spirits pitying shall relate
thy otways sorrows and lament his fate


sighing i see yon little troop at play
by sorrow yet untouchd unhurt by care
while free and sportive they enjoy today
content and careless of tomorrows fare
o happy age when hopes unclouded ray
lights their green path and prompts their simple mirth
ere yet they feel the thorns that lurking lay
to wound the wretched pilgrims of the earth
making them rue the hour that gave them birth
and threw them on a world so full of pain
where prosperous folly treads on patient worth
and to deaf pride misfortune pleads in vain
ahfor their future fate how many fears
oppress my heartand fill mine eyes with tears


o thou whose name too often is profaned
whose charms celestial few have hearts to feel
unknown to follyand by pride disdaind
to thy soft solace may my sorrows steal
like the fair moon thy mild and genuine ray
through lifes long evening shall unclouded last
while pleasures frail attachments fleet away
as fades the rainbow from the northern blast
tis thine o nymph with balmy hands to bind
the wounds inflicted in misfortunes storm
and blunt severe afflictions sharpest dart
tis thy pure spirit warms my annas mind
beams through the pensive softness of her form
and holds its altaron her spotless heart


be the proud thames of trade the busy mart
arun to thee will other praise belong
dear to the lovers and the mourners heart
and ever sacred to the sons of song
thy banks romantic hopeless love shall seek
where oer the rocks the mantling bindwith flaunts
and sorrows drooping form and faded cheek
choose on thy willowd shore her lonely haunts
banks which inspired thy otways plaintive strain
wildswhose lorn echoes learned the deeper tone
of collins powerful shell yet once again
another poethayley is thine own
thy classic stream anew shall hear a lay
bright as its waves and various as its way


springs dewy hand on this fair summit weaves
the downy grass with tufts of alpine flowers
and shades the beechen slopes with tender leaves
and leads the shepherd to his upland bowers
strewn with wild thyme while slowdescending showers
feed the green ear and nurse the future sheaves
ah blest the hindwhom no sad thought bereaves
of the gay seasons pleasuresall his hours
to wholesome labour given or thoughtless mirth
no pangs of sorrow past or coming dread
bend his unconscious spirit down to earth
or chase calm slumbers from his careless head
ah what to me can those dear days restore
when scenes could charm that now i taste no more


when latest autumn spreads her evening veil
and the grey mists from these dim waves arise
i love to listen to the hollow sighs
through the halfleafless wood that breathes the gale
for at such hours the shadowy phantom pale
oft seems to fleet before the poets eyes
strange sounds are heard and mournful melodies
as of night wanderers who their woes bewail
here by his native stream at such an hour
pitys own otway i methinks could meet
and hear his deep sighs swell the saddend wind
o melancholysuch thy magic power
that to the soul these dreams are often sweet
and sooth the pensive visionary mind


go rural naiad wind thy stream along
through woods and wilds then seek the ocean caves
where seanymphs meet their coral rocks among
to boast the various honours of their waves
tis but a little oer thy shallow tide
that toiling trade her burdend vessel leads
but laurels grow luxuriant on thy side
and letters live along thy classic meads
lo where mid british bards thy natives shine
and now another poet helps to raise
thy glory highthe poet of the mine
whose brilliant talents are his smallest praise
and who to all that genius can impart
adds the cool head and the unblemishd heart


charmd by thy suffrage shall i yet aspire
all inauspicious as my fate appears
by troubles darkend that increase with years
to guide the crayon or to touch the lyre
ah methe sister muses still require
a spirit free from all intrusive fears
nor will they deign to wipe away the tears
of vain regret that dim their sacred fire
but when thy envied sanction crowns my lays
a ray of pleasure lights my languid mind
for well i know the value of thy praise
and to how few the flattering meed confined
that thoutheir highly favourd brows to bind
wilt weave green myrtle and unfading bays


nymph of the rock whose dauntless spirit braves
the beating storm and bitter winds that howl
round thy cold breast and hearst the bursting waves
and the deep thunder with unshaken soul
oh comeand show how vain the cares that press
on my weak bosomand how little worth
is the false fleeting meteor happiness
that still misleads the wanderers of the earth
strengthend by thee this heart shall cease to melt
oer ills that poor humanity must bear
nor friends estranged or ties dissolved be felt
to leave regret and fruitless anguish there
and when at length it heaves its latest sigh
thou and mild hope shall teach me how to die


should the lone wanderer fainting on his way
rest for a moment of the sultry hours
and though his path through thorns and roughness lay
pluck the wild rose or woodbines gadding flowers
weaving gay wreaths beneath some sheltering tree
the sense of sorrow he awhile may lose
so have i sought thy flowers fair poesy
so charmd my way with friendship and the muse
but darker now grows lifes unhappy day
dark with new clouds of evil yet to come
her pencil sickening fancy throws away
and weary hope reclines upon the tomb
and points my wishes to that tranquil shore
where the pale spectre care pursues no more


the poets fancy takes from floras realm
her buds and leaves to dress fictitious powers
with the green olive shades minervas helm
and give to beautys queen the queen of flowers
but what gay blossoms of luxuriant spring
with rose mimosa amaranth entwined
shall fabled sylphs and fairy people bring
as a just emblem of the lovely mind
in vain the mimic pencil tries to blend
the glowing dyes that dress the flowery race
scented and colourd by a hand divine
ah not less vainly would the muse pretend
on her weak lyre to sing the native grace
and native goodness of a soul like thine


when welcome slumber sets my spirit free
forth to fictitious happiness it flies
and where elysian bowers of bliss arise
i seem my emmelineto meet with thee
ah fancy then dissolving human ties
gives me the wishes of my soul to see
tears of fond pity fill thy softend eyes
in heavenly harmonyour hearts agree
alas these joys are mine in dreams alone
when cruel reason abdicates her throne
her harsh return condemns me to complain
through life unpitied unrelieved unknown
and as the dear delusions leave my brain
she bids the truth recurwith aggravated pain


i love thee mournful sobersuited night
when the faint moon yet lingering in her wane
and veild in clouds with pale uncertain light
hangs oer the waters of the restless main
in deep depression sunk the enfeebled mind
will to the deaf cold elements complain
and tell the embosomd grief however vain
to sullen surges and the viewless wind
though no repose on thy dark breast i find
i still enjoy theecheerless as thou art
for in thy quiet gloom the exhausted heart
is calm though wretched hopeless yet resigned
while to the winds and waves its sorrows given
may reachthough lost on earththe ear of heaven


far on the sands the low retiring tide
in distant murmurs hardly seems to flow
and oer the world of waters blue and wide
the sighing summer wind forgets to blow
as sinks the daystar in the rosy west
the silent wave with rich reflection glows
alas can tranquil nature give me rest
or scenes of beauty soothe me to repose
can the soft lustre of the sleeping main
yon radiant heaven or all creations charms
erase the written troubles of the brain
which memory tortures and which guilt alarms
or bid a bosom transient quiet prove
that bleeds with vain remorse and unextinguishd love


in this tumultuous sphere for thee unfit
how seldom art thou foundtranquillity
unless tis when with mild and downcast eye
by the low cradles thou delightst to sit
of sleeping infantswatching the soft breath
and bidding the sweet slumberers easy lie
or sometimes hanging oer the bed of death
where the poor languid suffererhopes to die
oh beauteous sister of the halcyon peace
i sure shall find thee in that heavenly scene
where care and anguish shall their power resign
where hope alike and vain regret shall cease
and memorylost in happiness serene
repeat no morethat misery has been mine


the dark and pillowy cloud the sallow trees
seem oer the ruins of the year to mourn
and cold and hollow the inconstant breeze
sobs through the falling leaves and witherd fern
oer the tall brow of yonder chalky bourn
the evening shades their gatherd darkness fling
while by the lingering light i scarce discern
the shrieking nightjar sail on heavy wing
ah yet a littleand propitious spring
crownd with fresh flowers shall wake the woodland strain
but no gay change revolving seasons bring
to call forth pleasure from the soul of pain
bid syren hope resume her longlost part
and chase the vulture carethat feeds upon the heart


the unhappy exile whom his fates confine
to the bleak coast of some unfriendly isle
cold barren desert where no harvests smile
but thirst and hunger on the rocks repine
when from some promontorys fearful brow
sun after sun he hopeless sees decline
in the broad shipless seaperhaps may know
such heartless pain such blank despair as mine
and if a flattering cloud appears to show
the fancied semblance of a distant sail
then melts awayanew his spirits fail
while the lost hope but aggravates his woe
ah so for me delusive fancy toils
then from contrasted truthmy feeble soul recoils


pressd by the moon mute arbitress of tides
while the loud equinox its power combines
the sea no more its swelling surge confines
but oer the shrinking land sublimely rides
the wild blast rising from the western cave
drives the huge billows from their heaving bed
tears from their grassy tombs the village dead
and breaks the silent sabbath of the grave
with shells and seaweed mingled on the shore
lo their bones whiten in the frequent wave
but vain to them the winds and waters rave
they hear the warring elements no more
while i am doomdby lifes long storm opprest
to gaze with envy on their gloomy rest


farewell arunaon whose varied shore
my early vows were paid to natures shrine
when thoughtless joy and infant hope were mine
and whose lorn stream has heard me since deplore
too many sorrows sighing i resign
thy solitary beautiesand no more
or on thy rocks or in thy woods recline
or on the heath by moonlight lingering pore
on airdrawn phantomswhile in fancys ear
as in the evening wind thy murmurs swell
the enthusiast of the lyre who wanderd here
seems yet to strike his visionary shell
of power to call forth pitys tenderest tear
or wake wild frenzyfrom her hideous cell


ye towers sublime deserted now and drear
ye woods deep sighing to the hollow blast
the musing wanderer loves to linger near
while history points to all your glories past
and startling from their haunts the timid deer
to trace the walks obscured by matted fern
which wallers soothing lyre were wont to hear
but where now clamours the discordant hern
the spoiling hand of time may overturn
these lofty battlements and quite deface
the fading canvass whence we love to learn
sydneys keen look and sacharissas grace
but fame and beauty still defy decay
saved by the historic pagethe poets tender lay


thee queen of shadowsshall i still invoke
still love the scenes thy sportive pencil drew
when on mine eyes the early radiance broke
which showd the beauteous rather than the true
alas long since those glowing tints are dead
and now tis thine in darkest hues to dress
the spot where pale experience hangs her head
oer the sad grave of murderd happiness
through thy false medium then no longer viewd
may fancied pain and fancied pleasure fly
and i as from me all thy dreams depart
be to my wayward destiny subdued
nor suffer perfection with a poets eye
nor suffer anguish with a poets heart


no more my wearied soul attempts to stray
from sad reality and vain regret
nor courts enchanting fiction to allay
sorrows that sense refuses to forget
for of calamity so long the prey
imagination now has lost her powers
nor will her fairy loom again essay
to dress affliction in a robe of flowers
but if no more the bowers of fancy bloom
let one superior scene attract my view
where heavens pure rays the sacred spot illume
let thy loved hand with palm and amaranth strew
the mournful path approaching to the tomb
while faiths consoling voice endears the friendly gloom


o thou who sleepst where hazlebands entwine
the vernal grass with paler violets drest
i would sweet maid thy humble bed were mine
and mine thy calm and enviable rest
for never more by human ills opprest
shall thy soft spirit fruitlessly repine
thou canst not now thy fondest hopes resign
even in the hour that should have made thee blest
light lies the turf upon thy virgin breast
and lingering here to love and sorrow true
the youth who once thy simple heart possest
shall mingle tears with aprils early dew
while still for him shall faithful memory save
thy form and virtues from the silent grave


farewell ye lawnsby fond remembrance blest
as witnesses of gay unclouded hours
where to maternal friendships bosom prest
my happy childhood past among your bowers
ye woodwalks wildwhere leaves and fairy flowers
by springs luxuriant hand are strewn anew
rockswhence with shadowy grace rude nature lowrs
oer glens and haunted streamsa long adieu
and youo promised happinesswhose voice
deluded fancy heard in every grove
bidding this tender trusting heart rejoice
in the bright prospect of unfailing love
though lost to mestill may thy smile serene
bless the dear lord of this regretted scene


on this lone island whose unfruitful breast
feeds but the summershepherds little flock
with scanty herbage from the halfclothed rock
where osprays cormorants and seamews rest
even in a scene so desolate and rude
i could with thee for months and years be blest
and of thy tenderness and love possest
find all my world in this wild solitude
when summer suns these northern seas illume
with thee admire the lights reflected charms
and when drear winter spreads his cheerless gloom
still find elysium in thy sheltring arms
for thou to me canst sovereign bliss impart
thy mind my empireand my throne thy heart


faultering and sad the unhappy pilgrim roves
who on the eve of bleak decembers night
divided far from all he fondly loves
journeys alone along the giddy height
of these steep cliffs and as the suns last ray
fades in the west sees from the rocky verge
dark tempests scowling oer the shortened day
and hears with ear appalld the impetuous surge
beneath him thunderso with heart oppressd
alone reluctant desolate and slow
by friendships cheering radiance now unblest
along lifes rudest path i seem to go
nor see where yet the anxious heart may rest
that trembling at the pastrecoils from future woe


the shivering native who by tenglios side
beholds with fond regret the parting light
sink far away beneath the darkening tide
and leave him to long months of dreary night
yet knows that springing from the eastern wave
the suns glad beams shall reillume his way
and from the snows securedwithin his cave
he waits in patient hopereturning day
not so the sufferer feels who oer the waste
of joyless life is destind to deplore
fond love forgotten tender friendship past
which once extinguishd can revive no more
oer the blank void he looks with hopeless pain
for him those beams of heaven shall never shine again


ye copses wild where april bids arise
the vernal grasses and the early flowers
my soul depressdfrom human converse flies
to the lone shelter of your pathless bowers
lowhere the woodman with his toil oppressd
his careless head on bark and moss reclined
lulld by the song of birds the murmuring wind
has sunk to calm though momentary rest
ah would twere mine in springs green lap to find
such transient respite from the ills i bear
would i could taste like this unthinking hind
a sweet forgetfulness of human care
till the last sleep these weary eyes shall close
and death receive me to his long repose


borne on the warm wing of the western gale
how tremulously low is heard to float
thro the green budding thorns that fringe the vale
the early nightingales prelusive note
tis hopes instinctive power that through the grove
tells how benignant heaven revives the earth
tis the soft voice of young and timid love
that calls these melting sounds of sweetness forth
with transport once sweet bird i haild thy lay
and bade thee welcome to our shades again
to charm the wandering poets pensive way
and soothe the solitary lovers pain
but nowsuch evils in my lot combine
as shut my languid senseto hopes dear voice and thine


if by his torturing savage foes untraced
the breathless captive gain some trackless glade
yet hears the warwhoop howl along the waste
and dreads the reptilemonsters of the shade
the giant reeds that murmur round the flood
seem to conceal some hideous form beneath
and every hollow blast that shakes the wood
speaks to his trembling heart of woe and death
with horror fraught and desolate dismay
on such a wanderer falls the starless night
but if far streaming a propitious ray
leads to some amicable fort his sight
he hails the beam benign that guides his way
as i my harriet bless thy friendships cheering light


dependence heavy heavy are thy chains
and happier they who from the dangerous sea
or the dark mine procure with ceaseless pains
a hardearnd pittancethan who trust to thee
more blest the hind who from his bed of flock
startswhen the birds of morn their summons give
and wakend by the lark the shepherds clock
lives but to labourlabouring but to live
more noble than the sycophant whose art
must heap with tawdry flowers thy hated shrine
i envy not the meed thou canst impart
to crown his servicewhile tho pride combine
with fraud to crush memy unfetterd heart
still to the mountain nymph may offer mine


when on some balmybreathing night of spring
the happy child to whom the world is new
pursues the evening moth of mealy wing
or from the heathbell beats the sparkling dew
he sees before his inexperienced eyes
the brilliant glowworm like a meteor shine
on the turfbankamazed and pleased he cries
star of the dewy grassi make thee mine
then ere he sleep collects the moistend flower
and bids soft leaves his glittering prize enfold
and dreams that fairylamps illume his bower
yet with the morning shudders to behold
his lucid treasure rayless as the dust
so turn the worlds bright joys to cold and blank disgust


what awful pageants crowd the evening sky
the low horizon gathering vapours shroud
sudden from many a deepembattled cloud
terrific thunders burst and lightnings fly
while in serenest azure beaming high
nights regent of her calm pavilion proud
gilds the dark shadows that beneath her lie
unvexd by all their conflicts fierce and loud
so in unsullied dignity elate
a spirit conscious of superior worth
in placid elevation firmly great
scorns the vain cares that give contention birth
and blest with peace above the shocks of fate
smiles at the tumult of the troubled earth


thou spectre of terrific mien
lord of the hopeless heart and hollow eye
in whose fierce train each form is seen
that drives sick reason to insanity
i woo thee with unusual prayer
grim visaged comfortless despair
approach in me a willing victim find
who seeks thine iron swayand calls thee kind
ah hide for ever from my sight
the faithless flatterer hopewhose pencil gay
portrays some vision of delight
then bids the fairy tablet fade away


while in dire contrast to mine eyes
thy phantoms yet more hideous rise
and memory draws from pleasures witherd flower
corrosives for the heartof fatal power


i bid the traitor love adieu
who to this fond believing bosom came
a guest insidious and untrue
with pitys soothing voicein friendships name
the wounds he gave nor time shall cure
nor reason teach me to endure
and to that breast mild patience pleads in vain
which feels the curseof meriting its pain


yet not to me tremendous power
thy worst of spiritwounding pangs impart
with which in dark convictions hour
thou strikst the guilty unrepentant heart
but of illusion long the sport
that dreary tranquil gloom i court
where my past errors i may still deplore
and dream of longlost happiness no more


to thee i give this tortured breast
where hope arises but to foster pain
ah lull its agonies to rest
ah let me never be deceived again
but callous in thy deep repose
behold in long array the woes
of the dread future calm and undismayd
till i may claim the hopethat shall not fade


dark gathering clouds involve the threatening skies
the sea heaves conscious of the impending gloom
deep hollow murmurs from the cliffs arise
they comethe spirits of the tempest come


oh may such terrors mark the approaching night
as reignd on that these streaming eyes deplore
flash ye red fires of heaven with fatal light
and with conflicting winds ye waters roar


loud and more loud ye foaming billows burst
ye warring elements more fiercely rave
till the wide waves oerwhelm the spot accurst
where ruthless avarice finds a quiet grave


thus with claspd hands wild looks and streaming hair
while shrieks of horror broke her trembling speech
a wretched maidthe victim of despair
surveyd the threatening storm and desert beech


then to the tomb where now the father slept
whose rugged nature bade her sorrows flow
frantic she turndand beat her breast and wept
invoking vengeance on the dust below


lo rising there above each humbler heap
yon cypherd stones his name and wealth relate
who gave his sonremorselessto the deep
while i his living victim curse my fate


oh my lost love no tomb is placed for thee
that may to strangers eyes thy worth impart
thou hast no grave but in the stormy sea
and no memorial but this breaking heart


forth to the world a widowd wanderer driven
i pour to winds and waves the unheeded tear
try with vain effort to submit to heaven
and fruitless call on himwho cannot hear


oh might i fondly clasp him once again
while oer my head the infuriate billows pour
forget in death this agonizing pain
and feel his fathers cruelty no more


part raging waters part and show beneath
in your dread caves his pale and mangled form
now while the demons of despair and death
ride on the blast and urge the howling storm


lo by the lightnings momentary blaze
i see him rise the whitening waves above
no longer such as when in happier days
he gave the enchanted hoursto me and love


such as when daring the enchafed sea
and courting dangerous toil he often said
that every peril one soft smile from me
one sigh of speechless tenderness oerpaid


but dead disfigured while between the roar
of the loud waves his accents pierce mine ear
and seem to sayah wretch delay no more
but come unhappy mournermeet me here


yet powerful fancy bid the phantom stay
still let me hear himtis already past
along the waves his shadow glides away
i lose his voice amid the deafening blast


ah wild delusion born of frantic pain
he hears not comes not from his watery bed
my tears my anguish my despair are vain
the insatiate ocean gives not up its dead


tis not his voice hark the deep thunders roll
upheaves the ground the rocky barriers fail
approach ye horrors that delight my soul
despair and death and desolation hail


the ocean hearsthe embodied waters come
rise oer the land and with resistless sweep
tear from its base the proud aggressors tomb
and bear the injured to eternal sleep


fruit of auroras tears fair rose
on whose soft leaves fond zephyrs play
oh queen of flowers thy buds disclose
and give thy fragrance to the day
unveil thy transient charmsah no
a little be thy bloom delayd
since the same hour that bids thee blow
shall see thee droop thy languid head


but go and on themiras breast
find happy flower thy throne and tomb
while jealous of a fate so blest
how shall i envy thee thy doom
should some rude hand approach thee there
guard the sweet shrine thou wilt adorn
ah punish those who rashly dare
and for my rivals keep thy thorn


love shall himself thy boughs compose
and bid thy wanton leaves divide
hell show thee how my lovely rose
to deck her bosom not to hide
and thou shalt tell the cruel maid
how frail are youth and beautys charms
and teach her ere her own shall fade
to give them to her lovers arms


when jove in anger to the sons of the earth
bid artful vulcan give pandora birth
and sent the fatal gift which spread below
oer all the wretched race contagious woe
unhappy man by vice and folly tost
found in the storms of life his quiet lost
while envy avarice and ambition hurld
discord and death around the warring world
then the blest peasant left his fields and fold
and barterd love and peace for power and gold


left his calm cottage and his native plain
in search of wealth to tempt the faithless main
or braving danger in the battle stood
and bathed his savage hands in human blood
no longer then his woodland walks among
the shepherd lad his genuine passion sung
or sought at early morn his souls delight
or graved her name upon the bark at night
to deck her flowing hair no more he wove
the simple wreath or with ambitious love
bound his own brow with myrtle or with bay
but broke his pipe or threw his crook away
the nymphs forsaken other pleasures sought
then first for gold their venal hearts were bought


and natures blush to sickly art gave place
and affectation seized the seat of grace
no more simplicity by sense refined
or generous sentiment possessd the mind
no more they felt each others joy and woe
and cupid fled and hid his useless bow
but with deep grief propitious venus pined
to see the ills which threatend womankind


ills that she knew her empire would disarm
and rob her subjects of their sweetest charm
good humours potent influence destroy
and change for lowering frowns the smile of joy
then deeply sighing at the mournful view
she tried at length what heavenly art could do


to bring back pleasure to her pensive train
and vindicate the glories of her reign
a thousand little loves attend the task
and bear from marss head his radiant casque
the fair enchantress on its silver bound
weaved with soft spells her magic cestus round
then shaking from her hair ambrosial dew
infused fair hope and expectation new
and stifled wishes and persuasive sighs
and fond belief and eloquence of eyes


and faltring accents which explain so well
what studied speeches vainly try to tell
and more pathetic silence which imparts
infectious tenderness to feeling hearts
soft tones of pity fascinating smiles
and maias son assisted her with wiles
and brought gay dreams fantastic visions brought
and waved his wand oer the seducing draught


then zephyr came to him the goddess cried
go fetch from flora all her flowery pride
to fill my charm each scented bud that blows
and bind my myrtles with her thornless rose
then speed thy flight to gallias smiling plain
where rolls the loire the garonne and the seine
dip in their waters thy celestial wing
and the soft dew to fill my chalice bring


but chiefly tell thy flora that to me
she send a bouquet of her fleurs de lys
that poignant spirit will complete my spell
tis done the lovely sorceress says tis well
and now apollo lends a ray of fire
the caldron bubbles and the flames aspire
the watchful graces round the circle dance
with arms entwined to mark the works advance
and with full quiver sportive cupid came
tempring his favourite arrows in the flame
then venus speaks the wavering flames retire
and zephyrs breath extinguishes the fire


at length the goddess in the helmets round
a sweet and subtile spirit duly found
more soft than oil than ether more refined
of power to cure the woes of womankind
and calld it flatterybalm of female life
it charms alike the widow maid and wife
clears the sad brow of virgins in despair
and smooths the cruel traces left by care


bids palsied age with youthful spirit glow
and hangs mays garlands on decembers snow
delicious essence howsoeer applied
by what rude nature is thy charm denied


some form seducing still thy whisper wears
stern wisdom turns to thee her willing ears
and prudery listens and forgets her fears


the rustic nymph whom rigid aunts restrain
condemnd to dress and practise airs in vain
at thy first summons finds her bosom swell
and bids her crabbed gouvernantes farewell


while fired by thee with spirit not her own
she grows a toast and rises into ton
the faded beauty who with secret pain
sees younger charms usurp her envied reign
by thee assisted can with smiles behold
the record where her conquests are enrolld
and dwelling yet on scenes by memory nursed
when george the second reignd or george the first
she sees the shades of ancient beaux arise
who swear her eyes exceeded modern eyes
when poets sung for her and lovers bled
and giddy fashion followd as she led


departed modes appear in long array
the flowers and flounces of her happier day
again her locks the decent fillets bind
the waving lappet flutters in the wind
and then comparing with a proud disdain
the more fantastic tastes that now obtain
she deems ungraceful trifling and absurd
the gayer world that moves round george the third


nor thy soft influence will the train refuse
who court in distant shades the modest muse
though in a form more pure and more refined
thy soothing spirit meets the letterd mind
not death itself thine empire can destroy
towrds thee even then we turn the languid eye
still trust in thee to bid our memory bloom
and scatter roses round the silent tomb


where cliffs arise by winter crownd
and through dark groves of pine around
down the deep chasms the snowfed torrents foam
within some hollow shelterd from the storms
the peasant of the alps his cottage forms
and builds his humble happy home


unenvied is the rich domain
that far beneath him on the plain
waves its wide harvests and its olive groves
more dear to him his hut with plantain thatchd
where long his unambitious heart attachd
finds all he wishes all he loves


there dwells the mistress of his heart
and love who teaches every art
has bid him dress the spot with fondest care
when borrowing from the vale its fertile soil
he climbs the precipice with patient toil
to plant her favourite flowerets there


with native shrubs a hardy race
there the green myrtle finds a place
and roses there the dewy leaves decline
while from the crags abrupt and tangled steeps
with bloom and fruit the alpine berry peeps
and blushing mingles with the vine


his gardens simple produce stored
prepared for him by hands adored
is all the little luxury he knows
and by the same dear hands are softly spread
the chamois velvet spoil that forms the bed
where in her arms he finds repose


but absent from the calm abode
dark thunder gathers round his road
wild raves the wind the arrowy lightnings flash
returning quick the murmuring rocks among
his faint heart trembling as he winds along
alarmdhe listens to the crash


of rifted iceoh man of woe
oer his dear cota mass of snow
by the storm severd from the cliff above
has fallenand buried in its marble breast
all that for himlost wretchthe world possest
his home his happiness his love


aghast the heartstruck mourner stands
glazed are his eyesconvulsed his hands
oerwhelming anguish checks his labouring breath
crushd by despairs intolerable weight
frantic he seeks the mountains giddiest height
and headlong seeks relief in death


a fate too similar is mine
but iin lingering pain repine
and still my lost felicity deplore
cold cold to me is that dear breast become
where this poor heart had fondly fixd its home
and love and happiness are mine no more


does pity give though fate denies
and to my wounds her balm impart
o speakwith those expressive eyes
let one low sigh escape thine heart


the gazing crowd shall never guess
what anxious watchful love can see
nor know what those soft looks express
nor dream that sign is meant for me


ah words are useless words are vain
thy generous sympathy to prove
and well that sign those looks explain
that clara mourns my hapless love


in early youths unclouded scene
the brilliant morning of eighteen
with health and sprightly joy elate
we gazed on lifes enchanting spring
nor thought how quickly time would bring
the mournful periodthirtyeight


then the starch maid or matron sage
already at the sober age
we viewd with mingled scorn and hate
in whose sharp words or sharper face
with thoughtless mirth we loved to trace
the sad effects ofthirtyeight


till saddening sickening at the view
we learnd to dread what time might do
and then preferrd a prayer to fate
to end our days ere that arrived
when power and pleasure long survived
we met neglect andthirtyeight


but time in spite of wishes flies
and fate our simple prayer denies
and bids us deaths own hour await
the auburn locks are mixd with grey
the transient roses fade away
but reason comes atthirtyeight


her voice the anguish contradicts
that dying vanity inflicts
her hand new pleasures can create
for us she opens to the view
prospects less brightbut far more true
and bids us smile atthirtyeight


no more shall scandals breath destroy
the social converse we enjoy
with bard or critic tete a tete
oer youths bright blooms her blights shall pour
but spare the improving friendly hour
that science gives to thirtyeight


strippd of their gaudy hues by truth
we view the glittring toys of youth
and blush to think how poor the bait
for which to public scenes we ran
and scornd of sober sense the plan
which gives content atthirtyeight


though times inexorable sway
has torn the myrtle bands away
for other wreaths tis not too late
the amaranths purple glow survives
and still minervas olive lives
on the calm brow ofthirtyeight


with eye more steady we engage
to contemplate approaching age
and life more justly estimate
with firmer souls and stronger powers
with reason faith and friendship ours
well not regret the stealing hours
that lead from thirtyeven to fortyeight


oerwhelmd with sorrow and sustaining long
the proud mans contumely th oppressors wrong
languid despondency and vain regret
must my exhausted spirit struggle yet
yesrobbd myself of all that fortune gave
even of all hopebut shelter in the grave
still shall the plaintive lyre essay its powers
to dress the cave of care with fancys flowers
maternal love the fiend despair withstand
still animate the heart and guide the hand


may you dear objects of my anxious care
escape the evils i was born to bear
round my devoted head while tempests roll
yet there where i have treasured up my soul
may the soft rays of dawning hope impart
reviving patience to my fainting heart
and when its sharp solicitudes shall cease
may i be conscious in the realms of peace


that every tear which swells my childrens eyes
from sorrows past not present ills arise
then with some friend who loves to share your pain
for tis my boast that some such friends remain
by filial grief and fond remembrance prest
youll seek the spot where all my sorrows rest
recall my hapless days in sad review
the long calamities i bore for you
and with a happier fate resolve to prove
how well you merited your mothers love


miranda mark where shrinking from the gale
its silken leaves yet moist with early dew
that fair faint flower the lily of the vale
droops its meek head and looks methinks like you
wrappd in a shadowy veil of tender green
its snowy bells a soft perfume dispense
and bending as reluctant to be seen
in simple loveliness it sooths the sense
with bosom bared to meet the garish day
the glaring tulip gaudy undismayd
offends the eye of taste that turns away
to seek the lily in her fragrant shade
with such unconscious beauty pensive mild
miranda charmsnatures soft modest child


illomend bird whose cries portentous float
oer yon savannah with the mournful wind
while as the indian hears your piercing note
dark dread of future evil fills his mind
wherefore with early lamentation break
the dear delusive visions of repose
why from so short felicity awake
my wounded senses to substantial woes
oer my sick soul thus rousd from transient rest
pale superstition sheds her influence drear
and to my shuddering fancy would suggest
thou comst to speak of evry woe i fear
ah reason little oer the soul prevails
when from ideal ill the enfeebled spirit fails


while thus i wander cheerless and unblest
and find in change of place but change of pain
in tranquil sleep the village labourers rest
and taste that quiet i pursue in vain
hushd is the hamlet now and faintly gleam
the dying embers from the casement low
of the thatchd cottage while the moons wan beam
lends a new lustre to the dazzling snow
oer the cold waste amid the freezing night
scarce heeding whither desolate i stray
for me pale eye of evening thy soft light
leads to no happy home my weary way
ends but in sad vicissitudes of care
i only fly from doubtto meet despair


oer faded heathflowers spun or thorny furze
the filmy gossamer is lightly spread
waving in every sighing air that stirs
as fairy fingers had entwined the thread
a thousand trembling orbs of lucid dew
spangle the texture of the fairy loom
as if soft sylphs lamenting as they flew
had wept departed summers transient bloom
but the wind rises and the turf receives
the glittering webso evanescent fade
bright views that youth with sanguine heart believes
so vanish schemes of bliss by fancy made
which fragile as the fleeting dreams of morn
leave but the witherd heath and barren thorn


here from the restless bed of lingering pain
the languid sufferer seeks the tepid wave
and feels returning health and hope again
disperse the gathering shadows of the grave
and here romantic rocks that boldly swell
fringed with green woods or staind with veins of ore
calld native genius forth whose heaventaught skill
charmd the deep echoes of the rifted shore
but tepid waves wild scenes or summer air
restore they palsied fancy woedeprest
check they the torpid influence of despair
or bid warm health reanimate the breast
where hopes soft visions have no longer part
and whose sad inmateis a broken heart


in happier hours ere yet so keenly blew
adversitys cold blight and bitter storms
luxuriant summers evanescent forms
and springs soft blooms with pencil light i drew
but as the lovely family of flowers
shrink from the bleakness of the northern blast
so fail from present care and sorrow past
the slight botanic pencils mimic powers
nor will kind fancy even by memorys aid
her visionary garlands now entwine
yet while the wreaths of hope and pleasure fade
still is one flower of deathless blossom mine
that dares the lapse of time and tempest rude
the unfading amaranth of gratitude


the nightflood rakes upon the stony shore
along the rugged cliffs and chalky caves
mourns the hoarse ocean seeming to deplore
all that are buried in his restless waves
mined by corrosive tides the hollow rock
falls prone and rushing from its turfy height
shakes the broad beach with longresounding shock
loud thundering on the ear of sullen night
above the desolate and stormy deep
gleams the wan moon by floating mist opprest
yet here while youth and health and labour sleep
alone i wandercalm untroubled rest
natures soft nurse deserts the highswoln breast
and shuns the eyes that only make to weep


swift fleet the billowy clouds along the sky
earth seems to shudder at the storm aghast
while only beings as forlorn as i
court the chill horrors of the howling blast
even round yon crumbling walls in search of food
the ravenous owl foregoes his evening flight
and in his cave within the deepest wood
the fox eludes the tempest of the night
but to my heart congenial is the gloom
which hides me from a world i wish to shun
that scene where ruin saps the mouldering tomb
suits with the sadness of a wretch undone
nor is the deepest shade the keenest air
black as my fate or cold as my despair


fall dews of heaven upon my burning breast
bathe with cool drops these everstreaming eyes
ye gentle winds that fan the balmy west
with the soft rippling tide of morning rise
and calm my bursting heart as here i keep
the vigil of the wretchednow away
fade the pale stars as wavering oer the deep
soft rosy tints announce another day
the day of middle summerah in vain
to those who mourn like me does radiant june
lead on her fragrant hours for hopeless pain
darkens with sullen clouds the sun of noon
and veild in shadows natures face appears
to hearts oerwhelmd with grief to eyes suffused with tears


clouds gold and purple oer the western ray
threw a bright veil and catching lights between
fell on the glancing sail that we had seen
with soft but adverse winds throughout the day
contending vainly as the vessel nears
increasing numbers hail it from the shore
lo on the deck a pallid form appears
half wondering to behold himself once more
approach his homeand now he can discern
his cottage thatch amid surrounding trees
yet trembling dreads lest sorrow or disease
await him there embittering his return
but all he loves are safe with heart elate
though poor and plunderd he absolves his fate


is there a solitary wretch who hies
to the tall cliff with starting pace or slow
and measuring views with wild and hollow eyes
its distance from the waves that chide below
who as the seaborn gale with frequent sighs
chills his cold bed upon the mountain turf
with hoarse half utterd lamentation lies
murmuring responses to the dashing surf
in moody sadness on the giddy brink
i see him more with envy than with fear
he has no nice felicities that shrink
from giant horrors wildly wandering here
he seems uncursed with reason not to know
the depth or the duration of his woe


the chill waves whiten in the sharp northeast
cold cold the nightblast comes with sullen sound
and black and gloomy like my cheerless breast
frowns the dark pier and lonely seaview round
yet a few monthsand on the peopled strand
pleasure shall all her varied forms display
nymphs lightly tread the bright reflecting sand
and proud sails whiten all the summer bay
then from these winds that whistle keen and bleak
musics delightful melodies shall float
oer the blue waters but tis mine to seek
rather some unfrequented shade remote
from sights and sounds of gaietyi mourn
all that gave me delightah never to return


thee lucid arbiter twixt day and night
the seaman greets as on the ocean stream
reflected thy precursive friendly beam
points out the longsought haven to his sight
watching for thee the lovers ardent eyes
turn to the eastern hills and as above
thy brilliance trembles hails the lights that rise
to guide his footsteps to expecting love
i mark thee too as nights dark clouds retire
and thy bright radiance glances on the sea
but never more shall thy heraldic fire
speak of approaching morn with joy to me
quenchd in the gloom of death that heavenly ray
once lent to light me on my thorny way


thou whom prosperity has always led
oer level paths with moss and flowrets strewn
for whom she still prepares a downy bed
with roses scatterd and to thorns unknown
wilt thou yet murmur at a misplaced leaf
think ere thy irritable nerves repine
how many born with feelings keen as thine
taste all the sad vicissitudes of grief
how many steep in tears their scanty bread
or lost to reason sorrows victims rave
how many know not where to lay their head
while some are driven by anguish to the grave
think nor impatient at a feathers weight
mar the uncommon blessings of thy fate


sleep that knits up the ravelld sleeve of care
forsakes me while the chill and sullen blast
as my sad soul recalls its sorrows past
seems like a summons bidding me prepare
for the last sleep of deathmurmuring i hear
the hollow wind around the ancient towers
while night and silence reign and cold and drear
the darkest gloom of middle winter lowers
but wherefore fear existence such as mine
to change for long and undisturbd repose
ah when this suffering being i resign
and oer my miseries the tomb shall close
by her whose loss in anguish i deplore
i shall be laid and feel that loss no more


where the wild woods and pathless forests frown
the darkling pilgrim seeks his unknown way
till on the grass he throws him weary down
to wait in broken sleep the dawn of day
through boughs just waving in the silent air
with pale capricious light the summer moon
chequers his humid couch while fancy there
that loves to wanton in the nights deep noon
calls from the mossy roots and fountain edge
fair visionary nymphs that haunt the shade
or naiads rising from the whispering sedge
and mid the beauteous group his dear loved maid
seems beckoning him with smiles to join the train
then starting from his dream he feels his woes again


go now ingenious youththe trying hour
is come the world demands that thou shouldst go
to active life there titles wealth and power
may all be purchasedyet i joy to know
thou wilt not pay their price the base control
of petty despots in their pedant reign
already hast thou feltand high disdain
of tyrants is imprinted on thy soul
not where mistaken glory in the field
rears her red banner be thou ever found
but against proud oppression raise the shield
of patriot daringso shalt thou renownd
for the best virtues live or that denied
mayst die as hampden or as sydney died


small viewless aeronaut that by the line
of gossamer suspended in mid air
floatst on a sun beamliving atom where
ends thy breezeguided voyagewith what design
in ether dost thou launch thy form minute
mocking the eyealas before the veil
of denser clouds shall hide thee the pursuit
of the keen swift may end thy fairy sail
thus on the golden thread that fancy weaves
buoyant as hopes illusive flattery breathes
the young and visionary poet leaves
lifes dull realities while sevenfold wreaths
of rainbowlight around his head revolve
ah soon at sorrows touch the radiant dreams dissolve


wan heralds of the sun and summer gale
that seem just fallen from infant zephyrs wing
not now as once with heart revived i hail
your modest buds that for the brow of spring
form the first simple garlandnow no more
escaping for a moment all my cares
shall i with pensive silent step explore
the woods yet leafless where to chilling airs
your green and pencild blossoms trembling wave
ah ye soft transient children of the ground
more fair was she on whose untimely grave
flow my unceasing tears their varied round
the seasons go while i through all repine
for fixd regret and hopeless grief are mine


of folly weary shrinking from the view
of violence and fraud allowd to take
all peace from humble life i would forsake
their haunts for ever and sweet nymph with you
find shelter where my tired and tearswollen eyes
among your silent shades of soothing hue
your bells and florrets of unnumberd dyes
might restand learn the bright varieties
that from your lovely hands are fed with dew
and every veined leaf that trembling sighs
in mead or woodland or in wilds remote
or lurk with mosses in the humid caves
mantle the cliffs on dimpling rivers float
or stream from coral rocks beneath the oceans waves


dark and conceald art thou soft evenings queen
and melancholys votaries that delight
to watch thee gliding through the blue serene
now vainly seek thee on the brow of night
mild sorrow such as hope has not forsook
may love to muse beneath thy silent reign
but i prefer from some steep rock to look
on the obscure and fluctuating main
what time the martial star with lurid glare
portentous gleams above the troubled deep
or the red comet shakes his blazing hair
or on the firetingd waves the lightnings leap
while thy fair beams illume another sky
and shine for beings less accursed than i


he may be envied who with tranquil breast
can wander in the wild and woodland scene
when summers glowing hands have newly dressd
the shadowy forests and the copses green
who unpursued by care can pass his hours
where briony and woodbine fringe the trees
on thymy banks reposing while the bees
murmur their fairy tunes in praise of flowers
or on the rock with ivy clad and fern
that overhangs the ozierwhispering bed
of some clear current bid his wishes turn
from this bad world and by calm reason led
knows in refined retirement to possess
by friendship hallowdrural happiness


mute is thy wild harp now o bard sublime
who amid scotias mountain solitude
great nature taught to build the lofty rhyme
and even beneath the daily pressure rude
of labouring poverty thy generous blood
fired with the love of freedomnot subdued
wert thou by thy low fortune but a time
like this we live in when the abject chime
of echoing parasite is best approved
was not for theeindignantly is fled
thy noble spirit and no longer moved
by all the ills oer which thine heart has bled
associate worthy of the illustrious dead
enjoys with them the liberty it loved


the upland shepherd as reclined he lies
on the soft turf that clothes the mountain brow
marks the bright sealine mingling with the skies
or from his course celestial sinking slow
the summersun in purple radiance low
blaze on the western waters the wide scene
magnificent and tranquil seems to spread
even oer the rustics breast a joy serene
when like dark plaguespots by the demons shed
charged deep with death upon the waves far seen
move the warfreighted ships and fierce and red
flash their destructive firesthe mangled dead
and dying victims then pollute the flood
ah thus man spoils heavens glorious works with blood


wilt thou forsake me who in lifes bright may
lent warmer lustre to the radiant morn
and even oer summer scenes by tempests torn
shed with illusive light the dewy ray
of pensive pleasure wilt thou while the day
of saddening autumn closes as i mourn
in languid hopeless sorrow far away
bend thy soft step and never more return
crushd to the earth by bitterest anguish pressd
from my faint eyes thy graceful form recedes
thou canst not heal a heart like mine that bleeds
but when in quiet earth that heart shall rest
haply mayst thou one sorrowing vigil keep
where pity and remembrance bend and weep


swells then thy feeling heart and streams thine eye
oer the deserted being poor and old
whom cold reluctant parish charity
consigns to mingle with his kindred mould


mournst thou that here the timeworn sufferer ends
those evil days still threatening woes to come
here where the friendless feel no want of friends
where even the houseless wanderer finds a home


what though no kindred crowd in sable forth
and sigh or seem to sigh around his bier
though oer his coffin with the humid earth
no children drop the unavailing tear


rather rejoice that here his sorrows cease
whom sickness age and poverty oppressd
where death the leveller restores to peace
the wretch who living knew not where to rest


rejoice that though an outcast spurnd by fate
through penurys rugged path his race he ran
in earths cold bosom equalld with the great
death vindicates the insulted rights of man


rejoice that though severe his earthly doom
and rude and sown with thorns the way he trod
now where unfeeling fortune cannot come
he rests upon the mercies of his god


novembers chill blast on the rough beach is howling
the surge breaks afar and then foams to the shore
dark clouds oer the sea gather heavy and scowling
and the white cliffs reecho the wild wintry roar


beneath that chalk rock a fair stranger reclining
has found on damp seaweed a cold lonely seat
her eyes filld with tears and her heart with repining
she starts at the billows that burst at her feet


there day after day with an anxious heart heaving
she watches the waves where they mingle with air
for the sail which alas all her fond hopes deceiving
may bring only tidings to add to her care


loose stream to wild winds those fair flowing tresses
once woven with garlands of gay summer flowers
her dress unregarded bespeaks her distresses
and beauty is blighted by griefs heavy hours


her innocent children unconscious of sorrow
to seek the glossd shell or the crimson weed stray
amused with the present they heed not tomorrow
nor think of the storm that is gathering today


the gilt fairy ship with its ribbon sail spreading
they launch on the salt pool the tide left behind
ah victimsfor whom their sad mother is dreading
the multiplied miseries that wait on mankind


to fair fortune born she beholds them with anguish
now wanderers with her on a once hostile soil
perhaps doomd for life in chill penury to languish
or abject dependence or soulcrushing toil


but the seaboat her hopes and her terrors renewing
oer the dim grey horizon now faintly appears
she flies to the quay dreading tidings of ruin
all breathless with haste half expiring with fears


poor mourneri would that my fortune had left me
the means to alleviate the woes i deplore
but like thine my hard fate has of affluence bereft me
i can warm the cold heart of the wretched no more


when in a thousand swarms the summer oer
the birds of passage quit our english shore
by various routs the featherd myriad moves
the beccafica seeks italian groves
no more a wheatear while the soaring files
of seafowl gather round the hebrid isles


but if by birdlime touchd unplumed confined
some poor illfated straggler stays behind
driven from his transient perch beneath your eaves
on his unshelterd head the tempest raves
while drooping round redoubling every pain
his mate and nestlings ask his help in vain


so we the buskin and the sock who wear
and strut and fret our little season here
dismissd at length as fortune bids divide
some lucky rogues sit down on thamess side
others to liffys western banks proceed
and somedriven far afield across the tweed
but piniond here alas i cannot fly
the hapless unplumed lingering straggler i
unless the healing pity you bestow
shall imp my shatterd wings and let me go


hard is his fate whom evil stars have led
to seek in scenic art precarious bread
while still through wild vicissitudes afloat
a hero now and now a sans culotte
that eleemosynary bread he gains
mingling with real distresses mimic pains


see in our group a pale lank falstaff stare
much needs he stuffingwhile young ammon there
rehearsesin a garretten feet square
and as his soft statira sighs consent
roxana comes notbut a dun for rent
here shivring edgar in his blanket rolld
exclaimswith too much reason toms acold
and vainly tries his sorrows to divert
while goneril or regan wash his shirt


lo fresh from calais edward mighty king
revolvesa mutton chop upon a string
and hotspur plucking honour from the moon
feeds a sick infant with a pewter spoon


more blessd the fisher who undaunted braves
in his small bark the impetuous winds and waves
for though he plough the sea when others sleep
he draws like glendower spirits from the deep


and while the storm howls round amidst his trouble
bright moonshine still illuminates the cobble
pale with her fears for him some fair poissarde
watches his nearing boat with fond regard
smiles when she sees his little canvass handing
and clasps her dripping lover on his landing


more blessd the peasant who with nervous toil
hews the rough oak or breaks the stubborn soil
weary indeed he sees the evening come
but then the rude yet tranquil hut his home
receives its rustic inmate then are his
secure repose and dear domestic bliss
the orchards blushing fruit the gardens store
the pendant hop that mantles round the door
are hisand while cheerful faggots burn
his lisping children hail their sites return


but wandering players unhouseld unanneald
and unappointed scour lifes common field
a flying squadrondisappointments cross em
and the campaign concludes perhaps at horsham


oh ye whose timely bounty deigns to shed
compassions balm upon my luckless head
benevolence with warm and glowing breast
and soft celestial mercy doubly blessd
smile on the generous actwhere means are given
to aid the wretchedis to merit heaven


whateer of praise and of regret attend
the grateful servant and the humble friend
where strict integrity and worth unite
to raise the lowly in their makers sight


are hers whose faithful service long approved
wept by the mistress whom through life she loved
here ends her earthly task in joyful trust
to share the eternal triumph of the just


chaotic pile of barren stone
that natures hurrying hand has thrown
half finishd from the troubled waves
on whose rude brow the rifted tower
has frownd through many a stormy hour
on this drear site of tempestbeaten graves


sure desolation loves to shroud
his giant form within the cloud
that hovers round thy rugged head
and as through broken vaults beneath
the future storms lowmuttering breathe
hears the complaining voices of the dead


here marks the fiend with eager eyes
far out at sea the fogs arise
that dimly shade the beacond strand
and listens the portentous roar
of sullen waves as on the shore
monotonous they burst and tell the storm at hand


northward the demons eyes are cast
oer yonder bare and sterile waste
where born to hew and heave the block
man lost in ignorance and toil
becomes associate to the soil
and his heart hardens like his native rock


on the bleak hills with flint oerspread
no blossoms rear the purple head
no shrub perfumes the zephyrs breath
but oer the cold and cheerless down
grim desolation seems to frown
blasting the ungrateful soil with partial death


here the scathed trees with leaves halfdressd
shade no soft songsters secret nest
whose springnotes soothe the pensive ear
but high the croaking cormorant flies
and mews and hawks with clamorous cries
tire the lone echoes of these caverns drear


perchance among the ruins grey
some widowd mourner loves to stray
marking the melancholy main
where once afar she could discern
oer the white waves his sail return
who never never now returns again


on these lone tombs by storms uptorn
the hopeless wretch may lingering mourn
till from the ocean rising red
the misty moon with lurid ray
lights her reluctant on her way
to steep in tears her solitary bed


hence the dire spirit oft surveys
the ship that to the western bays
with favouring gales pursues its course
then calls the vapour dark that blinds
the pilotcalls the felon winds
that heave the billows with resistless force


commixing with the blotted skies
high and more high the wild waves rise
till as impetuous torrents urge
driven on yon fatal bank accursed
the vessels massy timbers burst
and the crew sinks beneath the infuriate surge


there find the weak an early grave
while youthful strength the whelming wave
repels and labouring for the land
with shortend breath and upturnd eyes
sees the rough shore above him rise
nor dreams that rapine meets him on the strand


and are there then in human form
monsters more savage than the storm
who from the gasping sufferer tear
the dripping weedwho dare to reap
the inhuman harvest of the deep
from halfdrownd victims whom the tempests spare


ah yes by avarice once possessd
no pity moves the rustic breast
callous he provesas those who haply wait
till i a pilgrim weary worn
to my own native land return
with legal toils to drag me to my fate


as in the woods where leathery lichen weaves
its wintry web among the sallow leaves
which through cold months in whirling eddies blown
decay beneath the branches once their own
from the brown shelter of their foliage sear
spring the young blooms that lead the floral year


when waked by vernal suns the pilewort dares
expand her spotted leaves and shining stars
and veins empurpling all her tassels pale
bends the soft windflower in the tepid gale
uncultured bells of azure jacynths blow
and the breezescenting violet lurks below


so views the wanderer with delighted eyes
reviving hopes from black despondence rise
when blighted by adversitys chill breath
those hopes had felt a temporary death


then with gay heart he looks to future hours
when love shall dress for him the summer bowers
and as delicious dreams enchant his mind
forgets his sorrows past or gives them to the wind


ah say the fair louisa cried
say where the abode of love is found
pervading nature i replied
his influence spreads the world around
when mornings arrowy beams arise
he sparkles in the enlivening ray
and blushes in the glowing skies
when rosy evening fades away


the summer winds that gently blow
the flocks that bleat along the glades
the nightingale that soft and low
with music fills the listening shades
the murmurs of the silver surf
all echo loves enchanting notes
from violets lurking in the turf
his balmy breath through ether floats


from perfumed flowers and dewy leaves
delicious scents he bids exhale
he smiles amid autumnal sheaves
and clothes with green the grassy vale
but when that throne the god assumes
where his most powerful influence lies
tis on louisas cheek he blooms
and lightens from her radiant eyes


where thy broad branches brave the bitter north
like rugged indigent unheeded worth
lo vegetations guardian hands emboss
each giant limb with fronds of studded moss
that clothes the bark in many a fringed fold
begemmd with scarlet shields and cups of gold
which to the wildest winds their webs oppose
and mock the arrowy sleet or weltering snows


but to the warmer west the woodbine fair
with tassels that perfumed the summer air
the mantling clematis whose feathery bowers
waved in festoons with nightshades purple flowers
the silver weed whose corded fillets wove
round thy pale rind even as deceitful love
of mercenary beauty would engage
the dotard fondness of decrepit age
all these that during summers halcyon days
with their green canopies conceald thy sprays
are gone for ever or disfigured trail
their sallow relicts in the autumnal gale
or oer thy roots in faded fragments tossd
but tell of happier hours and sweetness lost


thus in fates trying hour when furious storms
strip social life of pleasures fragile forms
and awful justice as his rightful prey
tears luxurys silk and jeweld robe away
while reads adversity her lesson stern
and fortunes minions tremble as they learn
the crowds around her gilded car that hung
bent the lithe knee and trould the honeyd tongue


desponding fall or fly in pale despair
and scorn alone remembers that they were
not so integrity unchanged he lives
in the rude armour conscious honour gives
and dares with hardy front the troubled sky
in honestys uninjured panoply
neer on prosperitys enfeebling bed
or rosy pillows he reposed his head
but given to useful arts his ardent mind
has sought the general welfare of mankind
to mitigate their ills his greatest bliss
while studying them has taught him what he is
he when the human tempest rages worst
and the earth shudders as the thunders burst
firm as thy northern branch is rooted fast
and if he cant avert endures the blast


the trees have now hid at the edge of the hurst
the spot where the ruins decay
of the cottage where will of the woodland was nursed
and lived so beloved till the moment accursed
when he went from the woodland away


among all the lads of the plough or the fold
best esteemd by the sober and good
was will of the woodlands and often the old
would tell of his frolics for active and bold
was william the boy of the wood


yet gentle was he as the breath of the may
and when sick and declining was laid
the woodman his father young william away
would go to the forest to labour all day
and perform his hard task in his stead


and when his poor father the forester died
and his mother was sad and alone
he toild from the dawn and at evening he hied
in storm or in snow or whateer might betide
to supply all her wants from the town


one neighbour they had on the heath to the west
and no other the cottage was near
but she would send phoebe the child she loved best
to stay with the widow thus sad and distressd
her hours of dejection to cheer


as the buds of wild roses the cheeks of the maid
were just tinted with youths lovely hue
her form like the aspen wild graces displayd
and the eyes over which her luxuriant locks strayd
as the skies of the summer were blue


still labouring to live yet reflecting the while
young william considerd his lot
twas hard yet twas honest and one tender smile
from phoebe at night overpaid evry toil
and then all his fatigues were forgot


by the brook where it glides through the copse of arbeal
when to eat his cold fare he reclined
then soft from her home his sweet phoebe would steal
and bring him woodstrawberries to finish his meal
and would sit by his side while he dined


and though when employed in the deep forest glade
his days have seemd slowly to move
yet phoebe going home through the woodwalk has strayd
to bid him good nightand whatever she said
was more sweet than the voice of the dove


fair hope that the lover so fondly believes
then repeated each soulsoothing speech
and touchd with illusion that often deceives
the future with light as the sun through the leaves
illumines the boughs of the beech


but once more the tempests of chill winter blow
to depress and disfigure the earth
and now ere the dawn the young woodman must go
to his work in the forest half buried in snow
and at night bring home wood for the hearth


the bridge on the heath by the flood was washd down
and fast fell the sleet and the rain
the stream to a wild rapid river was grown
and long might the widow sit sighing alone
ere sweet phoebe could see her again


at the town was a marketand now for supplies
such as needed her humble abode
young william went forth and his mother with sighs
watchd long at the window with tears in her eyes
till he turnd through the fields to the road


then darkness came on and she heard with affright
the wind every moment more high
she lookd from the door not a star lent its light
but the tempest redoubled the gloom of the night
and the rain pourd in sheets from the sky


the clock in her cottage now mournfully told
the hours that went heavily on
twas midnight her spirits sank hopeless and cold
and it seemd as each blast of wind fearfully told
that long long would her william be gone


then heartsick and cold to her sad bed she crept
yet first made up the fire in the room
to guide his dark steps but she listend and wept
or if for a moment forgetful she slept
soon she startedand thought he was come


twas morn and the wind with a hoarse sullen moan
now seemd dying away in the wood
when the poor wretched mother still drooping alone
beheld on the threshold a figure unknown
in gorgeous apparel who stood


your son is a soldier abruptly cried he
and a place in our corps has obtaind
nay be not cast down you perhaps may soon see
your william a captain he now sends by me
the purse he already has gaind


so william entrappd twixt persuasion and force
is embarkd for the isles of the west
but he seemd to begin with ill omens his course
and felt recollection regret and remorse
continually weigh on his breast


with useless repentance he eagerly eyed
the high coast as it faded from view
and saw the green hills on whose northernmost side
was his own silvan home and he falterd and cried
adieu ah for ever adieu


who now my poor mother thy life shall sustain
since thy son has thus left thee forlorn
ah canst thou forgive me and not in the pain
of this cruel desertion of william complain
and lament that he ever was born


sweet phoebeif ever thy lover was dear
now forsake not the cottage of woe
but comfort my mother and quiet her fear
and help her to dry up the vain fruitless tear
that too long for my absence will flow


yet what if my phoebe another should wed
and lament her lost william no more
the thought was too cruel and anguish now sped
the dart of diseasewith the brave numerous dead
he has falln on the plaguetainted shore


in the lone village churchyard the chancelwall near
high grass now waves over the spot
where the mother of william unable to bear
his loss who to her widowd heart was so dear
has both him and her sorrows forgot


by the brook where it winds through the wood of arbeal
or amid the deep forest to moan
the poor wandering phoebe will silently steal
the pain of her bosom no reason can heal
and she loves to indulge it alone


her senses are injured her eyes dim with tears
she sits by the river and weaves
reed garlands against her dear william appears
then breathlessly listens and fancies she hears
his step in the half witherd leaves


ah such are the miseries to which ye give birth
ye statesmen neer dreading a scar
who from pictured saloon or the bright sculptured hearth
disperse desolation and death through the earth
when ye let loose the demons of war


not for the promise of the labourd field
not for the good the yellow harvests yield
i bend at ceres shrine
for dull to human eyes appear
the golden glories of the year
alasa melancholy worships mine


i hail the goddess for her scarlet flower
thou brilliant weed
that dost so far exceed
the richest gifts gay flora can bestow
heedless i passd thee in lifes morning hour
thou comforter of woe
till sorrow taught me to confess thy power


in early days when fancy cheats
a varied wreath i wove
of laughing springs luxuriant sweets
to deck ungrateful love
the rose or thorn my labours crownd
as venus smiled or venus frownd


but love and joy and all their train are flown
een languid hope no more is mine
and i will sing of thee alone
unless perchance the attributes of grief
the cypress bud and willow leaf
their pale funereal foliage blend with thine


hail lovely blossomthou canst ease
the wretched victims of disease
canst close those weary eyes in gentle sleep
which never open but to weep
for oh thy potent charm
can agonizing pain disarm
expel imperious memory from her seat
and bid the throbbing heart forget to beat


soulsoothing plant that can such blessings give
by thee the mourner bears to live
by thee the hopeless die
oh ever friendly to despair
might sorrows pallid votary dare
without a crime that remedy implore
which bids the spirit from its bondage fly
id court thy palliative aid no more


no more id sue that thou shouldst spread
thy spell around my aching head
but would conjure thee to impart
thy balsam for a broken heart
and by thy soft lethean power
inestimable flower
burst these terrestrial bonds and other regions try


sweet age of blessd delusion blooming boys
ah revel long in childhoods thoughtless joys
with light and pliant spirits that can stoop
to follow sportively the rolling hoop


to watch the sleeping top with gay delight
or mark with raptured gaze the sailing kite
or eagerly pursuing pleasures call
can find it centerd in the bounding ball
alas the day will come when sports like these
must lose their magic and their power to please
too swiftly fled the rosy hours of youth
shall yield their fairy charms to mournful truth


even now a mothers fond prophetic fear
sees the dark train of human ills appear
views various fortune for each lovely child
storms for the bold and anguish for the mild
beholds already those expressive eyes
beam a sad certainty of future sighs


and dreads each suffering those dear breasts may know
in their long passage through a world of woe
perchance predestined every pang to prove
that treacherous friends inflict or faithless love
for ah how few have found existence sweet
where grief is sure but happiness deceit


like a poor ghost the night i seek
its hollow winds repeat my sighs
the cold dews mingle on my cheek
with tears that wander from mine eyes


the thorns that still my couch molest
have robbd these heavy eyes of sleep
but though deprived of tranquil rest
i here at last am free to weep


twelve times the moon that rises red
oer yon tall wood of shadowy pine
has filld her orb since low was laid
my harriet that sweet form of thine


while each sad month as slow it passd
brought some new sorrow to deplore
some grief more poignant than the last
but thou canst calm those griefs no more


no more thy friendship soothes to rest
this wearied spirit tempesttossd
the cares that weigh upon my breast
are doubly felt since thou art lost


bright visions of ideal grace
that the young poets dreams inflame
were not more lovely than thy face
were not more perfect than thy frame


wit that no sufferings could impair
was thine and thine those mental powers
of force to chase the fiends that tear
from fancys hands her budding flowers


oer what my angel friend thou wert
dejected memory loves to mourn
regretting still that tender heart
now withering in a distant urn


but ere that wood of shadowy pine
twelve times shall yon full orb behold
this sickening heart that bleeds for thine
my harrietmay like thine be cold


green oer the copses springs soft hues are spreading
high wave the reeds in the transparent floods
the oak its sear and sallow foliage shedding
from their mossd cradles start its infant buds


pale as the tranquil tide of summers ocean
the willow now its slender leaf unveils
and through the sky with swiftly fleeting motion
drivn by the wind the rack of april sails


then as the gust declines the stealing showers
fall fresh and noiseless while at closing day
the low sun gleams on moist and halfblown flowers
that promise garlands for approaching may


blessd are yon peasant children simply singing
who through the newsprung grass rejoicing rove
more blessd to whom the time fond thought is bringing
of friends expected or returning love


the pensive wanderer blessd to whom reflection
points out some future views that soothe his mind
me how unlikewhom cruel recollection
but tells of comfort i shall never find


hope that on natures youth is still attending
no more to me her syren song shall sing
never to me her influence extending
shall i again enjoy the days of spring


yet how i loved them once these scenes remind me
when light of heart in childhoods thoughtless mirth
i reckd not that the cruel lot assignd me
should make me curse the hour that gave me birth


then from thy wildwood banks aruna roving
thy thymy downs with sportive steps i sought
and natures charms with artless transport loving
sung like the birds unheeded and untaught


but now the springtides pleasant hours returning
serve to awaken me to sharper pain
recalling scenes of agony and mourning
of baffled hope and prayers preferrd in vain


thus shone the sun his vernal rays displaying
thus did the woods in early verdure wave
while dire disease on all i loved was preying
and flowers seemd rising but to strew her grave


now mid reviving blooms i coldly languish
spring seems devoid of joy to me alone
each sound of pleasure aggravates my anguish
and speaks of beauty youth and sweetness gone


yet as stern duty bids with faint endeavour
i drag on life contending with my woe
though conscious misery still repeats that never
my soul one pleasurable hour shall know


lost in the tomb when hope no more appeases
the festerd wounds that prompt the eternal sigh
grief the most fatal of the hearts diseases
soon teaches whom it fastens on to die


the wretch undone for pain alone existing
the abject dread of death shall sure subdue
and far from his decisive hand resisting
rejoice to bid a world like this adieu


friend of the wretched wherefore should the eye
of blank despair whence tears have ceased to flow
be turnd from theeah wherefore fears to die
he who compelld each poignant grief to know
drains to its lowest dregs the cup of woe


would cowardice postpone thy calm embrace
to linger out long years in torturing pain
or not prefer thee to the ills that chase
him who too much impoverishd to obtain
from british themis right implores her aid in vain


sharp goading indigence who would not fly
that urges toil the exhausted strength above
or shun the once fond friends averted eye
or who to thy asylum not remove
to lose the wasting anguish of ungrateful love


can then the wounded wretch who must deplore
what most she loved to thy cold arms consignd
who hears the voice that soothed her soul no more
fear thee o deathor hug the chains that bind
to joyless cheerless life her sick reluctant mind


oh miserys cure who eer in pale dismay
has watchd the angel form they could not save
and seen their dearest blessing torn away
may well the terrors of thy triumph brave
nor pause in fearful dread before the opening grave


in youth from rock to rock i went
from hill to hill in discontent
of pleasure high and turbulent
most pleasd when most uneasy
but now my own delights i make
my thirst at every rill can slake
and gladly natures love partake
of thee sweet daisy


when soothed a while by milder airs
thee winter in the garland wears
that thinly shades his few grey hairs
spring cannot shun thee
whole summer fields are thine by right
and autumn melancholy wight
doth in thy crimson head delight
when rains are on thee


in shoals and bands a morrice train
thou greetst the traveller in the lane
if welcome once thou countst it gain
thou art not daunted
nor carst if thou be set at naught
and oft alone in nooks remote
we meet thee like a pleasant thought
when such are wanted


be violets in their secret mews
the flowers the wanton zephyrs chuse
proud be the rose with rains and dews
her head impearling
thou livst with less ambitious aim
yet hast not gone without thy fame
thou art indeed by many a claim
the poets darling


if to a rock from rains he fly
or some bright day of april sky
imprisond by hot sunshine lie
near the green holly
and wearily at length should fare
he need but look about and there
thou art a friend at hand to scare
his melancholy


a hundred times by rock or bower
ere thus i have lain couchd an hour
have i derived from thy sweet power
some apprehension
some steady love some brief delight
some memory that had taken flight
some chime of fancy wrong or right
or stray invention


if stately passions in me burn
and one chance look to thee should turn
i drink out of an humbler urn
a lowlier pleasure
the homely sympathy that heeds
the common life our nature breeds
a wisdom fitted to the needs
of hearts at leisure


when smitten by the morning ray
i see thee rise alert and gay
then chearful flower my spirits play
with kindred motion
at dusk ive seldom markd thee press
the ground as if in thankfulness
without some feeling more or less
of true devotion


and all day long i number yet
all seasons through another debt
which i wherever thou art met
to thee am owing
an instinct call it a blind sense
a happy genial influence
coming one knows not how nor whence
nor whither going


child of the year that round dost run
thy course bold lover of the sun
and chearful when the days begun
as morning leveret
thou long the poets praise shalt gain
thou wilt be more belovd by men
in times to come thou not in vain
art natures favorite


i met louisa in the shade
and having seen that lovely maid
why should i fear to say
that she is ruddy fleet and strong
and down the rocks can leap along
like rivulets in may


and she hath smiles to earth unknown
smiles that with motion of their own
do spread and sink and rise
that come and go with endless play
and ever as they pass away
are hidden in her eyes


she loves her fire her cottagehome
yet oer the moorland will she roam
in weather rough and bleak
and when against the wind she strains
oh might i kiss the mountain rains
that sparkle on her cheek


take all thats mine beneath the moon
if i with her but half a noon
may sit beneath the walls
of some old cave or mossy nook
when up she winds along the brook
to hunt the waterfalls


a barking sound the shepherd hears
a cry as of a dog or fox
he halts and searches with his eyes
among the scatterd rocks
and now at distance can discern
a stirring in a brake of fern
from which immediately leaps out
a dog and yelping runs about


the dog is not of mountain breed
its motions too are wild and shy
with something as the shepherd thinks
unusual in its cry
nor is there any one in sight
all round in hollow or on height
nor shout nor whistle strikes his ear
what is the creature doing here


it was a cove a huge recess
that keeps till june decembers snow
a lofty precipice in front
a silent tarn a below
far in the bosom of helvellyn
remote from public road or dwelling
pathway or cultivated land
from trace of human foot or hand


there sometimes does a leaping fish
send through the tarn a lonely chear
the crags repeat the ravens croak
in symphony austere
thither the rainbow comes the cloud
and mists that spread the flying shroud
and sunbeams and the sounding blast
that if it could would hurry past
but that enormous barrier binds it fast


not knowing what to think a while
the shepherd stood then makes his way
towards the dog oer rocks and stones
as quickly as he may
nor far had gone before he found
a human skeleton on the ground
sad sight the shepherd with a sigh
looks round to learn the history


from those abrupt and perilous rocks
the man had fallen that place of fear
at length upon the shepherds mind
it breaks and all is clear
he instantly recalld the name
and who he was and whence he came
rememberd too the very day
on which the traveller passd this way


but hear a wonder now for sake
of which this mournful tale i tell
a lasting monument of words
this wonder merits well
the dog which still was hovering nigh
repeating the same timid cry
this dog had been through three months space
a dweller in that savage place


yes proof was plain that since the day
on which the traveller thus had died
the dog had watchd about the spot
or by his masters side
how nourishd here through such long time
he knows who gave that love sublime
and gave that strength of feeling great
above all human estimate


she was a phantom of delight
when first she gleamd upon my sight
a lovely apparition sent
to be a moments ornament
her eyes as stars of twilight fair
like twilights too her dusky hair
but all things else about her drawn
from maytime and the chearful dawn
a dancing shape an image gay
to haunt to startle and waylay


i saw her upon nearer view
a spirit yet a woman too
her household motions light and free
and steps of virgin liberty
a countenance in which did meet
sweet records promises as sweet
a creature not too bright or good
for human natures daily food
for transient sorrows simple wiles
praise blame love kisses tears and smiles


and now i see with eye serene
the very pulse of the machine
a being breathing thoughtful breath
a traveller betwixt life and death
the reason firm the temperate will
endurance foresight strength and skill
a perfect woman nobly plannd
to warn to comfort and command
and yet a spirit still and bright
with something of an angel light


art thou the bird whom man loves best
the pious bird with the scarlet breast
our little english robin
the bird that comes about our doors
when autumn winds are sobbing
art thou the peter of norway boors
their thomas in finland
and russia far inland
the bird whom by some name or other
all men who know thee call their brother
the darling of children and men
could father adam open his eyes
and see this sight beneath the skies
hed wish to close them again


if the butterfly knew but his friend
hither his flight he would bend
and find his way to me
under the branches of the tree
in and out he darts about
his little heart is throbbing
can this be the bird to man so good
our consecrated robin
that after their bewildering
did cover with leaves the little childrenf
so painfully in the wood


what aild thee robin that thou couldst pursue
a beautiful creature
that is gentle by nature
beneath the summer sky
from flower to flower let him fly
tis all that he wishes to do


the chearer thou of our indoor sadness
he is the friend of our summer gladness
what hinders then that ye should be
playmates in the sunny weather
and fly about in the air together
like the hues of thy breast
his beautiful wings in crimson are drest
a brother he seems of thine own
if thou wouldst be happy in thy nest
o pious bird whom man loves best
love him or leave him alone


one morning raw it was and wet
a foggy day in winter time
a woman in the road i met
not old though something past her prime
majestic in her person tall and straight
and like a roman matrons was her mien and gait


the ancient spirit is not dead
old times thought i are breathing there
proud was i that my country bred
such strength a dignity so fair
she beggd an alms like one in poor estate
i lookd at her again nor did my pride abate


when from these lofty thoughts i woke
with the first word i had to spare
i said to her beneath your cloak
whats that which on your arm you bear
she answerd soon as she the question heard
a simple burthen sir a little singingbird


and thus continuing she said
i had a son who many a day
saild on the seas but he is dead
in denmark he was cast away
and i have been as far as hull to see
what clothes he might have left or other property


the bird and cage they both were his
twas my sons bird and neat and trim
he kept it many voyages
this singingbird hath gone with him
when last he saild he left the bird behind
as it might be perhaps from bodings of his mind


he to a fellowlodgers care
had left it to be watchd and fed
till he came back again and there
i found it when my son was dead
and now god help me for my little wit
i trail it with me sir he took so much delight in it


pansies lilies kingcups daisies
let them live upon their praises
long as theres a sun that sets
primroses will have their glory
long as there are violets
they will have a place in story
theres a flower that shall be mine
tis the little celandine


eyes of some men travel far
for the finding of a star
up and down the heavens they go
men that keep a mighty rout
im as great as they i trow
since the day i found thee out
little flowerill make a stir
like a great astronomer


modest yet withal an elf
bold and lavish of thyself
since we needs must first have met
i have seen thee high and low
thirty years or more and yet
twas a face i did not know
thou hast now go where i may
fifty greetings in a day


ere a leaf is on a bush
in the time before the thrush
has a thought about its nest
thou wilt come with half a call
spreading out thy glossy breast
like a careless prodigal
telling tales about the sun
when weve little warmth or none


poets vain men in their mood
travel with the multitude
never heed them i aver
that they all are wanton wooers
but the thrifty cottager
who stirs little out of doors
joys to spy thee near her home
spring is coming thou art come


comfort have thou of thy merit
kindly unassuming spirit
careless of thy neighbourhood
thou dost shew thy pleasant face
on the moor and in the wood
in the lanetheres not a place
howsoever mean it be
but tis good enough for thee


ill befal the yellow flowers
children of the flaring hours
buttercups that will be seen
whether we will see or no
others too of lofty mien
they have done as worldlings do
taken praise that should be thine
little humble celandine


prophet of delight and mirth
scornd and slighted upon earth
herald of a mighty band
of a joyous train ensuing
singing at my hearts command
in the lanes my thoughts pursuing
i will sing as doth behove
hymns in praise of what i love


pleasures newly found are sweet
when they lie about our feet
february last my heart
first at sight of thee was glad
all unheard of as thou art
thou must needs i think have had
celandine and long ago
praise of which i nothing know


i have not a doubt but he
whosoeer the man might be
who the first with pointed rays
workman worthy to be sainted
set the signboard in a blaze
when the risen sun he painted
took the fancy from a glance
at thy glittering countenance


soon as gentle breezes bring
news of winters vanishing
and the children build their bowers
sticking kerchiefplots of mold
all about with fullblown flowers
thick as sheep in shepherds fold
with the proudest thou art there
mantling in the tiny square


often have i sighd to measure
by myself a lonely pleasure
sighd to think i read a book
only read perhaps by me
yet i long could overlook
thy bright coronet and thee
and thy arch and wily ways
and thy store of other praise


blithe of heart from week to week
thou dost play at hideandseek
while the patient primrose sits
like a beggar in the cold
thou a flower of wiser wits
slippst into thy shelterd hold
bright as any of the train
when ye all are out again


thou art not beyond the moon
but a thing beneath our shoon
let as old magellen did
others roam about the sea
build who will a pyramid
praise it is enough for me
if there be but three or four
who will love my little flower


who is the happy warrior who is he
whom every man in arms should wish to be


it is the generous spirit who when brought
among the tasks of real life hath wrought
upon the plan that pleased his childish thought


whose high endeavours are an inward light
that make the path before him always bright
who with a natural instinct to discern
what knowledge can perform is diligent to learn
abides by this resolve and stops not there
but makes his moral being his prime care


who doomd to go in company with pain
and fear and bloodshed miserable train
turns his necessity to glorious gain


in face of these doth exercise a power
which is our humannatures highest dower
controls them and subdues transmutes bereaves
of their bad influence and their good receives
by objects which might force the soul to abate
her feeling renderd more compassionate
is placable because occasions rise
so often that demand such sacrifice
more skilful in selfknowledge even more pure
as tempted more more able to endure
as more exposd to suffering and distress
thence also more alive to tenderness
tis he whose law is reason who depends
upon that law as on the best of friends
whence in a state where men are tempted still
to evil for a guard against worse ill
and what in quality or act is best
doth seldom on a right foundation rest
he fixes good on good alone and owes
to virtue every triumph that he knows
who if he rise to station of command
rises by open means and there will stand
on honourable terms or else retire
and in himself possess his own desire
who comprehends his trust and to the same
keeps faithful with a singleness of aim
and therefore does not stoop nor lie in wait
for wealth or honors or for worldly state
whom they must follow on whose head must fall
like showers of manna if they come at all
whose powers shed round him in the common strife
or mild concerns of ordinary life
a constant influence a peculiar grace
but who if he be called upon to face
some awful moment to which heaven has joind
great issues good or bad for humankind
is happy as a lover and attired
with sudden brightness like a man inspired
and through the heat of conflict keeps the law
in calmness made and sees what he foresaw
or if an unexpected call succeed
come when it will is equal to the need
he who though thus endued as with a sense
and faculty for storm and turbulence
is yet a soul whose master bias leans
to homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes
sweet images which wheresoeer he be
are at his heart and such fidelity
it is his darling passion to approve
more brave for this that he hath much to love


tis finally the man who lifted high
conspicuous object in a nations eye
or left unthoughtof in obscurity


who with a toward or untoward lot
prosperous or adverse to his wish or not
plays in the many games of life that one
where what he most doth value must be won
whom neither shape of danger can dismay
nor thought of tender happiness betray


who not content that former worth stand fast
looks forward persevering to the last
from well to better daily selfsurpast


who whether praise of him must walk the earth
for ever and to noble deeds give birth
or he must go to dust without his fame
and leave a dead unprofitable name


finds comfort in himself and in his cause
and while the mortal mist is gathering draws
his breath in confidence of heavens applause


this is the happy warrior this is he
whom every man in arms should wish to be


when the brothers reachd the gateway
eustace pointed with his lance
to the horn which there was hanging
horn of the inheritance
horn it was which none could sound
no one upon living ground
save he who came as rightful heir
to egremonts domains and castle fair


heirs from ages without record
had the house of lucie born
who of right had claimd the lordship
by the proof upon the horn
each at the appointed hour
tried the horn it ownd his power
he was acknowledged and the blast
which good sir eustace sounded was the last


with his lance sir eustace pointed
and to hubert thus said he
what i speak this horn shall witness
for thy better memory
hear then and neglect me not
at this time and on this spot
the words are utterd from my heart
as my last earnest prayer ere we depart


on good service we are going
life to risk by sea and land
in which course if christ our saviour
do my sinful soul demand
hither come thou back straightway
hubert if alive that day
return and sound the horn that we
may have a living house still left in thee


fear not quickly answerd hubert
as i am thy fathers son
what thou askest noble brother
with gods favour shall be done
so were both right well content
from the castle forth they went
and at the head of their array
to palestine the brothers took their way


side by side they fought the lucies
were a line for valour famd
and whereer their strokes alighted
there the saracens were tamd
whence then could it come the thought
by what evil spirit brought
oh can a brave man wish to take
his brothers life for lands and castles sake


sir the ruffians said to hubert
deep he lies in jordan flood
stricken by this ill assurance
pale and trembling hubert stood
take your earningsoh that i
could have seen my brother die
it was a pang that vexd him then
and oft returned again and yet again


months passd on and no sir eustace
nor of him were tidings heard
wherefore bold as day the murderer
back again to england steerd
to his castle hubert sped
he has nothing now to dread
but silent and by stealth he came
and at an hour which nobody could name


none could tell if it were nighttime
night or day at even or morn
for the sound was heard by no one
of the proclamationhorn
but bold hubert lives in glee
months and years went smilingly
with plenty was his table spread
and bright the lady is who shares his bed


likewise he had sons and daughters
and as good men do he sate
at his board by these surrounded
flourishing in fair estate
and while thus in open day
once he sate as old books say
a blast was utterd from the horn
where by the castlegate it hung forlorn


tis the breath of good sir eustace
he is come to claim his right
ancient castle woods and mountains
hear the challenge with delight
hubert though the blast be blown
he is helpless and alone
thou hast a dungeon speak the word
and there he may be lodgd and thou be lord


speak astounded hubert cannot
and if power to speak he had
all are daunted all the household
smitten to the heart and sad
tis sir eustace if it be
living man it must be he
thus hubert thought in his dismay
and by a posterngate he slunk away


long and long was he unheard of
to his brother then he came
made confession askd forgiveness
askd it by a brothers name
and by all the saints in heaven
and of eustace was forgivn
then in a convent went to hide
his melancholy head and there he died


but sir eustace whom good angels
had preservd from murderers hands
and from pagan chains had rescued
livd with honour on his lands
sons he had saw sons of theirs
and through ages heirs of heirs
a long posterity renownd
sounded the horn which they alone could sound


where art thou my beloved son
where art thou worse to me than dead
oh find me prosperous or undone
or if the grave be now thy bed
why am i ignorant of the same
that i may rest and neither blame
nor sorrow may attend thy name


seven years alas to have received
no tidings of an only child
to have despaird and have believd
and be for evermore beguild
sometimes with thoughts of very bliss
i catch at them and then i miss
was ever darkness like to this


he was among the prime in worth
an object beauteous to behold
well born well bred i sent him forth
ingenuous innocent and bold
if things ensued that wanted grace
as hath been said they were not base
and never blush was on my face


ah little doth the young one dream
when full of play and childish cares
what power hath even his wildest scream
heard by his mother unawares
he knows it not he cannot guess
years to a mother bring distress
but do not make her love the less


neglect me no i sufferd long
from that ill thought and being blind
said pride shall help me in my wrong
kind mother have i been as kind
as ever breathed and that is true
ive wet my path with tears like dew
weeping for him when no one knew


my son if thou be humbled poor
hopeless of honour and of gain
oh do not dread thy mothers door
think not of me with grief and pain
i now can see with better eyes
and worldly grandeur i despise
and fortune with her gifts and lies


alas the fowls of heaven have wings
and blasts of heaven will aid their flight
they mount how short a voyage brings
the wanderers back to their delight
chains tie us down by land and sea
and wishes vain as mine may be
all that is left to comfort thee


perhaps some dungeon hears thee groan
maimd mangled by inhuman men
or thou upon a desart thrown
inheritest the lions den
or hast been summoned to the deep
thou thou and all thy mates to keep
an incommunicable sleep


i look for ghosts but none will force
their way to me tis falsely said
that there was ever intercourse
betwixt the living and the dead
for surely then i should have sight
of him i wait for day and night
with love and longings infinite


my apprehensions come in crowds
i dread the rustling of the grass
the very shadows of the clouds
have power to shake me as they pass
i question things and do not find
one that will answer to my mind
and all the world appears unkind


beyond participation lie
my troubles and beyond relief
if any chance to heave a sigh
they pity me and not my grief
then come to me my son or send
some tidings that my woes may end
i have no other earthly friend


that way look my infant lo
what a pretty baby show
see the kitten on the wall
sporting with the leaves that fall
witherd leaves one two and three
from the lofty eldertree
through the calm and frosty air
of this morning bright and fair
eddying round and round they sink
softly slowly one might think
from the motions that are made
every little leaf conveyd
sylph or faery hither tending
to this lower world descending
each invisible and mute
in his wavering parachute
but the kitten how she starts
crouches stretches paws and darts
first at one and then its fellow
just as light and just as yellow
there are many nownow one
now they stop and there are none
what intenseness of desire
in her upward eye of fire
with a tigerleap half way
now she meets the coming prey
lets it go as fast and then
has it in her power again
now she works with three or four
like an indian conjuror
quick as he in feats of art
far beyond in joy of heart
were her antics playd in the eye
of a thousand standersby
clapping hands with shout and stare
what would little tabby care
for the plaudits of the crowd
over happy to be proud
over wealthy in the treasure
of her own exceeding pleasure


tis a pretty babytreat
nor i deem for me unmeet
here for neither babe or me
other playmate can i see
of the countless living things
that with stir of feet and wings
in the sun or under shade
upon bough or grassy blade
and with busy revellings
chirp and song and murmurings
made this orchards narrow space
and this vale so blithe a place
multitudes are swept away
never more to breathe the day
some are sleeping some in bands
travelld into distant lands
others slunk to moor and wood
far from human neighbourhood
and among the kinds that keep
with us closer fellowship
with us openly abide
all have laid their mirth aside
where is he that giddy sprite
bluecap with his colours bright
who was blest as bird could be
feeding in the appletree
made such wanton spoil and rout
turning blossoms inside out


hung with head towards the ground
flutterd perchd into a round
bound himself and then unbound


lithest gaudiest harlequin
prettiest tumbler ever seen
light of heart and light of limb
what is now become of him
lambs that through the mountains went
frisking bleating merriment
when the year was in its prime
they are soberd by this time


if you look to vale or hill
if you listen all is still
save a little neighbouring rill


that from out the rocky ground
strikes a solitary sound
vainly glitters hill and plain
and the air is calm in vain
vainly morning spreads the lure
of a sky serene and pure
creature none can she decoy
into open sign of joy
is it that they have a fear
of the dreary season near
or that other pleasures be
sweeter even than gaiety


yet whateer enjoyments dwell
in the impenetrable cell
of the silent heart which nature
furnishes to every creature
whatsoeer we feel and know
too sedate for outward show
such a light of gladness breaks
pretty kitten from thy freaks
spreads with such a living grace
oer my little lauras face
yes the sight so stirs and charms
thee baby laughing in my arms
that almost i could repine
that your transports are not mine
that i do not wholly fare
even as ye do thoughtless pair
and i will have my careless season
spite of melancholy reason
will walk through life in such a way
that when time brings on decay
now and then i may possess
hours of perfect gladsomeness
pleasd by any random toy
by a kittens busy joy
or an infants laughing eye
sharing in the extacy
i would fare like that or this
find my wisdom in my bliss
keep the sprightly soul awake
and have faculties to take
even from things by sorrow wrought
matter for a jocund thought
spite of care and spite of grief
to gambol with lifes falling leaf


seven daughters had lord archibald
all children of one mother
i could not say in one short day
what love they bore each other
a garland of seven lilies wrought
seven sisters that together dwell
but he bold knight as ever fought
their father took of them no thought
he loved the wars so well
sing mournfully oh mournfully
the solitude of binnorie


fresh blows the wind a western wind
and from the shores of erin
across the wave a rover brave
to binnorie is steering
right onward to the scottish strand
the gallant ship is borne
the warriors leap upon the land
and hark the leader of the band
hath blown his bugle horn
sing mournfully oh mournfully
the solitude of binnorie


beside a grotto of their own
with boughs above them closing
the seven are laid and in the shade
they lie like fawns reposing
but now upstarting with affright
at noise of man and steed
away they fly to left to right
of your fair household father knight
methinks you take small heed
sing mournfully oh mournfully
the solitude of binnorie


away the seven fair campbells fly
and over hill and hollow
with menace proud and insult loud
the youthful rovers follow
cried they your father loves to roam
enough for him to find
the empty house when he comes home
for us your yellow ringlets comb
for us be fair and kind
sing mournfully oh mournfully
the solitude of binnorie


some close behind some side by side
like clouds in stormy weather
they run and cry nay let us die
and let us die together
a lake was near the shore was steep
there never foot had been
they ran and with a desperate leap
together plungd into the deep
nor ever more were seen
sing mournfully oh mournfully
the solitude of binnorie


the stream that flows out of the lake
as through the glen it rambles
repeats a moan oer moss and stone
for those seven lovely campbells
seven little islands green and bare
have risen from out the deep
the fishers say those sisters fair
by faeries are all buried there
and there together sleep
sing mournfully oh mournfully
the solitude of binnorie


o thou whose fancies from afar are brought
who of thy words dost make a mock apparel
and fittest to unutterable thought
the breezelike motion and the selfborn carol
thou faery voyager that dost float
in such clear water that thy boat
may rather seem
to brood on air than on an earthly stream
suspended in a stream as clear as sky
where earth and heaven do make one imagery
o blessed vision happy child
that art so exquisitely wild
i think of thee with many fears
for what may be thy lot in future years


i thought of times when pain might be thy guest
lord of thy house and hospitality
and grief uneasy lover never rest
but when she sate within the touch of thee


oh too industrious folly
oh vain and causeless melancholy
nature will either end thee quite
or lengthening out thy season of delight
preserve for thee by individual right
a young lambs heart among the fullgrown flocks
what hast thou to do with sorrow
or the injuries of tomorrow
thou art a dewdrop which the morn brings forth
not doomd to jostle with unkindly shocks
or to be traild along the soiling earth
a gem that glitters while it lives
and no forewarning gives
but at the touch of wrong without a strife
slips in a moment out of life


among all lovely things my love had been
had noted well the stars all flowers that grew
about her home but she had never seen
a glowworm never one and this i knew


while riding near her home one stormy night
a single glowworm did i chance to espy
i gave a fervent welcome to the sight
and from my horse i leapt great joy had i


upon a leaf the glowworm did i lay
to bear it with me through the stormy night
and as before it shone without dismay
albeit putting forth a fainter light


when to the dwelling of my love i came
i went into the orchard quietly
and left the glowworm blessing it by name
laid safely by itself beneath a tree


the whole next day i hoped and hoped with fear
at night the glowworm shone beneath the tree
i led my lucy to the spot look here
oh joy it was for her and joy for me


i travelld among unknown men
in lands beyond the sea
nor england did i know till then
what love i bore to thee


tis past that melancholy dream
nor will i quit thy shore
a second time for still i seem
to love thee more and more


among thy mountains did i feel
the joy of my desire
and she i cherishd turnd her wheel
beside an english fire


thy mornings shewdthy nights conceald
the bowers where lucy playd
and thine is too the last green field
which lucys eyes surveyd


stern daughter of the voice of god
o duty if that name thou love
who art a light to guide a rod
to check the erring and reprove
thou who art victory and law
when empty terrors overawe
from vain temptations dost set free
from strife and from despair a glorious ministry


there are who ask not if thine eye
be on them who in love and truth
where no misgiving is rely
upon the genial sense of youth
glad hearts without reproach or blot
who do thy work and know it not
may joy be theirs while life shall last
and thou if they should totter teach them to stand fast


serene will be our days and bright
and happy will our nature be
when love is an unerring light
and joy its own security
and blessd are they who in the main
this faith even now do entertain
live in the spirit of this creed
yet find that other strength according to their need


i loving freedom and untried
no sport of every random gust
yet being to myself a guide
too blindly have reposed my trust
resolved that nothing eer should press
upon my present happiness
i shoved unwelcome tasks away
but thee i now would serve more strictly if i may


through no disturbance of my soul
or strong compunction in me wrought
i supplicate for thy controul
but in the quietness of thought
me this uncharterd freedom tires
i feel the weight of chance desires
my hopes no more must change their name
i long for a repose which ever is the same


yet not the less would i throughout
still act according to the voice
of my own wish and feel past doubt
that my submissiveness was choice
not seeking in the school of pride
for precepts over dignified
denial and restraint i prize
no farther than they breed a second will more wise


stern lawgiver yet thou dost wear
the godheads most benignant grace
nor know we any thing so fair
as is the smile upon thy face
flowers laugh before thee on their beds
and fragrance in thy footing treads
thou dost preserve the stars from wrong
and the most ancient heavens through thee are fresh and strong


to humbler functions awful power
i call thee i myself commend
unto thy guidance from this hour
oh let my weakness have an end
give unto me made lowly wise
the spirit of selfsacrifice
the confidence of reason give
and in the light of truth thy bondman let me live


she had a tall mans height or more
no bonnet screend her from the heat
a long drabcolourd cloak she wore
a mantle reaching to her feet
what other dress she had i could not know
only she wore a cap that was as white as snow


in all my walks through field or town
such figure had i never seen
her face was of egyptian brown
fit person was she for a queen
to head those ancient amazonian files
or ruling bandits wife among the grecian isles


before me begging did she stand
pouring out sorrows like a sea
grief after griefon english land
such woes i knew could never be
and yet a boon i gave her for the creature
was beautiful to see a weed of glorious feature


i left her and pursued my way
and soon before me did espy
a pair of little boys at play
chasing a crimson butterfly
the taller followd with his hat in hand
wreathd round with yellow flowrs the gayest of the land


the other wore a rimless crown
with leaves of laurel stuck about
and they both followd up and down
each whooping with a merry shout
two brothers seemd they eight and ten years old
and like that womans face as gold is like to gold


they bolted on me thus and lo
each ready with a plaintive whine
said i not half an hour ago
your mother has had alms of mine
that cannot be one answerd she is dead
nay but i gave her pence and she will buy you bread


she has been dead sir many a day
sweet boys youre telling me a lie
it was your mother as i say
and in the twinkling of an eye
come come cried one and without more ado
off to some other play they both together flew


up with me up with me into the clouds
for thy song lark is strong
up with me up with me into the clouds
singing singing
with all the heavns about thee ringing
lift me guide me till i find
that spot which seems so to thy mind


i have walked through wildernesses dreary
and today my heart is weary
had i now the wings of a faery
up to thee would i fly
there is madness about thee and joy divine
in that song of thine
lift me guide me high and high
to thy banquetingplace in the sky


joyous as morning
thou art laughing and scorning
thou hast a nest for thy love and thy rest
and though little troubled with sloth
drunken lark thou wouldst be loth
to be such a traveller as i
happy happy liver
with a soul as strong as a mountain river
pouring out praise to the almighty giver
joy and jollity be with us both


alas my journey rugged and uneven
through prickly moors or dusty ways must wind
but hearing thee or others of thy kind
as full of gladness and as free of heaven
i with my fate contented will plod on
and hope for higher raptures when lifes day is done


with how sad steps o moon thou climbst the sky
how silently and with how wan a face
where art thou thou whom i have seen on high
running among the clouds a woodnymphs race
unhappy nuns whose common breaths a sigh
which they would stifle move at such a pace
the northern wind to call thee to the chace
must blow tonight his bugle horn had i
the power of merlin goddess this should be
and all the stars now shrouded up in heaven
should sally forth to keep thee company
what strife would then be yours fair creatures drivn
now up now down and sparkling in your glee
but cynthia should to thee the palm be givn
queen both for beauty and for majesty


the postboy drove with fierce career
for threatning clouds the moon had drownd
when suddenly i seemd to hear
a moan a lamentable sound


as if the wind blew many ways
i heard the sound and more and more
it seemd to follow with the chaise
and still i heard it as before


at length i to the boy calld out
he stoppd his horses at the word
but neither cry nor voice nor shout
nor aught else like it could be heard


the boy then smackd his whip and fast
the horses scamperd through the rain
and soon i heard upon the blast
the voice and bade him halt again


said i alighting on the ground
what can it be this piteous moan
and there a little girl i found
sitting behind the chaise alone


my cloak the word was last and first
and loud and bitterly she wept
as if her very heart would burst
and down from off the chaise she leapt


what ails you child she sobbd look here
i saw it in the wheel entangled
a weather beaten rag as eer
from any garden scarecrow dangled


twas twisted betwixt nave and spoke
her help she lent and with good heed
together we released the cloak
a wretched wretched rag indeed


and whither are you going child
to night along these lonesome ways
to durham answerd she half wild
then come with me into the chaise


she sate like one past all relief
sob after sob she forth did send
in wretchedness as if her grief
could never never have an end


my child in durham do you dwell
she checkd herself in her distress
and said my name is alice fell
im fatherless and motherless


and i to durham sir belong
and then as if the thought would choke
her very heart her grief grew strong
and all was for her tatterd cloak


the chaise drove on our journeys end
was nigh and sitting by my side
as if shed lost her only friend
she wept nor would be pacified


up to the taverndoor we post
of alice and her grief i told
and i gave money to the host
to buy a new cloak for the old


and let it be of duffil grey
as warm a cloak as man can sell
proud creature was she the next day
the little orphan alice fell


there was a roaring in the wind all night
the rain came heavily and fell in floods
but now the sun is rising calm and bright
the birds are singing in the distant woods
over his own sweet voice the stockdove broods
the jay makes answer as the magpie chatters
and all the air is filld with pleasant noise of waters


all things that love the sun are out of doors
the sky rejoices in the mornings birth
the grass is bright with raindrops on the moors
the hare is running races in her mirth
and with her feet she from the plashy earth
raises a mist which glittering in the sun
runs with her all the way wherever she doth run


i was a traveller then upon the moor
i saw the hare that racd about with joy
i heard the woods and distant waters roar
or heard them not as happy as a boy
the pleasant season did my heart employ
my old remembrances went from me wholly
and all the ways of men so vain and melancholy


but as it sometimes chanceth from the might
of joy in minds that can no farther go
as high as we have mounted in delight
in our dejection do we sink as low
to me that morning did it happen so
and fears and fancies thick upon me came
dim sadness blind thoughts i knew not nor could name


i heard the skylark singing in the sky
and i bethought me of the playful hare
even such a happy child of earth am i
even as these blissful creatures do i fare
far from the world i walk and from all care
but there may come another day to me
solitude pain of heart distress and poverty


my whole life i have livd in pleasant thought
as if lifes business were a summer mood
as if all needful things would come unsought
to genial faith still rich in genial good
but how can he expect that others should
build for him sow for him and at his call
love him who for himself will take no heed at all


i thought of chatterton the marvellous boy
the sleepless soul that perishd in its pride
of him who walkd in glory and in joy
behind his plough upon the mountainside
by our own spirits are we deified
we poets in our youth begin in gladness
but thereof comes in the end despondency and madness


now whether it were by peculiar grace
a leading from above a something given
yet it befel that in this lonely place
when up and down my fancy thus was driven
and i with these untoward thoughts had striven
i saw a man before me unawares
the oldest man he seemd that ever wore grey hairs


my course i stopped as soon as i espied
the old man in that naked wilderness
close by a pond upon the further side
he stood alone a minutes space i guess
i watchd him he continuing motionless
to the pools further margin then i drew
he being all the while before me full in view


as a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie
couchd on the bald top of an eminence
wonder to all who do the same espy
by what means it could thither come and whence
so that it seems a thing endued with sense
like a seabeast crawld forth which on a shelf
of rock or sand reposeth there to sun itself


such seemd this man not all alive nor dead
nor all asleep in his extreme old age
his body was bent double feet and head
coming together in their pilgrimage
as if some dire constraint of pain or rage
of sickness felt by him in times long past
a more than human weight upon his frame had cast


himself he proppd his body limbs and face
upon a long grey staff of shaven wood
and still as i drew near with gentle pace
beside the little pond or moorish flood
motionless as a cloud the old man stood
that heareth not the loud winds when they call
and moveth altogether if it move at all


at length himself unsettling he the pond
stirred with his staff and fixedly did look
upon the muddy water which he connd
as if he had been reading in a book
and now such freedom as i could i took
and drawing to his side to him did say
this morning gives us promise of a glorious day


a gentle answer did the old man make
in courteous speech which forth he slowly drew
and him with further words i thus bespake
what kind of work is that which you pursue
this is a lonesome place for one like you
he answerd me with pleasure and surprize
and there was while he spake a fire about his eyes


his words came feebly from a feeble chest
yet each in solemn order followd each
with something of a lofty utterance drest
choice word and measured phrase above the reach
of ordinary men a stately speech
such as grave livers do in scotland use
religious men who give to god and man their dues


he told me that he to this pond had come
to gather leeches being old and poor
employment hazardous and wearisome
and he had many hardships to endure
from pond to pond he roamd from moor to moor
housing with gods good help by choice or chance
and in this way he gaind an honest maintenance


the old man still stood talking by my side
but now his voice to me was like a stream
scarce heard nor word from word could i divide
and the whole body of the man did seem
like one whom i had met with in a dream
or like a man from some far region sent
to give me human strength and strong admonishment


my former thoughts returnd the fear that kills
the hope that is unwilling to be fed
cold pain and labour and all fleshly ills
and mighty poets in their misery dead
and now not knowing what the old man had said
my question eagerly did i renew
how is it that you live and what is it you do


he with a smile did then his words repeat
and said that gathering leeches far and wide
he travelled stirring thus about his feet
the waters of the ponds where they abide
once i could meet with them on every side
but they have dwindled long by slow decay
yet still i persevere and find them where i may


while he was talking thus the lonely place
the old mans shape and speech all troubled me
in my minds eye i seemd to see him pace
about the weary moors continually
wandering about alone and silently
while i these thoughts within myself pursued
he having made a pause the same discourse renewed


and soon with this he other matter blended
chearfully uttered with demeanour kind
but stately in the main and when he ended
i could have laughd myself to scorn to find
in that decrepit man so firm a mind
god said i be my help and stay secure
ill think of the leechgatherer on the lonely moor


nuns fret not at their convents narrow room
and hermits are contented with their cells
and students with their pensive citadels
maids at the wheel the weaver at his loom
sit blithe and happy bees that soar for bloom
high as the highest peak of furness fells
will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells
in truth the prison unto which we doom
ourselves no prison is and hence to me
in sundry moods twas pastime to be bound
within the sonnets scanty plot of ground
pleasd if some souls for such there needs must be
who have felt the weight of too much liberty
should find short solace there as i have found


how sweet it is when mother fancy rocks
the wayward brain to saunter through a wood
an old place full of many a lovely brood
tall trees green arbours and ground flowers in flocks
and wild rose tiptoe upon hawthorn stocks
like to a bonny lass who plays her pranks
at wakes and fairs with wandering mountebanks
when she stands cresting the clowns head and mocks
the crowd beneath her verily i think
such place to me is sometimes like a dream
or map of the whole world thoughts link by link
enter through ears and eyesight with such gleam
of all things that at last in fear i shrink
and leap at once from the delicious stream


where lies the land to which yon ship must go
festively she puts forth in trim array
as vigorous as a lark at break of day
is she for tropic suns or polar snow
what boots the enquiry neither friend nor foe
she cares for let her travel where she may
she finds familiar names a beaten way
ever before her and a wind to blow
yet still i ask what haven is her mark
and almost as it was when ships were rare
from time to time like pilgrims here and there
crossing the waters doubt and something dark
of the old sea some reverential fear
is with me at thy farewell joyous bark


ere we had reachd the wishdfor place night fell
we were too late at least by one dark hour
and nothing could we see of all that power
of prospect whereof many thousands tell
the western sky did recompence us well
with grecian temple minaret and bower
and in one part a minster with its tower
substantially distinct a place for bell
or clock to toll from many a glorious pile
did we behold sights that might well repay
all disappointment and as such the eye
delighted in them but we felt the while
we should forget them they are of the sky
and from our earthly memory fade away


these words were utterd in a pensive mood
even while mine eyes were on that solemn sight
a contrast and reproach to gross delight
and lifes unspiritual pleasures daily wood
but now upon this thought i cannot brood
it is unstable and deserts me quite
nor will i praise a cloud however bright
disparaging mans gifts and proper food
the grove the skybuilt temple and the dome
though clad in colours beautiful and pure
find in the heart of man no natural home
the immortal mind craves objects that endure
these cleave to it from these it cannot roam
nor they from it their fellowship is secure


o gentle sleep do they belong to thee
these twinklings of oblivion thou dost love
to sit in meekness like the brooding dove
a captive never wishing to be free
this tiresome night o sleep thou art to me
a fly that up and down himself doth shove
upon a fretful rivulet now above
now on the water vexd with mockery
i have no pain that calls for patience no
hence am i cross and peevish as a child
am pleasd by fits to have thee for my foe
yet ever willing to be reconciled
o gentle creature do not use me so
but once and deeply let me be beguiled


a flock of sheep that leisurely pass by
one after one the sound of rain and bees
murmuring the fall of rivers winds and seas
smooth fields white sheets of water and pure sky
ive thought of all by turns and still i lie
sleepless and soon the small birds melodies
must hear first utterd from my orchard trees
and the first cuckoos melancholy cry
even thus last night and two nights more i lay
and could not win thee sleep by any stealth
so do not let me wear to night away
without thee what is all the mornings wealth
come blessed barrier betwixt day and day
dear mother of fresh thoughts and joyous health


fond words have oft been spoken to thee sleep
and thou hast had thy store of tenderest names
the very sweetest words that fancy frames
when thankfulness of heart is strong and deep
dear bosom child we call thee that dost steep
in rich reward all suffering balm that tames
all anguish saint that evil thoughts and aims
takest away and into souls dost creep
like to a breeze from heaven shall i alone
i surely not a man ungently made
call thee worst tyrant by which flesh is crost
perverse selfwilld to own and to disown
mere slave of them who never for thee prayd
still last to come where thou art wanted most


with ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh
like stars in heaven and joyously it showed
some lying fast at anchor in the road
some veering up and down one knew not why
a goodly vessel did i then espy
come like a giant from a haven broad
and lustily along the bay she strode
her tackling rich and of apparel high
this ship was nought to me nor i to her
yet i pursued her with a lovers look
this ship to all the rest did i prefer
when will she turn and whither she will brook
no tarrying where she comes the winds must stir
on went she and due north her journey took


o mountain stream the shepherd and his cot
are privilegd inmates of deep solitude
nor would the nicest anchorite exclude
a field or two of brighter green or plot
of tillageground that seemeth like a spot
of stationary sunshine thou hast viewd
these only duddon with their paths renewd
by fits and starts yet this contents thee not
thee hath some awful spirit impelld to leave
utterly to desert the haunts of men
though simple thy companions were and few
and through this wilderness a passage cleave
attended but by thy own voice save when
the clouds and fowls of the air thy way pursue


yes hope may with my strong desire keep pace
and i be undeluded unbetrayd
for if of our affections none find grace
in sight of heaven then wherefore hath god made
the world which we inhabit better plea
love cannot have than that in loving thee
glory to that eternal peace is paid
who such divinity to thee imparts
as hallows and makes pure all gentle hearts
his hope is treacherous only whose love dies
with beauty which is varying every hour
but in chaste hearts uninfluenced by the power
of outward change there blooms a deathless flower
that breathes on earth the air of paradise


no mortal object did these eyes behold
when first they met the placid light of thine
and my soul felt her destiny divine
and hope of endless peace in me grew bold
heavnborn the soul a heavnward course must hold
beyond the visible world she soars to seek
for what delights the sense is false and weak
ideal form the universal mould
the wise man i affirm can find no rest
in that which perishes nor will he lend
his heart to aught which doth on time depend
tis sense unbridled will and not true love
which kills the soul love betters what is best
even here below but more in heaven above


the prayers i make will then be sweet indeed
if thou the spirit give by which i pray
my unassisted heart is barren clay
which of its native self can nothing feed
of good and pious works thou art the seed
which quickens only where thou sayst it may
unless thou shew to us thine own true way
no man can find it father thou must lead
do thou then breathe those thoughts into my mind
by which such virtue may in me be bred
that in thy holy footsteps i may tread
the fetters of my tongue do thou unbind
that i may have the power to sing of thee
and sound thy praises everlastingly


calm is all nature as a resting wheel
the kine are couchd upon the dewy grass
the horse alone seen dimly as i pass
is up and cropping yet his later meal
dark is the ground a slumber seems to steal
oer vale and mountain and the starless sky
now in this blank of things a harmony
homefelt and homecreated seems to heal
that grief for which the senses still supply
fresh food for only then when memory
is hushd am i at rest my friends restrain
those busy cares that would allay my pain
oh leave me to myself nor let me feel
the officious touch that makes me droop again


earth has not any thing to shew more fair
dull would he be of soul who could pass by
a sight so touching in its majesty
this city now doth like a garment wear
the beauty of the morning silent bare
ships towers domes theatres and temples lie
open unto the fields and to the sky
all bright and glittering in the smokeless air
never did sun more beautifully steep
in his first splendor valley rock or hill
neer saw i never felt a calm so deep
the river glideth at his own sweet will
dear god the very houses seem asleep
and all that mighty heart is lying still


beloved vale i said when i shall con
those many records of my childish years
remembrance of myself and of my peers
will press me down to think of what is gone
will be an awful thought if life have one
but when into the vale i came no fears
distressd me i lookd round i shed no tears
deep thought or awful vision i had none
by thousand petty fancies i was crossd
to see the trees which i had thought so tall
mere dwarfs the brooks so narrow fields so small
a jugglers balls old time about him tossd
i looked i stared i smiled i laughed and all
the weight of sadness was in wonder lost


methought i saw the footsteps of a throne
which mists and vapours from mine eyes did shroud
nor view of him who sate thereon allowd
but all the steps and ground about were strown
with sights the ruefullest that flesh and bone
ever put on a miserable crowd
sick hale old young who cried before that cloud
thou art our king o death to thee we groan
i seemd to mount those steps the vapours gave
smooth way and i beheld the face of one
sleeping alone within a mossy cave
with her face up to heaven that seemd to have
pleasing remembrance of a thought foregone
a lovely beauty in a summer grave


lady the songs of spring were in the grove
while i was framing beds for winter flowers
while i was planting green unfading bowers
and shrubs to hang upon the warm alcove
and sheltering wall and still as fancy wove
the dream to time and natures blended powers
i gave this paradise for winter hours
a labyrinth lady which your feet shall rove
yes when the sun of life more feebly shines
becoming thoughts i trust of solemn gloom
or of high gladness you shall hither bring
and these perennial bowers and murmuring pines
be gracious as the music and the bloom
and all the mighty ravishment of spring


the world is too much with us late and soon
getting and spending we lay waste our powers
little we see in nature that is ours
we have given our hearts away a sordid boon
this sea that bares her bosom to the moon
the winds that will be howling at all hours
and are upgathered now like sleeping flowers
for this for every thing we are out of tune
it moves us notgreat god id rather be
a pagan suckled in a creed outworn
so might i standing on this pleasant lea
have glimpses that would make me less forlorn
have sight of proteus coming from the sea
or hear old triton blow his wreathed horn


it is a beauteous evening calm and free
the holy time is quiet as a nun
breathless with adoration the broad sun
is sinking down in its tranquillity
the gentleness of heaven is on the sea
listen the mighty being is awake
and doth with his eternal motion make
a sound like thundereverlastingly
dear child dear girl that walkest with me here
if thou appearst untouchd by solemn thought
thy nature is not therefore less divine
thou liest in abrahams bosom all the year
and worshippst at the temples inner shrine
god being with thee when we know it not


calvert it must not be unheard by them
who may respect my name that i to thee
owd many years of early liberty
this care was thine when sickness did condemn
thy youth to hopeless wasting root and stem
that i if frugal and severe might stray
whereer i liked and finally array
my temples with the muses diadem
hence if in freedom i have lovd the truth
if there be aught of pure or good or great
in my past verse or shall be in the lays
of higher mood which now i meditate
it gladdens me o worthy shortlived youth
to think how much of this will be thy praise


fair star of evening splendor of the west
star of my country on the horizons brink
thou hangest stooping as might seem to sink
on englands bosom yet well pleasd to rest
meanwhile and be to her a glorious crest
conspicuous to the nations thou i think
shouldst be my countrys emblem and shouldst wink
bright star with laughter on her banners drest
in thy fresh beauty there that dusky spot
beneath thee it is england there it lies
blessings be on you both one hope one lot
one life one glory i with many a fear
for my dear country many heartfelt sighs
among men who do not love her linger here


is it a reed thats shaken by the wind
or what is it that ye go forth to see
lords lawyers statesmen squires of low degree
men known and men unknown sick lame and blind
post forward all like creatures of one kind
with firstfruit offerings crowd to bend the knee
in france before the newborn majesty
tis ever thus ye men of prostrate mind
a seemly reverence may be paid to power
but thats a loyal virtue never sown
in haste nor springing with a transient shower
when truth when sense when liberty were flown
what hardship had it been to wait an hour
shame on you feeble heads to slavery prone


jones when from calais southward you and i
travelld on foot together then this way
which i am pacing now was like the may
with festivals of newborn liberty
a homeless sound of joy was in the sky
the antiquated earth as one might say
beat like the heart of man songs garlands play
banners and happy faces far and nigh
and now sole register that these things were
two solitary greetings have i heard
_good morrow citizen_ a hollow word
as if a dead man spake it yet despair
i feel not happy am i as a bird
fair seasons yet will come and hopes as fair


i grievd for buonaparte with a vain
and an unthinking grief the vital blood
of that mans mind what can it be what food
fed his first hopes what knowledge could he gain
tis not in battles that from youth we train
the governor who must be wise and good
and temper with the sternness of the brain
thoughts motherly and meek as womanhood
wisdom doth live with children round her knees
books leisure perfect freedom and the talk
man holds with weekday man in the hourly walk
of the minds business these are the degrees
by which true sway doth mount this is the stalk
true power doth grow on and her rights are these


festivals have i seen that were not names
this is young buonapartes natal day
and his is henceforth an established sway
consul for life with worship france proclaims
her approbation and with pomps and games
heaven grant that other cities may be gay
calais is not and i have bent my way
to the seacoast noting that each man frames
his business as he likes another time
that was when i was here long years ago
the senselessness of joy was then sublime
happy is he who caring not for pope
consul or king can sound himself to know
the destiny of man and live in hope


once did she hold the gorgeous east in fee
and was the safeguard of the west the worth
of venice did not fall below her birth
venice the eldest child of liberty
she was a maiden city bright and free
no guile seduced no force could violate
and when she took unto herself a mate
she must espouse the everlasting sea
and what if she had seen those glories fade
those titles vanish and that strength decay
yet shall some tribute of regret be paid
when her long life hath reachd its final day
men are we and must grieve when even the shade
of that which once was great is passd away


the voice of song from distant lands shall call
to that great king shall hail the crowned youth
who taking counsel of unbending truth
by one example hath set forth to all
how they with dignity may stand or fall
if fall they must now whither doth it tend
and what to him and his shall be the end
that thought is one which neither can appal
nor chear him for the illustrious swede hath done
the thing which ought to be he stands _above_
all consequences work he hath begun
of fortitude and piety and love
which all his glorious ancestors approve
the heroes bless him him their rightful son


toussaint the most unhappy man of men
whether the rural milkmaid by her cow
sing in thy hearing or thou liest now
alone in some deep dungeons earless den
o miserable chieftain where and when
wilt thou find patience yet die not do thou
wear rather in thy bonds a chearful brow
though fallen thyself never to rise again
live and take comfort thou hast left behind
powers that will work for thee air earth and skies
theres not a breathing of the common wind
that will forget thee thou hast great allies
thy friends are exultations agonies
and love and mans unconquerable mind


we had a fellowpassenger who came
from calais with us gaudy in array
a negro woman like a lady gay
yet silent as a woman fearing blame
dejected meek yea pitiably tame
she sate from notice turning not away
but on our profferd kindness still did lay
a weight of languid speech or at the same
was silent motionless in eyes and face
she was a negro woman drivn from france
rejected like all others of that race
not one of whom may now find footing there
this the poor outcast did to us declare
nor murmurd at the unfeeling ordinance


dear fellow traveller here we are once more
the cock that crows the smoke that curls that sound
of bells those boys that in yon meadowground
in white sleevd shirts are playing by the score
and even this little rivers gentle roar
all all are english oft have i lookd round
with joy in kents green vales but never found
myself so satisfied in heart before
europe is yet in bonds but let that pass
thought for another moment thou art free
my country and tis joy enough and pride
for one hours perfect bliss to tread the grass
of england once again and hear and see
with such a dear companion at my side


inland within a hollow vale i stood
and saw while sea was calm and air was clear
the coast of france the coast of france how near
drawn almost into frightful neighbourhood
i shrunk for verily the barrier flood
was like a lake or river bright and fair
a span of waters yet what power is there
what mightiness for evil and for good
even so doth god protect us if we be
virtuous and wise winds blow and waters roll
strength to the brave and power and deity
yet in themselves are nothing one decree
spake laws to _them_ and said that by the soul
only the nations shall be great and free


two voices are there one is of the sea
one of the mountains each a mighty voice
in both from age to age thou didst rejoice
they were thy chosen music liberty
there came a tyrant and with holy glee
thou foughtst against him but hast vainly striven
thou from thy alpine holds at length art driven
where not a torrent murmurs heard by thee
of one deep bliss thine ear hath been bereft
then cleave o cleave to that which still is left
for highsould maid what sorrow would it be
that mountain floods should thunder as before
and ocean bellow from his rocky shore
and neither awful voice be heard by thee


o friend i know not which way i must look
for comfort being as i am opprest
to think that now our life is only drest
for shew mean handywork of craftsman cook
or groom we must run glittering like a brook
in the open sunshine or we are unblest
the wealthiest man among us is the best
no grandeur now in nature or in book
delights us rapine avarice expence
this is idolatry and these we adore
plain living and high thinking are no more
the homely beauty of the good old cause
is gone our peace our fearful innocence
and pure religion breathing household laws


milton thou shouldst be living at this hour
england hath need of thee she is a fen
of stagnant waters altar sword and pen
fireside the heroic wealth of hall and bower
have forfeited their ancient english dower
of inward happiness we are selfish men
oh raise us up return to us again
and give us manners virtue freedom power
thy soul was like a star and dwelt apart
thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea
pure as the naked heavens majestic free
so didst thou travel on lifes common way
in chearful godliness and yet thy heart
the lowliest duties on itself did lay


great men have been among us hands that pennd
and tongues that utterd wisdom better none
the later sydney marvel harrington
young vane and others who calld milton friend
these moralists could act and comprehend
they knew how genuine glory was put on
taught us how rightfully a nation shone
in splendor what strength was that would not bend
but in magnanimous meekness france tis strange
hath brought forth no such souls as we had then
perpetual emptiness unceasing change
no single volume paramount no code
no master spirit no determined road
but equally a want of books and men


it is not to be thought of that the flood
of british freedom which to the open sea
of the worlds praise from dark antiquity
hath flowed with pomp of waters unwithstood
road by which all might come and go that would
and bear out freights of worth to foreign lands
that this most famous stream in bogs and sands
should perish and to evil and to good
be lost for ever in our halls is hung
armoury of the invincible knights of old
we must be free or die who speak the tongue
that shakespeare spake the faith and morals hold
which milton held in every thing we are sprung
of earths first blood have titles manifold


when i have borne in memory what has tamed
great nations how ennobling thoughts depart
when men change swords for ledgers and desert
the students bower for gold some fears unnamed
i had my country am i to be blamed
but when i think of thee and what thou art
verily in the bottom of my heart
of those unfilial fears i am ashamed
but dearly must we prize thee we who find
in thee a bulwark of the cause of men
and i by my affection was beguiled
what wonder if a poet now and then
among the many movements of his mind
felt for thee as a lover or a child


one might believe that natural miseries
had blasted france and made of it a land
unfit for men and that in one great band
her sons were bursting forth to dwell at ease
but tis a chosen soil where sun and breeze
shed gentle favors rural works are there
and ordinary business without care
spot rich in all things that can soothe and please
how piteous then that there should be such dearth
of knowledge that whole myriads should unite
to work against themselves such fell despite
should come in phrenzy and in drunken mirth
impatient to put out the only light
of liberty that yet remains on earth


there is a bondage which is worse to bear
than his who breathes by roof and floor and wall
pent in a tyrants solitary thrall
tis his who walks about in the open air
one of a nation who henceforth must wear
their fetters in their souls for who could be
who even the best in such condition free
from selfreproach reproach which he must share
with human nature never be it ours
to see the sun how brightly it will shine
and know that noble feelings manly powers
instead of gathering strength must droop and pine
and earth with all her pleasant fruits and flowers
fade and participate in mans decline


these times touch moneyd worldlings with dismay
even rich men brave by nature taint the air
with words of apprehension and despair
while tens of thousands thinking on the affray
men unto whom sufficient for the day
and minds not stinted or untilld are given
sound healthy children of the god of heaven
are cheerful as the rising sun in may
what do we gather hence but firmer faith
that every gift of noble origin
is breathed upon by hopes perpetual breath
that virtue and the faculties within
are vital and that riches are akin
to fear to change to cowardice and death


england the time is come when thou shouldst wean
thy heart from its emasculating food
the truth should now be better understood
old things have been unsettled we have seen
fair seedtime better harvest might have been
but for thy trespasses and at this day
if for greece egypt india africa
aught good were destined thou wouldst step between
england all nations in this charge agree
but worse more ignorant in love and hate
far far more abject is thine enemy
therefore the wise pray for thee though the freight
of thy offences be a heavy weight
oh grief that earths best hopes rest all with thee


when looking on the present face of things
i see one man of men the meanest too
raisd up to sway the world to do undo
with mighty nations for his underlings
the great events with which old story rings
seem vain and hollow i find nothing great
nothing is left which i can venerate
so that almost a doubt within me springs
of providence such emptiness at length
seems at the heart of all things but great god
i measure back the steps which i have trod
and tremble seeing as i do the strength
of such poor instruments with thoughts sublime
i tremble at the sorrow of the time


vanguard of liberty ye men of kent
ye children of a soil that doth advance
its haughty brow against the coast of france
now is the time to prove your hardiment
to france be words of invitation sent
they from their fields can see the countenance
of your fierce war may ken the glittering lance
and hear you shouting forth your brave intent
left single in bold parley ye of yore
did from the norman win a gallant wreath
confirmd the charters that were yours before
no parleying now in britain is one breath
we all are with you now from shore to shore
ye men of kent tis victory or death


six thousand veterans practisd in wars game
tried men at killicranky were arrayd
against an equal host that wore the plaid
shepherds and herdsmenlike a whirlwind came
the highlanders the slaughter spread like flame
and garry thundering down his mountainroad
was stoppd and could not breathe beneath the load
of the dead bodies twas a day of shame
for them whom precept and the pedantry
of cold mechanic battle do enslave
oh for a single hour of that dundee
who on that day the word of onset gave
like conquest would the men of england see
and her foes find a like inglorious grave


shout for a mighty victory is won
on british ground the invaders are laid low
the breath of heaven has drifted them like snow
and left them lying in the silent sun
never to rise againthe work is done
come forth ye old men now in peaceful show
and greet your sons drums beat and trumpets blow
make merry wives ye little children stun
your grandames ears with pleasure of your noise
clap infants clap your hands divine must be
that triumph when the very worst the pain
and even the prospect of our brethren slain
hath something in it which the heart enjoys
in glory will they sleep and endless sanctity


another yearanother deadly blow
another mighty empire overthrown
and we are left or shall be left alone
the last that dares to struggle with the foe
tis well from this day forward we shall know
that in ourselves our safety must be sought
that by our own right hands it must be wrought
that we must stand unproppd or be laid low
o dastard whom such foretaste doth not cheer
we shall exult if they who rule the land
be men who hold its many blessings dear
wise upright valiant not a venal band
who are to judge of danger which they fear
and honour which they do not understand


by derwents side my fathers cottage stood
the woman thus her artless story told
one field a flock and what the neighbouring flood
supplied to him were more than mines of gold
light was my sleep my days in transport rolld
with thoughtless joy i stretchd along the shore
my fathers nets or watched when from the fold
high oer the cliffs i led my fleecy store
a dizzy depth below his boat and twinkling oar


my father was a good and pious man
an honest man by honest parents bred
and i believe that soon as i began
to lisp he made me kneel beside my bed
and in his hearing there my prayers i said
and afterwards by my good father taught
i read and loved the books in which i read
for books in every neighbouring house i sought
and nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought


can i forget what charms did once adorn
my garden stored with pease and mint and thyme
and rose and lilly for the sabbath morn
the sabbath bells and their delightful chime
the gambols and wild freaks at shearing time
my hens rich nest through long grass scarce espied
the cowslipgathering at mays dewy prime
the swans that when i sought the waterside
from far to meet me came spreading their snowy pride


the staff i yet remember which upbore
the bending body of my active sire
his seat beneath the honeyed sycamore
when the bees hummed and chair by winter fire
when marketmorning came the neat attire
with which though bent on haste myself i deckd
my watchful dog whose starts of furious ire
when stranger passed so often i have checkd
the redbreast known for years which at my casement peckd


the suns of twenty summers danced along
ah little marked how fast they rolled away
then rose a mansion proud our woods among
and cottage after cottage owned its sway
no joy to see a neighbouring house or stray
through pastures not his own the master took
my father dared his greedy wish gainsay
he loved his old hereditary nook
and ill could i the thought of such sad parting brook


but when he had refused the proffered gold
to cruel injuries he became a prey
sore traversed in whateer he bought and sold
his troubles grew upon him day by day
till all his substance fell into decay
his little range of water was denied
all but the bed where his old body lay
all all was seized and weeping side by side
we sought a home where we uninjured might abide


can i forget that miserable hour
when from the last hilltop my sire surveyed
peering above the trees the steeple tower
that on his marriageday sweet music made
till then he hoped his bones might there be laid
close by my mother in their native bowers
bidding me trust in god he stood and prayed
i could not praythrough tears that fell in showers
glimmerd our dearloved home alas no longer ours


there was a youth whom i had loved so long
that when i loved him not i cannot say
mid the green mountains many and many a song
we two had sung like little birds in may
when we began to tire of childish play
we seemed still more and more to prize each other
we talked of marriage and our marriage day
and i in truth did love him like a brother
for never could i hope to meet with such another


his father said that to a distant town
he must repair to ply the artists trade
what tears of bitter grief till then unknown
what tender vows our last sad kiss delayed
to him we turnedwe had no other aid
like one revived upon his neck i wept
and her whom he had loved in joy he said
he well could love in grief his faith he kept
and in a quiet home once more my father slept


four years each day with daily bread was blest
by constant toil and constant prayer supplied
three lovely infants lay upon my breast
and often viewing their sweet smiles i sighed
and knew not why my happy father died
when sad distress reduced the childrens meal
thrice happy that from him the grave did hide
the empty loom cold hearth and silent wheel
and tears that flowed for ills which patience could not heal


twas a hard change an evil time was come
we had no hope and no relief could gain
but soon with proud parade the noisy drum
beat round to sweep the streets of want and pain
my husbands arms now only served to strain
me and his children hungering in his view
in such dismay my prayers and tears were vain
to join those miserable men he flew
and now to the seacoast with numbers more we drew


there foul neglect for months and months we bore
nor yet the crowded fleet its anchor stirred
green fields before us and our native shore
by fever from polluted air incurred
ravage was made for which no knell was heard
fondly we wished and wished away nor knew
mid that long sickness and those hopes deferrd
that happier days we never more must view
the parting signal streamed at last the land withdrew


but from delay the summer calms were past
on as we drove the equinoctial deep
ran mountainshigh before the howling blaft
we gazed with terror on the gloomy sleep
of them that perished in the whirlwinds sweep
untaught that soon such anguish must ensue
our hopes such harvest of affliction reap
that we the mercy of the waves should rue
we reached the western world a poor devoted crew


oh dreadful price of being to resign
all that is dear _in_ being better far
in wants most lonely cave till death to pine
unseen unheard unwatched by any star
or in the streets and walks where proud men are
better our dying bodies to obtrude
than doglike wading at the heels of war
protract a curst existence with the brood
that lap their very nourishment their brothers blood


the pains and plagues that on our heads came down
disease and famine agony and fear
in wood or wilderness in camp or town
it would thy brain unsettle even to hear
all perishedall in one remorseless year
husband and children one by one by sword
and ravenous plague all perished every tear
dried up despairing desolate on board
a british ship i waked as from a trance restored


peaceful as some immeasurable plain
by the first beams of dawning light impressd
in the calm sunshine slept the glittering main
the very ocean has its hour of rest
that comes not to the human mourners breast
remote from man and storms of mortal care
a heavenly silence did the waves invest
i looked and looked along the silent air
until it seemed to bring a joy to my despair


ah how unlike those late terrific sleeps
and groans that rage of racking famine spoke
where looks inhuman dwelt on festering heaps
the breathing pestilence that rose like smoke
the shriek that from the distant battle broke
the mines dire earthquake and the pallid host
driven by the bombs incessant thunderstroke
to loathsome vaults where heartsick anguish tossd
hope died and fear itself in agony was lost


yet does that burst of woe congeal my frame
when the dark streets appeared to heave and gape
while like a sea the storming army came
and fire from hell reared his gigantic shape
and murder by the ghastly gleam and rape
seized their joint prey the mother and the child
but from these crazing thoughts my brain escape
for weeks the balmy air breathed soft and mild
and on the gliding vessel heaven and ocean smiled


some mighty gulph of separation past
i seemed transported to another world
a thought resigned with pain when from the mast
the impatient mariner the sail unfurld
and whistling called the wind that hardly curled
the silent sea from the sweet thoughts of home
and from all hope i was forever hurled
for mefarthest from earthly port to roam
was best could i but shun the spot where man might come


and oft robbd of my perfect mind i thought
at last my feet a restingplace had found
here will i weep in peace so fancy wrought
roaming the illimitable waters round
here watch of every human friend disowned
all day my ready tomb the oceanflood
to break my dream the vessel reached its bound
and homeless near a thousand homes i stood
and near a thousand tables pined and wanted food


by grief enfeebled was i turned adrift
helpless as sailor cast on desart rock
nor morsel to my mouth that day did lift
nor dared my hand at any door to knock
i lay where with his drowsy mates the cock
from the cross timber of an outhouse hung
how dismal tolled that night the city clock
at morn my sick heart hunger scarcely stung
nor to the beggars language could i frame my tongue


so passed another day and so the third
then did i try in vain the crowds resort
in deep despair by frightful wishes stirrd
near the seaside i reached a ruined fort
there pains which nature could no more support
with blindness linked did on my vitals fall
dizzy my brain with interruption short
of hideous sense i sunk nor step could crawl
and thence was borne away to neighbouring hospital


recovery came with food but still my brain
was weak nor of the past had memory
i heard my neighbours in their beds complain
of many things which never troubled me
of feet still bustling round with busy glee
of looks where common kindness had no part
of service done with careless cruelty
fretting the fever round the languid heart
and groans which as they said would make a dead man start


these things just served to stir the torpid sense
nor pain nor pity in my bosom raised
memory though slow returned with strength and thence
dismissed again on open day i gazed
at houses men and common light amazed
the lanes i sought and as the sun retired
came where beneath the trees a faggot blazed
the wild brood saw me weep my fate enquired
and gave me food and rest more welcome more desired


my heart is touched to think that men like these
the rude earths tenants were my first relief
how kindly did they paint their vagrant ease
and their long holiday that feared not grief
for all belonged to all and each was chief
no plough their sinews strained on grating road
no wain they drove and yet the yellow sheaf
in every vale for their delight was stowed
for them in natures meads the milky udder flowed


semblance with straw and pauniered ass they made
of potters wandering on from door to door
but life of happier sort to me pourtrayed
and other joys my fancy to allure
the bagpipe dinning on the midnight moor
in barn uplighted and companions boon
well met from far with revelry secure
in depth of forest glade when jocund june
rolled fast along the sky his warm and genial moon


but ill it suited me in journey dark
oer moor and mountain midnight theft to hatch
to charm the surly housedogs faithful bark
or hang on tiptoe at the lifted latch
the gloomy lantern and the dim blue match
the black disguise the warning whistle shrill
and ear still busy on its nightly watch
were not for me brought up in nothing ill
besides on griefs so fresh my thoughts were brooding still


what could i do unaided and unblest
poor father gone was every friend of thine
and kindred of dead husband are at best
small help and after marriage such as mine
with little kindness would to me incline
ill was i then for toil or service fit
with tears whose course no effort could confine
by highway side forgetful would i sit
whole hours my idle arms in moping sorrow knit


i lived upon the mercy of the fields
and oft of cruelty the sky accused
on hazard or what general bounty yields
now coldly given now utterly refused
the fields i for my bed have often used
but what afflicts my peace with keenest ruth
is that i have my inner self abused
foregone the home delight of constant truth
and clear and open soul so prized in fearless youth


three years a wanderer often have i viewd
in tears the sun towards that country tend
where my poor heart lost all its fortitude
and now across this moor my steps i bend
oh tell me whitherfor no earthly friend
have ishe ceased and weeping turned away
as if because her tale was at an end
she weptbecause she had no more to say
of that perpetual weight which on her spirit lay


oh whats the matter whats the matter
what ist that ails young harry gill
that evermore his teeth they chatter
chatter chatter chatter still
of waistcoats harry has no lack
good duffle grey and flannel fine
he has a blanket on his back
and coats enough to smother nine


in march december and in july
tis all the same with harry gill
the neighbours tell and tell you truly
his teeth they chatter chatter still
at night at morning and at noon
tis all the same with harry gill
beneath the sun beneath the moon
his teeth they chatter chatter still


young harry was a lusty drover
and who so stout of limb as he
his cheeks were red as ruddy clover
his voice was like the voice of three
auld goody blake was old and poor
ill fedd she was and thinly clad
and any man who passd her door
might see how poor a hut she had


all day she spun in her poor dwelling
and then her three hours work at night
alas twas hardly worth the telling
it would not pay for candlelight
this woman dwelt in dorsetshire
her hut was on a cold hillside
and in that country coals are dear
for they come far by wind and tide


by the same fire to boil their pottage
two poor old dames as i have known
will often live in one small cottage
but she poor woman dwelt alone
twas well enough when summer came
the long warm lightsome summerday
then at her door the _canty_ dame
would sit as any linnet gay


but when the ice our streams did fetter
oh then how her old bones would shake
you would have said if you had met her
twas a hard time for goody blake
her evenings then were dull and dead
sad case it was as you may think
for very cold to go to bed
and then for cold not sleep a wink


oh joy for her when eer in winter
the winds at night had made a rout
and scatterd many a lusty splinter
and many a rotten bough about
yet never had she well or sick
as every man who knew her says
a pile beforehand wood or stick
enough to warm her for three days


now when the frost was past enduring
and made her poor old bones to ache
could any thing be more alluring
than an old hedge to goody blake
and now and then it must be said
when her old bones were cold and chill
she left her fire or left her bed
to seek the hedge of harry gill


now harry he had long suspected
this trespass of old goody blake
and vowd that she should be detected
and he on her would vengeance take
and oft from his warm fire hed go
and to the fields his road would take
and there at night in frost and snow
he watchd to seize old goody blake


and once behind a rick of barley
thus looking out did harry stand
the moon was full and shining clearly
and crisp with frost the stubbleland
he hears a noisehes all awake
againon tiptoe down the hill
he softly creepstis goody blake
shes at the hedge of harry gill


right glad was he when he beheld her
stick after stick did goody pull
he stood behind a bush of elder
till she had filled her apron full
when with her load she turned about
the byeroad back again to take
he started forward with a shout
and sprang upon poor goody blake


and fiercely by the arm he took her
and by the arm he held her fast
and fiercely by the arm he shook her
and cried ive caught you then at last
then goody who had nothing said
her bundle from her lap let fall
and kneeling on the sticks she prayd
to god that is the judge of all


she prayd her witherd hand uprearing
while harry held her by the arm
god who art never out of hearing
o may he never more be warm
the cold cold moon above her head
thus on her knees did goody pray
young harry heard what she had said
and icycold he turned away


he went complaining all the morrow
that he was cold and very chill
his face was gloom his heart was sorrow
alas that day for harry gill
that day he wore a ridingcoat
but not a whit the warmer he
another was on thursday brought
and ere the sabbath he had three


twas all in vain a useless matter
and blankets were about him pinnd
yet still his jaws and teeth they clatter
like a loose casement in the wind
and harrys flesh it fell away
and all who see him say tis plain
that live as long as live he may
he never will be warm again


no word to any man he utters
abed or up to young or old
but ever to himself he mutters
poor harry gill is very cold
abed or up by night or day
his teeth they chatter chatter still
now think ye farmers all i pray
of goody blake and harry gill


it is the first mild day of march
each minute sweeter than before
the redbreast sings from the tall larch
that stands beside our door


there is a blessing in the air
which seems a sense of joy to yield
to the bare trees and mountains bare
and grass in the green field


my sister tis a wish of mine
now that our morning meal is done
make haste your morning task resign
come forth and feel the sun


edward will come with you and pray
put on with speed your woodland dress
and bring no book for this one day
well give to idleness


no joyless forms shall regulate
our living calendar
we from today my friend will date
the opening of the year


love now an universal birth
from heart to heart is stealing
from earth to man from man to earth
it is the hour of feeling


one moment now may give us more
than fifty years of reason
our minds shall drink at every pore
the spirit of the season


some silent laws our hearts may make
which they shall long obey
we for the year to come may take
our temper from today


and from the blessed power that rolls
about below above
well frame the measure of our souls
they shall be tuned to love


then come my sister come i pray
with speed put on your woodland dress
and bring no book for this one day
well give to idleness


in the sweet shire of cardigan
not far from pleasant ivorhall
an old man dwells a little man
ive heard he once was tall
of years he has upon his back
no doubt a burthen weighty
he says he is three score and ten
but others say hes eighty


a long blue liverycoat has he
thats fair behind and fair before
yet meet him where you will you see
at once that he is poor
full five and twenty years he lived
a running huntsman merry
and though he has but one eye left
his cheek is like a cherry


no man like him the horn could sound
and no man was so full of glee
to say the least four counties round
had heard of simon lee
his masters dead and no one now
dwells in the hall of ivor
men dogs and horses all are dead
he is the sole survivor


his hunting feats have him bereft
of his right eye as you may see
and then what limbs those feats have left
to poor old simon lee
he has no son he has no child
his wife an aged woman
lives with him near the waterfall
upon the village common


and he is lean and he is sick
his little bodys half awry
his ancles they are swoln and thick
his legs are thin and dry
when he was young he little knew
of husbandry or tillage
and now hes forced to work though weak
the weakest in the village


he all the country could outrun
could leave both man and horse behind
and often ere the race was done
he reeled and was stoneblind
and still theres something in the world
at which his heart rejoices
for when the chiming hounds are out
he dearly loves their voices


old ruth works out of doors with him
and does what simon cannot do
for she not over stout of limb
is stouter of the two
and though you with your utmost skill
from labour could not wean them
alas tis very little all
which they can do between them


beside their mossgrown hut of clay
not twenty paces from the door
a scrap of land they have but they
are poorest of the poor
this scrap of land he from the heath
enclosed when he was stronger
but what avails the land to them
which they can till no longer


few months of life has he in store
as he to you will tell
for still the more he works the more
his poor old ancles swell
my gentle reader i perceive
how patiently youve waited
and im afraid that you expect
some tale will be related


o reader had you in your mind
such stores as silent thought can bring
o gentle reader you would find
a tale in every thing
what more i have to say is short
i hope youll kindly take it
it is no tale but should you think
perhaps a tale youll make it


one summerday i chanced to see
this old man doing all he could
about the root of an old tree
a stump of rotten wood
the mattock totterd in his hand
so vain was his endeavour
that at the root of the old tree
he might have worked for ever


youre overtasked good simon lee
give me your tool to him i said
and at the word right gladly he
received my profferd aid
i struck and with a single blow
the tangled root i severd
at which the poor old man so long
and vainly had endeavourd


the tears into his eyes were brought
and thanks and praises seemed to run
so fast out of his heart i thought
they never would have done
ive heard of hearts unkind kind deeds
with coldness still returning
alas the gratitude of men
has oftner left me mourning


i have a boy of five years old
his face is fair and fresh to see
his limbs are cast in beautys mould
and dearly he loves me


one morn we strolld on our dry walk
our quiet house all full in view
and held such intermitted talk
as we are wont to do


my thoughts on former pleasures ran
i thought of kilves delightful shore
my pleasant home when spring began
a long long year before


a day it was when i could bear
to think and think and think again
with so much happiness to spare
i could not feel a pain


my boy was by my side so slim
and graceful in his rustic dress
and oftentimes i talked to him
in very idleness


the young lambs ran a pretty race
the morning sun shone bright and warm
kilve said i was a pleasant place
and so is liswyn farm


my little boy which like you more
i said and took him by the arm
our home by kilves delightful shore
or here at liswyn farm


and tell me had you rather be
i said and held him by the arm
at kilves smooth shore by the green sea
or here at liswyn farm


in careless mood he looked at me
while still i held him by the arm
and said at kilve id rather be
than here at liswyn farm


now little edward say why so
my little edward tell me why
i cannot tell i do not know
why this is strange said i


for here are woods and greenhills warm
there surely must some reason be
why you would change sweet liswyn farm
for kilve by the green sea


at this my boy so fair and slim
hung down his head nor made reply
and five times did i say to him
why edward tell me why


his head he raisedthere was in sight
it caught his eye he saw it plain
upon the housetop glittering bright
a broad and gilded vane


then did the boy his tongue unlock
and thus to me he made reply
at kilve there was no weathercock
and thats the reason why


oh dearest dearest boy my heart
for better lore would seldom yearn
could i but teach the hundredth part
of what from thee i learn


a simple child dear brother jim
that lightly draws its breath
and feels its life in every limb
what should it know of death


i met a little cottage girl
she was eight years old she said
her hair was thick with many a curl
that clusterd round her head


she had a rustic woodland air
and she was wildly clad
her eyes were fair and very fair
her beauty made me glad


sisters and brothers little maid
how many may you be
how many seven in all she said
and wondering looked at me


and where are they i pray you tell
she answered seven are we
and two of us at conway dwell
and two are gone to sea


two of us in the churchyard lie
my sister and my brother
and in the churchyard cottage i
dwell near them with my mother


you say that two at conway dwell
and two are gone to sea
yet you are seven i pray you tell
sweet maid how this may be


then did the little maid reply
seven boys and girls are we
two of us in the churchyard lie
beneath the churchyard tree


you run about my little maid
your limbs they are alive
if two are in the churchyard laid
then ye are only five


their graves are green they may be seen
the little maid replied
twelve steps or more from my mothers door
and they are side by side


my stockings there i often knit
my kerchief there i hem
and there upon the ground i sit
i sit and sing to them


and often after sunset sir
when it is light and fair
i take my little porringer
and eat my supper there


the first that died was little jane
in bed she moaning lay
till god released her of her pain
and then she went away


so in the churchyard she was laid
and all the summer dry
together round her grave we played
my brother john and i


and when the ground was white with snow
and i could run and slide
my brother john was forced to go
and he lies by her side


how many are you then said i
if they two are in heaven
the little maiden did reply
o master we are seven


but they are dead those two are dead
their spirits are in heaven
twas throwing words away for still
the little maid would have her will
and said nay we are seven


i heard a thousand blended notes
while in a grove i sate reclined
in that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts
bring sad thoughts to the mind


to her fair works did nature link
the human soul that through me ran
and much it grievd my heart to think
what man has made of man


through primrosetufts in that sweet bower
the periwinkle traild its wreathes
and tis my faith that every flower
enjoys the air it breathes


the birds around me hoppd and playd
their thoughts i cannot measure
but the least motion which they made
it seemd a thrill of pleasure


the budding twigs spread out their fan
to catch the breezy air
and i must think do all i can
that there was pleasure there


if i these thoughts may not prevent
if such be of my creed the plan
have i not reason to lament
what man has made of man


in distant countries i have been
and yet i have not often seen
a healthy man a man full grown
weep in the public roads alone
but such a one on english ground
and in the broad highway i met
along the broad highway he came
his cheeks with tears were wet
sturdy he seemed though he was sad
and in his arms a lamb he had


he saw me and he turned aside
as if he wished himself to hide
then with his coat he made essay
to wipe those briny tears away
i followd him and said my friend
what ails you wherefore weep you so
shame on me sir this lusty lamb
he makes my tears to flow
today i fetched him from the rock
he is the last of all my flock


when i was young a single man
and after youthful follies ran
though little given to care and thought
yet so it was a ewe i bought
and other sheep from her i raised
as healthy sheep as you might see
and then i married and was rich
as i could wish to be
of sheep i numberd a full score
and every year encreasd my store


year after year my stock it grew
and from this one this single ewe
full fifty comely sheep i raised
as sweet a flock as ever grazed
upon the mountain did they feed
they throve and we at home did thrive
this lusty lamb of all my store
is all that is alive
and now i care not if we die
and perish all of poverty


ten children sir had i to feed
hard labour in a time of need
my pride was tamed and in our grief
i of the parish askd relief
they said i was a wealthy man
my sheep upon the mountain fed
and it was fit that thence i took
whereof to buy us bread
do this how can we give to you
they cried what to the poor is due


i sold a sheep as they had said
and bought my little children bread
and they were healthy with their food
for me it never did me good
a woeful time it was for me
to see the end of all my gains
the pretty flock which i had reared
with all my care and pains
to see it melt like snow away
for me it was a woeful day


another still and still another
a little lamb and then its mother
it was a vein that never stoppd
like blooddrops from my heart they droppd
till thirty were not left alive
they dwindled dwindled one by one
and i may say that many a time
i wished they all were gone
they dwindled one by one away
for me it was a woeful day


to wicked deeds i was inclined
and wicked fancies crossd my mind
and every man i chancd to see
i thought he knew some ill of me
no peace no comfort could i find
no ease within doors or without
and crazily and wearily
i went my work about
ofttimes i thought to run away
for me it was a woeful day


sir twas a precious flock to me
as dear as my own children be
for daily with my growing store
i loved my children more and more
alas it was an evil time
god cursed me in my sore distress
i prayed yet every day i thought
i loved my children less
and every week and every day
my flock it seemed to melt away


they dwindled sir sad sight to see
from ten to five from five to three
a lamb a weather and a ewe
and then at last from three to two
and of my fifty yesterday
i had but only one
and here it lies upon my arm
alas and i have none
today i fetched it from the rock
it is the last of all my flock


her eyes are wild her head is bare
the sun has burnt her coalblack hair
her eyebrows have a rusty stain
and she came far from over the main
she has a baby on her arm
or else she were alone
and underneath the haystack warm
and on the greenwood stone
she talked and sung the woods among
and it was in the english tongue


sweet babe they say that i am mad
but nay my heart is far too glad
and i am happy when i sing
full many a sad and doleful thing
then lovely baby do not fear
i pray thee have no fear of me
but safe as in a cradle here
my lovely baby thou shalt be
to thee i know too much i owe
i cannot work thee any woe


a fire was once within my brain
and in my head a dull dull pain
and fiendish faces one two three
hung at my breasts and pulled at me
but then there came a sight of joy
it came at once to do me good
i waked and saw my little boy
my little boy of flesh and blood
oh joy for me that sight to see
for he was here and only he


suck little babe oh suck again
it cools my blood it cools my brain
thy lips i feel them baby they
draw from my heart the pain away
oh press me with thy little hand
it loosens something at my chest
about that tight and deadly band
i feel thy little fingers pressd
the breeze i see is in the tree
it comes to cool my babe and me


oh love me love me little boy
thou art thy mothers only joy
and do not dread the waves below
when oer the searocks edge we go
the high crag cannot work me harm
nor leaping torrents when they howl
the babe i carry on my arm
he saves for me my precious soul
then happy lie for blest am i
without me my sweet babe would die


then do not fear my boy for thee
bold as a lion i will be
and i will always be thy guide
through hollow snows and rivers wide
ill build an indian bower i know
the leaves that make the softest bed
and if from me thou wilt not go
but still be true till i am dead
my pretty thing then thou shalt sing
as merry as the birds in spring


thy father cares not for my breast
tis thine sweet baby there to rest
tis all thine own and if its hue
be changed that was so fair to view
tis fair enough for thee my dove
my beauty little child is flown
but thou wilt live with me in love
and what if my poor cheek be brown
tis well for me thou canst not see
how pale and wan it else would be


dread not their taunts my little life
i am thy fathers wedded wife
and underneath the spreading tree
we two will live in honesty
if his sweet boy he could forsake
with me he never would have stayd
from him no harm my babe can take
but he poor man is wretched made
and every day we two will pray
for him thats gone and far away


ill teach my boy the sweetest things
ill teach him how the owlet sings
my little babe thy lips are still
and thou hast almost suckd thy fill
where art thou gone my own dear child
what wicked looks are those i see
alas alas that look so wild
it never never came from me
if thou art mad my pretty lad
then i must be for ever sad


oh smile on me my little lamb
for i thy own dear mother am
my love for thee has well been tried
ive sought thy father far and wide
i know the poisons of the shade
i know the earthnuts fit for food
then pretty dear be not afraid
well find thy father in the wood
now laugh and be gay to the woods away
and there my babe well live for aye


how rich the wave in front imprest
with eveningtwilights summer hues
while facing thus the crimson west
the boat her silent path pursues
and see how dark the backward stream
a little moment past so smiling
and still perhaps with faithless gleam
some other loiterer beguiling


such views the youthful bard allure
but heedless of the following gloom
he deems their colours shall endure
till peace go with him to the tomb
and let him nurse his fond deceit
and what if he must die in sorrow
who would not cherish dreams so sweet
though grief and pain may come tomorrow


glide gently thus for ever glide
o thames that other bards may see
as lovely visions by thy side
as now fair river come to me
oh glide fair stream for ever so
thy quiet soul on all bestowing
till all our minds for ever flow
as thy deep waters now are flowing


vain thought yet be as now thou art
that in thy waters may be seen
the image of a poets heart
how bright how solemn how serene
such heart did once the poet bless
who pouring here ac _later_ ditty
could find no refuge from distress
but in the milder grief of pity


remembrance as we glide along
for him suspend the dashing oar
and pray that never child of song
may know his freezing sorrows more
how calm how still the only sound
the dripping of the oar suspended
the evening darkness gathers round
by virtues holiest powers attended


why william on that old grey stone
thus for the length of half a day
why william sit you thus alone
and dream your time away


where are your books that light bequeathd
to beings else forlorn and blind
up up and drink the spirit breathd
from dead men to their kind


you look round on your mother earth
as if she for no purpose bore you
as if you were her firstborn birth
and none had lived before you


one morning thus by esthwaite lake
when life was sweet i knew not why
to me my good friend matthew spake
and thus i made reply


the eye it cannot chuse but see
we cannot bid the ear be still
our bodies feel whereer they be
against or with our will


nor less i deem that there are powers
which of themselves our minds impress
that we can feed this mind of ours
in a wise passiveness


think you mid all this mighty sum
of things for ever speaking
that nothing of itself will come
but we must still be seeking


then ask not wherefore here alone
conversing as i may
i sit upon this old grey stone
and dream my time away


up up my friend and clear your looks
why all this toil and trouble
up up my friend and quit your books
or surely youll grow double


the sun above the mountains head
a freshening lustre mellow
through all the long green fields has spread
his first sweet evening yellow


books tis a dull and endless strife
come hear the woodland linnet
how sweet his music on my life
theres more of wisdom in it


and hark how blithe the throstle sings
and he is no mean preacher
come forth into the light of things
let nature be your teacher


she has a world of ready wealth
our minds and hearts to bless
spontaneous wisdom breathed by health
truth breathed by chearfulness


one impulse from a vernal wood
may teach you more of man
of moral evil and of good
than all the sages can


sweet is the lore which nature brings
our meddling intellect
misshapes the beauteous forms of things
we murder to dissect


enough of science and of art
close up these barren leaves
come forth and bring with you a heart
that watches and receives


before i see another day
oh let my body die away
in sleep i heard the northern gleams
the stars they were among my dreams
in sleep did i behold the skies
i saw the crackling flashes drive
and yet they are upon my eyes
and yet i am alive
before i see another day
oh let my body die away


my fire is dead it knew no pain
yet is it dead and i remain
all stiff with ice the ashes lie
and they are dead and i will die
when i was well i wished to live
for clothes for warmth for food and fire
but they to me no joy can give
no pleasure now and no desire
then here contented will i lie
alone i cannot fear to die


alas you might have dragged me on
another day a single one
too soon despair oer me prevailed
too soon my heartless spirit failed
when you were gone my limbs were stronger
and oh how grievously i rue
that afterwards a little longer
my friends i did not follow you
for strong and without pain i lay
my friends when you were gone away


my child they gave thee to another
a woman who was not thy mother
when from my arms my babe they took
on me how strangely did he look
through his whole body something ran
a most strange something did i see
as if he strove to be a man
that he might pull the sledge for me
and then he stretched his arms how wild
oh mercy like a little child


my little joy my little pride
in two days more i must have died
then do not weep and grieve for me
i feel i must have died with thee
oh wind that oer my head art flying
the way my friends their course did bend
i should not feel the pain of dying
could i with thee a message send
too soon my friends you went away
for i had many things to say


ill follow you across the snow
you travel heavily and slow
in spite of all my weary pain
ill look upon your tents again
my fire is dead and snowy white
the water which beside it stood
the wolf has come to me tonight
and he has stolen away my food
for ever left alone am i
then wherefore should i fear to die


my journey will be shortly run
i shall not see another sun
i cannot lift my limbs to know
if they have any life or no
my poor forsaken child if i
for once could have thee close to me
with happy heart i then would die
and my last thoughts would happy be
i feel my body die away
i shall not see another day


the glory of evening was spread through the west
on the slope of a mountain i stood
while the joy that precedes the calm season of rest
rang loud through the meadow and wood


and must we then part from a dwelling so fair
in the pain of my spirit i said
and with a deep sadness i turned to repair
to the cell where the convict is laid


the thickribbed walls that oershadow the gate
resound and the dungeons unfold
i pause and at length through the glimmering grate
that outcast of pity behold


his black matted head on his shoulder is bent
and deep is the sigh of his breath
and with stedfast dejection his eyes are intent
on the fetters that link him to death


tis sorrow enough on that visage to gaze
that body dismissd from his care
yet my fancy has pierced to his heart and pourtrays
more terrible images there


his bones are consumed and his lifeblood is dried
with wishes the past to undo
and his crime through the pains that oerwhelm him descried
still blackens and grows on his view


when from the dark synod or bloodreeking field
to his chamber the monarch is led
all soothers of sense their soft virtue shall yield
and quietness pillow his head


but if grief selfconsumed in oblivion would doze
and conscience her tortures appease
mid tumult and uproar this man must repose
in the comfortless vault of disease


when his fetters at night have so pressd on his limbs
that the weight can no longer be borne
if while a halfslumber his memory bedims
the wretch on his pallet should turn


while the jailmastiff howls at the dull clanking chain
from the roots of his hair there shall start
a thousand sharp punctures of coldsweating pain
and terror shall leap at his heart


but now he halfraises his deepsunken eye
and the motion unsettles a tear
the silence of sorrow it seems to supply
and asks of me why i am here


poor victim no idle intruder has stood
with oerweening complacence our state to compare
but one whose first wish is the wish to be good
is come as a brother thy sorrows to share


at thy name though compassion her nature resign
though in virtues proud mouth thy report be a stain
my care if the arm of the mighty were mine
would plant thee where yet thou mightst blossom again
