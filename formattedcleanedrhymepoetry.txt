so charitable to religious end
in all her petite actions so devote
as her whole life was now become one note
of piety and private holiness
she spent more time in tears her self to dress
for her devotions and those sad essays
of sorrow then all pomp of gaudy days
and came forth ever cheered with the rod
of divine comfort when sh had talkd with god
her broken sighs did never miss whole sense
nor can the bruised heart want eloquence
for prayer is the incense most perfumes
the holy altars when it least presumes
and hers were all humility they beat
the door of grace and found the mercyseat
in frequent speaking by the pious psalms
her solemn hours she spent or giving alms
or doing other deeds of charity
to clothe the naked feed the hungry she
would sit in an infirmerinfirmary whole days
poring as on a map to find the ways
to that eternal rest where now sh hath place
by sure election and predestind grace
she saw her saviour by an early light
incarnate in the manger shining bright
on all the world she saw him on the cross
suffring and dying to redeem our loss
she saw him rise triumphing over death
to justifie and quicken us in breath
she saw him too in glory to ascend
for his designed work the perfect end
of raising judging and rewarding all
the kind of man on whom his doom should fall
all this by faith she saw and framd a plea
in manner of a daily apostrophe

hath given wholly to the son the rather

not those new fangled toys and triming slight
which takes our late fantasticks with delight

and loudly knock to have their passage out

fly swiftly to this fair assemblys ears

such as may make thee search thy coffers round

such where the deep transported mind may scare
above the wheeling poles and at heavns dore
look in and see each blissful deitie

listening to what unshorn apollo sings
to thtouch of golden wires while hebe brings
immortal nectar to her kingly sire
then passing through the spherse of watchful fire
and mistie regions of wide air next under
and hills of snow and lofts of piled thunder
may tell at length how greeneyd neptune raves
in heavns defiance mustering all his waves
then sing of secret things that came to pass
when beldam nature in her cradle was
and last of kings and queens and heros old
such as the wise demodocus once told
in solemn songs at king alcinous feast
while sad ulisses soul and all the rest
are held with his melodious harmonie
in willing chains and sweet captivitie

expectance calls thee now another way

tis the nymph that i courted some ten years ago

that some verses were writ with felonious intent
direct to the north where i never once went
that the letters appeard reversed through the pane

for each bard believed hed a right to the place
so finding the assembly grow warm in debate
he put them in mind of his phaethons fate
twas urged to no purpose disputes higher rose
scarce phoebus himself could their quarrels compose
till at length he determined that every bard
should each in his turn be patiently heard
first one who believed he excelld in translation
founds his claim on the doctrine of mans transmigration

i refuse you because you could stoop to be great

by your works it appears you have much of my spirit
i esteem you so well that to tell you the truth
the greatest objection against yous your youth

who admires the ancients and knows tis their due
yet writes in a manner entirely new
though none with more ease their depths can explore
yet whatever he wants he takes from my store

enlighten the world by reflecting my rays

with farthing candle for a torch

then hebe came and took her place
but showd no more than half her face
whateer these dire forebodings meant
in joy the marriageday was spent
the marriage_day_ you take me right
i promise nothing for the night
the bridegroom drest to make a figure
assumes an artificial vigour
a flourishd nightcap on to grace

to cheapen tea and talk with fops
or calls a council of her maids
and tradesmen to compare brocades

minds nothing that is done or said

the dean who used to dine at one
is mawkish and his stomachs gone
in threadbare gown would scarce a louse hold
looks like the chaplain of the household

in french brocades and flanders lace

but never asks or asks in vain
his mind is full of other cares
and in the sneaking parsons airs
computes that half a parish dues
will hardly find his wife in shoes

ran under ground from greece to britain

was bribed to make the dean agree

are proper in my ladys case
with which she patiently complies
merely because her friends advise
his money and her time employs
in music rafflingrooms and toys
or in the crossbath seeks an heir
since others oft have found one there

paid to him clear money once every year
and however some think it a little too dear
yet for reasons of state this sum well allow
though we pay the good man with the sweat of our brow
first because by the king to us he was sent
to guide the whole session of this parliament
to preside in our councils both public and private
and so learn by the by what both houses do drive at
